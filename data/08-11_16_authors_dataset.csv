"The biggest surprise of the whole breast implant scandal is, of course, how many women have had them, and naturally I disagree in principle with self-mutilation in the service of a bogus ideal. Yet what's really struck me is how often it is noted that the implants were produced by a French company. Since the scandal originated in France, it's natural to mention that. Often, though, the nationality of its head, Jean-Claude Mas, has been pointed out two or three times in one article. The preponderance of French manufacturers in breast augmentation is a discernible global quirk – in Venezuala, where plastic surgery is very common, 84% of implants come from French companies. And I guess there is a subtextual observation about the notorious ""perfectionism"" (we call it ""body fascism"", but that's because we're so fat and Anglo-Saxon) of the French, with their elaborate terror of ageing and phenomenal appetite for anti-cellulite products. But this story reminds me of the fact that, whenever there's a conversation about the dark forces ranged around disability benefit, it is always pointed out that Atos is also a French company. To recap: Atos assesses claimants for disability benefits, a contract that it was awarded in 2005, running for seven years and worth £500m. This contract should be up for renewal in 2012 and, given the large amount of public distress and anger at this company, coupled with the prospect of unemployment in the UK reaching 2.85m next year, it could be awarded to someone else – possibly, call me crazy, a company with more employees in the UK (although I think this is what's called ""protectionism""). Also, Atos has just been awarded another huge contract for GP IT services, as well as a contract for the Olympics. So we're staring down the barrel of one of those ""procurement situations"", where all the commonsense solutions – a company closely connected to the area? a company that people don't already hate with a passion? – have been rejected for reasons that you have to be in the government to understand. The complaints against Atos are varied (the company calls itself global, by the way, but is listed on the French securities market). In the course of their computer-generated questionnaires, Atos assessors have been accused of rarely making eye contact with the patient, and taking no account of little things like the wide range of outcomes for the same disease, or the intricacies of mental illness. (""Can you pick up a pencil?"" they'll ask someone with terminal cancer, or bipolar disorder. ""Yes? Well, back to work with you; back to one of those nonexistent jobs that you'll never get."") These analysts have only six weeks' training in ""disability analysis"", and are not required to be experts in the field of the illness in question; yet their opinion takes contractual priority over that of the patient's consultant – which is to say, it's in Atos's contract with the DWP, which I suppose makes sense from the point of view of the government department. There's no sense blowing £500m on a service and then not listening to it. If only there were some other, meaningful opinions we could solicit freely, some kind of national health service … The iniquity of this process will no doubt run and run. But increasingly, I find unsatisfactory the explanation that it's the foreignness of these large corporations that is the major contributor to their shortcomings. It has become ever clearer, as money's got tighter, that the entire business of commissioning out public services is a stitch-up to suck yet more money out of the public purse and into four or five private ones. So previously, when I heard that Geo (American) or Amey (French) was tendering for a government contract, my immediate suspicion was that a global company will not care enough about its end user; that the reason PIP made low-grade breast implants is the same reason an Atos representative won't meet a cancer patient's eye when they fill in the form: empathy is a function of proximity, and the further away you, as the company's chief executive, are from your – well, let's call them your ""victim"" for brevity – the easier it is to disregard them. On a micro-level it's perfectly logical: you'd do a better job for your next-door neighbour than for someone you'd never see again. But I think this is too easy an explanation to swallow, as opposed to the more problematic idea that it's not a foreigner with a profit motive, but the profit motive itself, that distorts and poisons the relationships of healthcare. Who speaks out when patient care suffers because of budget cuts? Not private doctors, nor ""any willing provider"", but the BMA, the Royal College of GPs, the Patients' Association – in other words, the public sector and the third sector. When profit is involved, something fundamental can happen to service providers: the danger is they become more attentive to the needs of the paymaster than the patient. This is about profit, not nationality.","Disability assessment may be a farce, but it's not French | Zoe Williams",2011-12-28T19:00:01Z,Zoe Williams,society
"I shouldn't like it. Not at all. My upbringing – regular synagogue attendance, Hebrew classes twice a week, a kosher home – was meant to inoculate me against it, ensuring that I would recoil at the mere mention of the word. And yet – and here I need to lower my voice to a whisper – I am strangely drawn to the story of Jesus. Jews don't even like saying the name too loud. The Talmud refers to him only as ""that man"". Plenty of Jews use the Yiddish name Yoshke, which sounds more unflattering than it looks on the page. Now that I think about it, I remember my grandfather preferring the word ""Yoizel"", which has a slightly gentler ring to it – so maybe I picked up this habit from him. The point is, Jews don't go in for Jesus. So-called Messianic Jews, ""Jews for Jesus"", are ostracised almost universally by other Jews. The religion founded in Jesus's name may have been good news for Christians, but it usually spelled trouble and persecution for the Jews. So, for people like me, an interest in Jesus is a little taboo. Not that I'm a crypto-follower or Christian-curious or anything, don't get me wrong. I know lots of lefties bang on about how Jesus was the first socialist and all that, but that's not the draw for me. No, what pulls me in is the Jesus story. I wasn't taught it in school and I didn't read it in the gospels. My first exposure came on TV, in the form of those Jesus films they always show at Easter. I think it was the ATV movie, Jesus of Nazareth, that got me hooked (produced, incidentally, by the unmistakably Jewish Lew Grade). But from then on I was a sucker for any telling and retelling: whether Hollywood epics, such as The Greatest Story Ever Told, musicals like Jesus Christ Superstar, or even cunning modern-day adaptations – think Godspell or Jesus of Montreal. I lapped them all up. A psychologist would say it's the taboo that does it. Especially if they knew that that first, childhood viewing of Jesus of Nazareth coincided – as Easter so often does – with the first night of the Jewish festival of Passover. I was watching Robert Powell get crucified when I should have been preparing the seder table. What for most people is a tale associated with Sunday school tedium carried for me the frisson of the forbidden. But I'm afraid I don't think that explains it. The truth is, the Jesus story is the ultimate political drama. Imagine it: a radical firebrand, whom the powerful want to silence and shut down. But the threat is not only external. He also faces a hidden challenge from within his own inner circle, a traitor in his midst … I admit that I brace myself when I come to hear the story told again, whether through radio drama, rock opera or, say, some BBC experimental production on the streets of Manchester. I worry: will this version blame the Romans or the Jews? Of course it's always best when Pilate, the Roman occupier who gave the order, is the bad guy; certainly better than any suggestion, coded or otherwise, that it is the Jews who should bear the weight of guilt. I like to think Jesus himself would understand this nervousness on my part. After all, and this is remembered less often than it might be, he was Jewish too.",The story of Jesus is the ultimate political drama | Jonathan Freedland,2011-12-24T09:10:00Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"It was 1987, and I was 17, that eager and impressionable age when booze, nightclubs and inconclusive romantic encounters embody all the wonderment that the adult world has to offer. Most weeks, I would go to a Mancunian place called – but of course – Brahms and Liszt, with the obligatory half-inch of white sock on show, and hopes of making it to my sixth pint of lager. The DJ there habitually played a Simply Red song called The Right Thing, a number 11 hit, which, what with its apparent cross-referencing of football and human intimacy, my thinking brain now understands as a prime contender for an imaginary pop bad-sex award (""Feel I'm getting harder now … Get off your back four! Get on top more! Owwww!""), but my heart will never let go. And from that point onwards, Mick ""Hucko"" Hucknall and his hugely successful pop-soul vehicle formed an anomalous but immovable part of my musical tastes. Within months, I would leave Brahms and Liszt behind, and move on to the justifiably legendary Hacienda club, but always keep an eye on what he and his ever-shifting backing group were up to. In 1991, they released their faultless meisterwerk Stars. The following year, I was a newly appointed writer at the NME, and well on to my seventh pint of lager, when out it came: ""I like Simply Red"" – which, by implication, meant I was not fully on board with the Maoist indie conspiracy. My colleagues visibly bristled. After pint number eight, I think I put The Right Thing on the pub jukebox. ""Get on top more!"" shouted Hucko; the wind howled around our table. The case for the defence is straightforward enough, and remains so. Hucknall can sing, arguably better than any British vocalist of the last 30 years: to take one example from many, as an example of perfect delivery, his performance on For Your Babies sits in the same rarefied place as, say, Etta James's I'd Rather Go Blind, Dolly Parton's Here You Come Again, and Smokey Robinson's Tracks of My Tears. His self-written repertoire is studded with triumphs, and he usually picks a good cover. When surveying his life and work, it's worth bearing in mind that he's from Denton (look it up, if necessary). And, not that it says much about his art, but I met him once, in some London hellhole that struck me as being like Brahms and Liszt for people with pots of money. He was funny and surprisingly self-deprecating; I even began to forgive him both his fondness for Tony Blair, and his cartoonish embrace of a sitcom writer's understanding of the high life (putting up money for the grimly ""aspirational"" Malmaison hotel chain, starting his own Italian wine label called Il Cantate, which translates as – but of course – ""the singer""). Really: unless you're still clinging on to what remains of the Maoist indie conspiracy, you'd like him. Now, Simply Red – which was long more of a brand than a proper group – are no more, but I glimpsed Hucknall on breakfast TV the other day, promoting a rather workmanlike single called Happy This Christmas, and looking like either the years of moneyed indulgence had finally caught up with him, or he doesn't do mornings (or both). But his voice was as great as ever: all nuance and warmth, with his customary intuitive grasp of his subject matter – whether it's Christmas, or the imperative to ""get on top more"".",Here's to Mick Hucknall's amazing voice | John Harris,2011-12-21T07:59:00Z,John Harris,uk
"Many years ago I accidentally put a tax invoice into my May file instead of the previous March, thus missing the relevant tax year. When the discrepancy emerged, an Inland Revenue inspector said he would ""let me off"" with no more than the tax, the interest and, as I recall, a £1,000 fine. After reading today's Commons report on tax avoidance, I realise my mistake. I should have told the inspector I worked for Goldman Sachs, invited him to Le Gavroche and suggested a hundred quid would settle the business, plus a partnership when he retired. It is the old story. When you owe the Revenue a thousand pounds you have a problem. When you owe it a billion pounds, the revenue has a problem, but also a solution. In good times such stories merely water the envious eye. In bad times they induce blind rage. Why the hell should people be expected to lose their jobs, their houses, their lifestyles, when the government is a soft touch for the rich and powerful? This is not a matter of left or right, socialist or capitalist. Britons are now embarking on a journey into a dark night of economic gloom. Nothing will make them less inclined to co-operate than the sight of a lucky few rowing to safety in gold-plated lifeboats. The coalition government has made a wholly justified attempt at fairness in certain areas of its spending. Those on phoney sickness benefit should not take money from those in honest work. Those on public salaries should not enjoy pension rights beyond the dreams of those in the private sector. Those who choose large families should not live subsidised in smart houses at the expense of those who cannot afford such places. But fairness cuts both ways. Today's report on the tax leniency shown by the Revenue towards big corporations indicates that toughness towards the poor is not replicated by toughness towards the rich. The estimate was of some £25bn in taxes gone missing, the bulk of it concealed by an insistence on ""commercial confidentiality"", otherwise known as incompetent secrecy. Goldman Sachs appeared to have paid £20m less than it should on bonuses alone, and was excused with a £10m payment ex gratia and a ""handshake"" with the boss of the Revenue. Vodaphone paid just £1.25bn towards a tax bill that should have been some £6bn. The reasonable assumption is that these cases were tips of an iceberg. Meanwhile the relevant inspectors were being wined, dined and offered jobs by the grandees of the accountancy firms overseeing the scams. This government, so draconian towards spending in public, is proving as casual towards dodgy money in private as were Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Earlier this month the Olympics boss, Lord Coe, moseyed into Downing Street and said that his opening and closing ceremonies were looking a bit mean at £40m. Could he double it to £81m for more tinsel? Rather than scream and kick him downstairs, David Cameron said: my dear chap, but of course. I wonder what the prime minister would have said if his lordship had been asking for a care home, a library or a clinic. Much of the trouble comes down to the inexperience of ingenue ministers, and their susceptibility to the pestilence of lobbying now infecting Westminster. On this occasion the hapless Olympics minister, Hugh Robertson, claimed that the extra £41m was ""worth £2-5bn in advertising revenue alone"", a rate of return so fanciful as to suggest a lobbyist's lunch beyond all imagining. Robertson also claimed to need another £271m for games security (not to mention 10,000 troops, warships and surface-to-air missiles), despite it being ""not in response to any specific security threat"". It was just money. This was merely the climax of naivety. In their first month in office, ministers were told – and believed – that it would be ""more expensive"" to cancel two new aircraft carriers than to build them. Ministers were told it would cost £2bn to cancel Labour's crazy NHS computer rather than dump it in the nearest skip. Chris Huhne, darling of the renewables industry, wants to give it £8bn a year to rescue the planet, one of the quickest ways of transferring money from poor consumer to rich landowner yet found. The chancellor, George Osborne, was told by lobbyists he could save £3bn a year by giving away commercial planning permissions. All this was statistical rubbish. If local government behaved as credulously as Whitehall it would be summoned before the audit commission and subject to surcharge. When ministers pay out such sums it is ""in the national interest"", and the Treasury and national audit office nod in sage agreement. It may be a corny adage, but it remains glaring that almost no holder of high office in Britain at present has ever met a payroll, run a business or cut a corporate budget. They are children playing with sweets. Osborne is the scourge of public sector unions and condemns tax avoidance, yet he refuses to end the scandal of crown tax havens, from Jersey to the Caymans, that enjoy the benefits of British citizenship while enabling individuals and corporations to evade British tax. Last week the European Union lectured Britain on financial regulation, while harbouring on its borders such fiscal black holes as Monaco, Liechtenstein and Switzerland. The thesis, accepted by governments of all parties, that the rich should be allowed to escape tax for their ""wealth-creating potential"" has surely been exploded by the credit crunch. It is not the kind of wealth Britain can afford. If Goldman Sachs dislikes paying British taxes it should go to Dubai, not just the first-class lounge at Heathrow. The control of public expenditure is never perfectly equitable. It is war by other means. But when large sections of the public are being asked to bear the burden of cuts in their standard of living – largely through the action and inaction of government – they are entitled to see at least a semblance of fair play. Just because lobbyists say bonuses and tax havens are ""essential to Britain's recovery"" does not mean they are. The government's tolerance of both is more than stupid. It induces cynicism in the public realm and recruits fair-minded people to the cause of St Paul's protesters and public sector strikers. Nothing is more crucial to national wellbeing at a time like this than a sense of equality of misery. The British government derides Greece and Italy as countries where taxpaying is ""voluntary"". It appears to be voluntary in Britain too.","The government is so draconian, yet so casual towards dodgy private cash | Simon Jenkins",2011-12-20T21:00:02Z,Simon Jenkins,politics
"Has there ever been a better time to be a geek? Even before physicists arranged for the God particle to reveal itself at Christmas, the late Steve Jobs had proved that brainiacs can become universally loved and Brian Cox had been named in People magazine's list of ""sexiest men in the world"". In The Social Network, much homelier geeks become insanely rich and thus, although they remain homely, desired by beautiful women. Dr Alex Hoffman, the reclusive Cern alumnus at the centre of Robert Harris's terrific new thriller, The Fear Index, finds himself, accompanied by great wealth and a captivating wife, the master of the global financial markets and of their horrible clients. He is not at all normal, but as one character says, quoting Clinton: ""Normalcy is overrated: most normal people are assholes."" For a person like Ed Miliband, circumstances could hardly have been more propitious. Or they might have been, had he stuck to honest geekdom. Instead, his supporters have boasted that he ""speaks human"", a comment that, if sincere, surely tells you more about them than him. What next for Westminster primacy: a signing chimp? Moreover, if it was true, why the incessant making-over? Miliband has been dressed up in normal-looking clothes, made to have a normal marriage and to drink a normal pint in a pub, operated on to give him a normal voice, and given a normal book to read: One Day. He would have done better to study another landmark in the history of geek acceptance, Channel 4's The Big Bang Theory. The star of this popular replacement for Friends is a character called Sheldon, an emotionally illiterate particle physicist with an IQ of 187. Along with his physics genius buddies, the fictional Sheldon, famous for going to a fancy dress party as the Doppler effect, is credited with a surge in the number of actual British physics students. He is also a walking masterclass in crushing put-downs to bigger, handsomer, stupider people. If his cult status indicates potential public tolerance for clever people who combine abnormality and zero social skills with a dismaying lack of humility there seems to be no reason why Mr Milband should not have made his mark. Nobody has asked him to dress, like Sheldon, as the change in frequency of a wave for an observer moving relative to the wave. Just making David Cameron look insupportably smug and arrogant would be a success, at this stage. But last week's polls, showing growing dissatisfaction with Miliband's leadership, accompanied by another disastrous Commons performance, establish that this tragic experiment has failed. Not only does speaking human still elude the younger Miliband, he struggles, as photographs of his strange expressions cruelly illustrate, to master standard non-verbal communication. With unemployment figures at hideous levels after the chancellor's dire autumn statement, the Tories find themselves overtaking a party led by a man whom the public consider inferior, in almost all departments, to its Etonian. Failing, as per, to make any impression on a PMQs at which he should at least have embarrassed Cameron for notching up both enemies and neets, Miliband showed that the public have got him right. Even after 15 months of practice, with some decent gags prepared, he still lacks the charm and poise to prevail on Cameron's terms and, what is more devastating, the ideas and intellectual equipment to triumph on his own. Every week, thanks to this asymmetrical double act, shallowness wins the day. Reviewing this excruciating encounter, which featured one of Cameron's favourite taunts, ""it's not like we're brothers or anything"", some concluded that Miliband's fratricide made him eternally vulnerable. The truth, surely, is that any evidence of superior ability and vision on Miliband's part could have vindicated his ruthlessness to a brother we never much liked anyway. Instead, the polls – and any appearance by D Miliband – repeatedly suggest that he destroyed the senior geek for nothing. Fourteen months since Ed's victory, courtesy of unions he recently counselled not to strike, have not been long enough for him to identify beliefs to which he alluded in his victory speech, as running ""through everything I do"". Whatever these mysterious convictions may be, they could not be better applied at this stage than to organising his replacement by Yvette Cooper, the Labour party's only conceivable solution to David Cameron. For her part, the timing might be no better now than it was in 2010, when she said her children were too young to make such a commitment. But for now, there is no other contender. Electoral humiliation already looms and if she waits too long, the much-hyped Chuka Umunna will come along and Labour still won't have its first woman leader. Is it impertinent to suggest that Mr Balls, considering his recent contributions to the economic debate, might be more useful at home, where he could also find more time to weep in front of Antiques Roadshow and One Man and His Dog, to name just some of his appointment TV? If she is any kind of patriot, Cooper hardly has a choice. You do not have to be a Labour supporter to cringe at debates, at a time of economic extremis, in which Cameron's wee jest, about Labour wanting a new leader for Christmas passes for some Churchillian gem. As demonstrated in her conference speech, Today interviews and demolition of Theresa May during their great borders stand-off, Cooper is more fluent than Miliband and more plausible than her husband, but even without opening her mouth, her presence alone would be a huge, possibly insurmountable obstacle to Cameron's ad hominem attacks. True, the Ballses extracted some tremendous expenses, by way of house-flipping – but is that a failing on which the wisteria-clearing Cameron, employer of fellow-flippers, would want to focus? Unable to taunt and scoff at her in Flashman style, or to patronise her, using his ""calm down dear""/""lady's frustration"" mode, what would be Cameron's tactics for crushing an equally intelligent, unimpressed woman whose weakest personal spot is her husband's contribution to the debt crisis? Given that any hint of sexism would, instantaneously aggravate his own most glaring problem that of systematically alienating women? Certainly, a degree of humourlessness, noted even by Cooper's sympathisers, could if unchecked be turned to Cameron's and hostile sketchwriters' advantage. Won't she ever lighten up? Reassuringly, for those fearing another ""speaks human"" calamity, she appears to repress warmth, rather than actually require a transplant. A look at Cooper's pre-1997 Independent columns, before she was suddenly selected for Castleford, confirms that she did indeed write in approachable human, even about economics. Among other themes to exercise her were educational unfairness, callous misconceptions about ME (from which she temporarily suffered), relations between the sexes and idiotic statements about youthful political disenchantment. ""Why vote when you could be snogging?"" she asked. ""Politics isn't cool and it isn't sexy."" Nonetheless, one might argue, it urgently deserves something better than Ed Miliband.","Oh, Ed.

"Christopher Hitchens was a pain in the neck. When I last debated with him it was in New York. He stumbled late on stage to draw attention to himself, cigarette and drink in hand, uttering oaths like a prohibition hack. The identikit Trot of our early friendship had became a rabid Bushite defending the Iraq war. He demanded to know how I could love Saddam Hussein so much as to oppose a war against him. I thought he was either in the pay of the Kurds, or had undergone an apotheosis into the ranks of the great American intellectual, a fraternity whose members must spin ideology on a dime and flip a dozen epigrams a night on TV. I respected Hitchens – or at least the American version – for two sterling qualities. He was fearless in his attacks, and he developed into a stylist of columnar baroque. His mastery of the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations was devastating. Why abuse an opponent when you can get Dr Johnson to do it for you? Who cares if you change opinions more often than a shirt, provided the audience gasps? Why bother what you say, as long as you pay your dues at the hallowed shrine of the English language? Hitchens seemed deliberately to choose enemies who could answer back, such as Henry Kissinger, the Clintons, Mother Teresa and Gore Vidal, while his friends could not, such as Jefferson, Paine and Orwell. In an age when opinion is customarily terse and glib, Hitchens was Georgian and orotund. His odyssey from International Socialism to Vanity Fair, from opposing the Vietnam war to loving the Iraq one, was accompanied by a shameless self-confidence and a fusillade of justificatory references. The truth is that amid the noisome banality of wall-to-wall news, strong opinion and passionate conviction expressed in grammatical prose can still draw the crowds. The most encouraging thing about the public realm is that Hitchens could be so phenomenally popular. When last month Intelligence Squared staged a down-the-line interview with Hitchens at the Royal Festival Hall, compered by Stephen Fry, they wondered if anyone would come. When Hitchens proved too ill to do more than text his replies, they feared a flop. The hall was sold out. Not many journalists could do that, even with the help of such friends and admirers as Richard Dawkins, Martin Amis, Salman Rushdie, Sean Penn and others. The caricature tales of drinking, womanising and U-turning were familiar enough, but what clear was something else, a widespread appreciation of a free spirit that owed nothing to anything but its own turbulent thought processes.",Christopher Hitchens: a fearless master-stylist and a pain in the neck | Simon Jenkins,2011-12-16T13:35:13Z,Simon Jenkins,world
"A website called studentbeans.com has come up with the cheapest possible Christmas dinner – and just as an aside, it amuses me (in a grim way) how students are the acceptable face of economy food. Students and chemists: cast your mind back to the toast sandwich. That only made it on to BBC Radio 4's Today programme because it was an intellectual exercise, experimenting with maximum satiation for minimum cost, rather than a desperate one. If you were a website called incrediblypoorfamily.com, you would be shouting your money-saving tips into the void. But anyway, here it is: Christmas weighs in at £1.90 a head, although you have to be prepared to substitute a roast potato for a waffle – which, if you ask me, is so tenuous that you might as well swap the whole lot for spaghetti hoops and bring it in for under a quid. The turkey is actually wafer-thin turkey ham, which I must admit, I love: it is so salty that it's like a slice of pure salt that reminds you of meat. Now, the cost of a real Christmas dinner has been ramped up by the ceremony. Like weddings, Christmas exists in its own behavioural economic heat-island. The prices relate not to the items themselves but to the sense that, on this special occasion, everything must cost an outlandishly special amount. In short, that ratio of cheapest to most expensive home-cooked Christmas meal, which is probably 1:20, would not be replicated in normal life, where the ratio is probably more like 1:7. Nevertheless, there is a widespread underestimation, or blank refusal to admit, how much cheaper cheap food really is. It became a mantra of the mainstream, as obesity started to define the pathology of this century, that the problem was not poverty, it was education. This was based on two facts. The first was that everybody, except affluent women, was getting fatter. So it couldn't be related to poverty, since it was hitting upper-middle class men. The second was that an organic vegetable box would always be cheaper than a pack of Findus Crispy pancakes; therefore the more healthily you ate, the less you would spend. And I saw plenty of counter-arguments to that, identifying poor eating habits as a result of deprivation. One was that people with kids and very little money can't afford to waste food, so have to buy things that children are likely to eat, which more or less means food with too much salt and not enough fresh vegetation. Another was that people battling food scarcity tend to overeat when food is available, and depending on what they're overeating, a missed meal the next day won't compensate for that. Both of those propositions make sense, but I rarely heard people say, just look at the phenomenal value for money, calories-per-penny in a McDonald's. It blows your mind how cheap a £1 cheeseburger is; crisps are even cheaper. Cheap foods are fatty, and the whole point of fat is satiety. If you look at fresh vegetables in the old-fashioned way, as fuel, rather than the modern way, as an embodiment of morality and self-governance, they are terrible value, especially the organic ones. In the noughties, while this was simply the backdrop to a conversation about obesity, it didn't seem to matter that the dimension of cost was so frequently refuted. Now, however, the price of food is more likely to crop up in a conversation about inflation, or child poverty, or households in which there is a regular winter choice between heating and eating. I heard a grandmother on Radio 4's PM some months ago saying that, for those five weeks of snow last winter, she had fed her grandchildren (of whom she had sole care) nothing but eggs, beans, chips and toast. I've lost count of the number of rows I've had about that, many in public, one live on telly, during which the broadcaster Jonathan Maitland said this was a problem of education: if she knew how to shop better she would have been able to afford a more balanced diet. This is total tripe (which, although famously cheap because it is famously disgusting, is still probably more expensive than a Big Mac); certainly, you could shop differently with the same money and win the approval of nutritionist Gillian McKeith, but if your aim is to avoid being hungry, you could not do that more cheaply. I understand this strenuous avoidance of reality. Once you accept that crap food is an economic, not a moral choice, you have to accept a whole raft of unpleasant outcomes as a function of deprivation, not an illustration of a lack of backbone. You have to accept that 24,000 ""lifestyle-related"" yearly deaths from diabetes are related not to sloth but to poverty. Sure, it's still a lifestyle, but it's not a choice. You have to accept that the education agenda against obesity – vegetables and regular exercise – will never work (that should be obvious, just by looking at the data or, failing that, just by looking around). I think there's an element of projection here, where people who can afford to eat well – and do – still secretly yearn for a Big Mac, and it's their own yearning rather than political deliberation that makes them think they're looking at a lack of willpower from the McDonald's classes. But this has nothing to do with willpower.","Obesity is about poverty and cheap food, not a lack of moral fibre | Zoe Williams",2011-12-14T21:30:02Z,Zoe Williams,society

"Whoever wrote the political rulebook needs to start rewriting it. It used to be an iron maxim that voters' most vital organ was neither their head nor their heart, but their wallet. If they were suffering economically, they'd throw the incumbents out. Yet in Britain a coalition presiding over barely-there growth, rising unemployment and forecasts of gloom stretching to the horizon is holding steady in the opinion polls, while in the US Barack Obama is mired in horrible numbers – except for the ones showing him beating all-comers in the election now less than 11 months away. Even though the US economy is slumped in the doldrums, some of the country's shrewdest commentators make a serious case that Obama could be heading for a landslide victory in 2012. How to explain such a turnaround? In the United States, at least, there is one compellingly simple, two-word answer: Fox News. By any normal standards, Obama should be extremely vulnerable. Not only is the economy in bad shape, he has proved to be a much more hesitant, less commanding White House presence than his supporters longed for. And yet, most surveys put him comfortably ahead of his would-be rivals. That's not a positive judgment on the president – whose approval rating stands at a meagre 44% – but an indictment of the dire quality of a Republican field almost comically packed with the scandal-plagued, gaffe-prone and downright flaky. And the finger of blame for this state of affairs points squarely at the studios of Fox News. It's not just usual-suspect lefties and professional Murdoch-haters who say it, mischievously exaggerating the cable TV network's influence. Dick Morris, veteran political operative and Fox regular, noted the phenomenon himself the other day while sitting on the Fox sofa. ""This is a phenomenon of this year's election,"" he said. ""You don't win Iowa in Iowa. You win it on this couch. You win it on Fox News."" In other words, it is Fox – with the largest cable news audience, representing a huge chunk of the Republican base – that is, in effect, picking the party's nominee to face Obama next November. This doesn't work crudely – not that crudely, anyway. Roger Ailes, the Fox boss, does not deliver a newspaper-style endorsement of a single, anointed candidate. Rather, some are put in the sunlight, and others left to moulder in the shade. The Media Matters organisation keeps tabs on what it calls the Fox Primary, measuring by the minute who gets the most airtime. It has charted a striking correlation, with an increase in a candidate's Fox appearances regularly followed by a surge in the opinion polls. Herman Cain and Rick Perry both benefited from that Fox effect, with Newt Gingrich, the former House Speaker, the latest: in the days before he broke from the pack, Gingrich topped the Fox airtime chart. Meanwhile, Mitt Romney cannot seem to break through a 20-to-25% ceiling in the polls – hardly surprising considering, as the league table shows, he has never been a Fox favourite. But it works in a subtler way than the mere degree of exposure. Fox, serving up constant outrage and fury, favours bluster over policy coherence. Its ideal contributor is a motormouth not a wonk, someone who makes good TV rather than good policy. Little wonder it fell for Cain and is swooning now for Gingrich – one of whom has never held elected office while the other messed up when he did, but who can talk and talk – while it has little interest in Romney and even less in Jon Huntsman, even though both have impressive records as state governors. The self-described conservative journalist Andrew Sullivan says that the dominant public figures on the right are no longer serving politicians, but ""provocative, polarising media stars"" who serve up enough controversy and conflict to keep the ratings high. ""In that atmosphere, you need talk-show hosts as president, not governors or legislators."" Fox News and what Sullivan calls the wider ""Media Industrial Complex"" have not only determined the style of the viable Republican presidential candidate, but the content too. If one is to flourish rather than wither in the Fox spotlight, there are several articles of faith to which one must subscribe – from refusing to believe in human-made climate change, and insisting that Christians are an embattled minority in the US, persecuted by a liberal, secular, bi-coastal elite, to believing that government regulation is always wrong, and that any attempt to tax the wealthiest people is immoral. Those who deviate are rapidly branded foreign, socialist or otherwise un-American. Some wonder if it was fear of this ultra-conservative catechism that pushed a series of Republican heavyweights to sit out 2012. ""The talent pool got constricted,"" says David Frum, the former George W Bush speechwriter who has been boldest in speaking out against the Foxification of his party. Fox sets a series of litmus tests that not every Republican can or wants to pass. This affects those who run as well as those who step aside, setting the parameters within which a Republican candidate must operate. What troubles Frum is that it pushes Republicans to adopt positions that will make them far less appealing to the national electorate in November, with Romney's forced march rightward typical. Even if Romney somehow wins the nomination, he won't be ""the pragmatic, problem-solving Mitt Romney"" of yore, says Frum, but a new Foxified version. It was this process that led the former speechwriter to declare last year: ""Republicans originally thought that Fox worked for us – and now we're discovering we work for Fox."" So far, so bad for the Republicans. Why should anyone else care? Because the Fox insistence on unbending ideological correctness turns every compromise – a necessary staple of governance – into an act of treachery. The Republican refusal, cheered on by a Fox News chorus, to raise the US debt ceiling this summer, thereby prompting the downgrading of America's credit rating, is only the most vivid example. The larger pattern is one of stubborn, forced gridlock, paralysing the republic even now, at a moment of global economic crisis. The problem is compounded by a wilful blindness towards the facts. Ari Rabin-Havt of Media Matters says Fox has created a ""post-truth politics"", which is happy to ignore and distort basic empirical evidence. To take one example, Fox pundits constantly repeat that ""53% of Americans pay all the tax"". In fact, 53% pay all the federal income tax – but many, many more pay so-called payroll taxes. It's hard for a nation to make the right policy decisions if the public is misled on the basic facts. And misled they certainly are. A series of surveys has proven that Fox viewers are woefully ignorant of current affairs, the latest study revealing that it is actually better to consume no news than to watch Fox: you end up better informed. The extremism, anger, paranoia and sense of victimhood that Fox incubates are all unhealthy for the United States. But it's inflicting particular damage on the Republican party, which could well lose a winnable election because of its supine relationship to a TV network. It turns out it is not liberals who should fear the Fox – it's conservatives.",How Fox News is helping Barack Obama's re-election bid | Jonathan Freedland,2011-12-13T21:00:00Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"What if Niall Ferguson had not declared war on Pankaj Mishra in 2011? As Ferguson argues in his book Virtual History: ""It makes sense to compare the actual outcomes of what we did in the past with the conceivable outcomes of what we might have done."" Thus counterfactualists may want to ask how things might stand had Ferguson not chosen to respond with escalating legal threats to Mishra's unfavourable review of Civilization in the London Review of Books. Mishra had made comparisons with work by the American white supremacist writer Theodore Lothrop Stoddard, which Ferguson chose to interpret as a libellous accusation of racism: ""At the very least, Mishra owes me a public apology for his highly offensive and defamatory allegation."" He also expressed anger, in a style perhaps more reminiscent of Charles Pooter than Stoddard, at being described as ""immune to… humour and irony"" (generously, no formal apology was demanded for this additional affront). Now, Mishra's responses only having further inflamed him, Ferguson is threatening the LRB's editor with litigation, telling her, he discloses: ""Don't force my hand by forcing me to put it in the hands of lawyers."" Did it have to be this way? Imagine the outcome if Ferguson had contented himself, as countless indignant academics have done in the past, with letters, bitterly addressing Mishra's wrongness as he sees it. That would have been nothing out of the ordinary for a journal which has hosted livelier engagements, or for Ferguson, who would thereby have retained his place in the celebrity firmament as the brilliant telly historian with, by his own admission, a huge talent for grudges. ""Get the bastard when the opportunity arises,"" is a scholarly precept he shared recently with Decca Aitkenhead. ""Never underestimate the irate Professor Ferguson."" Although he began his first letter of protest to the LRB: ""It is not my habit to reply to hostile reviews"", this self-restraint is not uniform. A Guardian article by Seumas Milne was described as ""a shocking piece of crass misrepresentation"". Occasionally, the never-to-be-underestimated Ferguson prefers to pursue his vendettas on ICorrect, a site where fellow celebrities such as Cherie Blair and Naomi Campbell pay $10,000 for the chance to rebut false accusations. Sir Michael Caine, for instance, has used ICorrect to record that he never said: ""Not many people know that."" For his part, Ferguson insists that he, in fact, won a debate with another of his intellectual opponents, the economist Paul Krugman, quoting in his own support a headline from a Korean newspaper: ""A great Nobel prize winner humiliated like a dog in Korea"". A subsequent entry dismisses a hostile review of Civilization by another critic, Alex von Tunzelmann. ""This critique would be more impressive,"" says Ferguson, clearly floundering without his Korean supporters, ""if von Tunzelmann had bothered to read the book."" What if Ferguson had, rather than threaten Mishra with libel, registered his objections, as in the past, in Naomi Campbell's journal of record? Most general readers, as well as most historians, would have remained unaware that he frequents this preposterous website and his judgment would not have risked, as a result, becoming a matter for contemptuous speculation (assuming, of course, the ICorrect entries do not illustrate a well-developed sense of humour and irony). Is Ferguson's recourse to libel threats, as some believe, just another way of advertising his book? If increased sales do not ensue, the unfolding drama is sure to remind a lot of people how recently he urged US neocons to build a new empire. Indeed – although his formidable energy can make it hard to keep up – I understand he was still endorsing the export of western freedom by force at around the time Michael Gove adopted him as a history mentor, tasked with transforming flabby thematic teaching into something closer to Our Island Story. As Sir Michael Caine once said, not many people know that. As for the impact of his actions on historians in general, it could be argued that, even without Ferguson's contribution, his profession had already been lavishly embarrassed by David Starkey on Jamie's Dream School, and by the extraordinary activities of Orlando Figes, who was last year unveiled as the author of abject attacks on his rivals, stealthily posted on Amazon. Now, clearly, a hack is in no position to criticise a historian or not until it is revealed that a historian once did something as vile as put a letter in JK Rowling's daughter's school bag. But when Gove is extolling history's prime role in helping students ""separate falsities from the truth"", it cannot help this argument that Figes remains Professor of Sockpuppetry (and History) at Birkbeck, University of London. What was unforgivable about Figes, the author of The Whisperers: Private Life in Stalin's Russia, and excruciating for his targets, fellow academics who feared being ruined, was his threat of libel action, to close down questions about his activities. After Figes was exposed (following an unsuccessful attempt to attribute the attacks to his wife), one victim, the great historian Robert Service, wrote: ""The public interest in this squalid little story is that if someone is wealthy and malicious enough it is possible to tread on the throat of free and open discussion in this country almost with impunity. I was close to caving in at times simply because I lacked Figes's financial resources."" Aside from its prattish appeal and Ferguson's official role, i/c Our Island Story, the public interest in his behaviour is the same. Although habitually dismissive of the UK, this US resident can still enjoy something uniquely British and precious that is unavailable in his adopted home: libel laws that allow the wealthy and vengeful to censor public discourse. A high-profile campaign for reform has not halted a procession of libel actions, by both tourists and homegrown censors, designed to silence authors and publishers. A judge is currently considering a libel action against a contributor to the Richard Dawkins website, the Richard Dawkins Foundation, and Amazon, brought by a self-published author. As with Figes, that chronicler of mute oppression turned would-be oppressor, Ferguson's earlier incarnation, as a champion of free expression, only aggravates the spectacle of him now trying to stifle it, for no better reason than pique. ""We've got to be able to talk about this stuff,"" he said of David Starkey's recent musings on the race aspects of the riots when they were attacked by some Unison-minded speech police as unsayable. It would be small consolation, in the event he got anywhere with his attack on the LRB, that the only reputation to suffer would be that of Professor Niall Ferguson, who once called a column ""a designated free-speech area"". Nowadays, he likes to extol his wife, Ayaan Hirsi Ali's superior appreciation of western liberties. ""We take freedom for granted,"" he has said, ""and because of this we don't understand how incredibly vulnerable it is."" Maybe it's beginning to dawn.",Why on earth is the history man being quite so hysterical? | Catherine Bennett,2011-12-04T00:06:41Z,Catherine Bennett,uk
"I've lost count of the times I've called for Jeremy Clarkson to be shot. I only meant it seriously on about 95% of them, and I never imagined doing it in front of his family. But if that's the way Jeremy thinks these things ought to happen, I'm humane enough to take last requests. In the meantime, late-capitalist dreamweavers continue their mission to divide the world into people who will call the BBC to complain that Jonathan Ross should be sacked, and people who will call the BBC to complain that Jeremy Clarkson should be sacked. But I would like to think there is a vast third category that finds our national sport of taking offence to be the last word in plonkery. In as few words as possible, I wish to place myself in the last section. I support the freedom to make jokes, even if they're bad, and even if they're the most hackneyed rehash of all your other bad jokes – even if you've basically only got one joke. As anyone remotely familiar with what we'll euphemise as ""my work"" would surely have guessed. That dealt with, I suppose we need to talk about Jeremy, despite all his rows being designed to prove the adage: ""Never fight with a pig. Everyone gets dirty, but the pig likes it."" As you'll have heard, the Top Gear presenter joshed on Wednesday's The One Show that all strikers should be shot in front of their families, and moaned about suicides making his trains late or something. He's flogging his new DVD – Crash! Bang! Wallop! What a Video! – so is touring the studios in his pose as the nation's foremost rebel. I know what you're thinking: Christmas DVDs, promotional tours, robotically confected controversy … none of these really feel like the answer to the question: ""What would Spartacus do?"" And you would of course be right. As only the terminally clueless will have failed to spot, Jeremy Clarkson works for ""The Man"". He doesn't live off the grid in some revolutionary base camp. He lives in Chipping Norton. He plays tennis with the prime minister. I won't spell out for you precisely what he does to The Man – imagine if children were reading – but maybe one day he'll bring out a range of Clarkson-branded kneepads. Furthermore, a huge whack of his income comes from Rupert Murdoch. Has he been contacted by Operation Weeting? If he has, he hasn't been rebellious enough to say. And if he hasn't, it is likely to be only a matter of time. Yet even if the phone-hacking allegations were to spread to his employers the Sun, my bet is Jeremy wouldn't resign in disgust at the intrusion on his personage. He has a lucrative ability to hold two contradictory positions in his mind at the same time – and in this, he is quite the man for our times. Indeed, since inequality is much in people's minds, we might observe that there are two kinds of jokes about incitement to violence. There's the kind you make on The One Show, which sells your DVD, and there's the kind you make on your obscure little Facebook page that gets you a four-year sentence, as happened during the summer unrest with a pair in Northwich who didn't even turn up to their own ""riot"" (nor did anybody except the police). Or perhaps you prefer the chap convicted for a joke tweet about Doncaster airport. Yes, there are two kinds of jokes, just as there are two kinds of marijuana. There's the pot that presidential hopefuls admit to having smoked in a youthful-experiment-type way, and there's the pot criminals currently serving life sentences under preposterous three strikes legislation were caught with. Consider dear old Dubya Bush, whose unpunished frat boy toking was no impediment to Texas becoming the US state that prosecutes more of its citizens for marijuana than any other. Or, for balance, consider instead Bill Clinton, who ""never inhaled"", but blithely instituted a ""one strike and you're out"" policy, which saw entire families thrown out of social housing because one member (frequently a teenage child) had been busted for marijuana possession. Two kinds of marijuana, and two kinds of dumb joke. And the one thing you'll never find is the person who smoked the ""good"" kind of weed defending the type who smoked the ""bad"", just as you won't find Jeremy defending any Facebook or Twitter users' right to make offensive jokes in any of his columns. His whinge in the column following the sentencing of the Facebook fools concerned the Notting Hill carnival (he's got a flat there). It would be wrong to brand Jeremy a rebel without a cause – but his only cause is himself. He only gives a toss about things that directly affect him, and exists as our very contained, very well-paid version of the Tea Party. Meanwhile, those who spent Thursday watching the news instead of phoning the BBC will have absorbed the dire warnings for us all from the Bank of England's governor, Mervyn King, and judged that there were immeasurably more important things to worry about.

"Where is your post-digital presence? What is on your techno-horizon? Don't tell me you are still putting e- and i- in front of your product or talking ""platforms"", like some noughties nerd. That is so yesterday. Ever since I was spectacularly wrong about the internet I have fought shy of futurology. I cringe to recall that in the mid-90s I dismissed it as a technological flash in the pan, like the fax and citizen-band radio. I said it would be of use chiefly to pornographers and lawyers, and ""unlikely to have widespread application"". As for threatening books or newspapers, that was ridiculous. This was all before the dotcom boom and 3G. I had yet to surf silicon valley or move beyond a ""word processor"". This time I shall not make the same mistake. A week in California and a finger in the recessionary wind has shown me where the smart money is moving. It is from online towards ""live experience"". The example of the music business is already well-known. Earnings from recordings have been plummeting for a decade, while from live they are rising ever faster. Warner Brothers release albums free online to publicise forthcoming concerts. In Britain HMV is closing 40 shops while tickets for a Rihanna concert can cost £330, and for Coldplay £180. A seat for Madonna is more expensive than her entire recorded output. A top American performer would reckon to earn between 80% and 90% of revenue from live performance. In the US alone, touring revenue that grossed $1bn in 1995 rose to $4.6bn last year. The big money, goes the catchphrase, ""is now at the gate"". Nor is this just a youth phenomenon. On the American music circuit, 96% of singers were reportedly over 40 and almost half were over 60. The potency of experience extends far beyond the realm of music. The upsurge in live comedy began in the mid-90s with tours by Robert Newman and David Baddiel, but now has Michael McIntyre and others appearing weekly, with back-up teams that would staff a circus. Performers such as Stephen Fry have taken to reading their books in public, Dickens-style, and simulcasting to hundreds of local cinemas. Close to a million people worldwide watch the Met Opera live in cinemas. The most carefully researched audience activity, American politics, has swung from advertising and staged events to the archaic political form of active debate. The Republican primary campaign has seen 23 debates, winning unprecedented television audiences of 5-6 million. The public seems to crave the authenticity and unpredictability of ""reality politics"", with political meetings crammed to bursting. This is why Tony Blair can (or could) charge £100,000 for a speech ""in the flesh"". It is why lectures and debates are the smartest evenings in town, and why venues such as the Royal Society of Arts and the RGS are booked solid – inconceivable 20 years ago. The related cult of authenticity sees museums and galleries doubling attendances over the past decade. Visits to charging museums, such as the Louvre and New York's Metropolitan, are growing every bit as fast as the non-charging British Museum and National Gallery. The RSC and the National Theatre now play to over 90% capacity. Even humble authors find appearances at literary festivals (those that pay) can compensate for dwindling book advances and, in the case of poets, eroding copyrights. The new magnetism of congregation seems universal. Every online service or forum promotes an event, an invitation, a club night, something for which subscribers will pay, much as online dating points towards a meeting. Demonstrators are never content with online but want to ""seize back the streets"". Religious sites plead for church attendance. Courses plead for students to go to colleges. Never have coffee bars been more popular, with Starbucks this week announcing another 300 with 5,000 staff to be employed. Anything for a bit of buzz. There are as many theories as there are pundits on what this means. It is possible that people who spend all day online yearn to escape a screen at evenings and weekends, which explains why television has lost its pull. The silicon valley guru, Nicholas Carr, has written of the ""shallowing"" of the brain under the influence of too much computing, as we evolve from being ""cultivators of personal knowledge to being hunter/gatherers in the electronic forest"". Some therapists are even advising slow computer apps, to stop mental burn-out. The urbanist William Mitchell's Etopia ponders the ""different grades of presence"" that the internet offers, but concludes that a yearning for location and experience characterises even the online city. Ultimately ""we want to be where it is"" in person. A mild sensation was created this summer by the revelation that Google, Apple and Yahoo executives were sending their children to California's Waldorf schools, where computers are banned. The masters of the e-universe appear convinced that computers ""reduce attention spans and inhibit creative thinking, movement and human interaction"". Classes have reverted to using blackboards, chalk, pens, paper, books and even teachers. Post-digital is not anti-digital. It extends digital into the beyond. The web becomes not a destination in itself but a route map to somewhere real. In Marshall McLuhan's terminology, it is cold where live is hot. This is why concerts did not die with the invention of records, but thrived on the difference. The screen relieves loneliness, as once did letters and phones, but it remains a window on the world, not a door. You cannot download the thunderous beat and sweaty presence of thousands at a Lady Gaga concert, any more than you can make love on Facebook, much as some try. You have to go somewhere for it to happen. I find this return to civility exhilarating not from any animus against technology. I do not buy Carr's thesis that the internet is somehow scrambling our brains, that we are losing the ability to read long sentences or handle complex information critically. Too much staring at screens may be bad for eyes and backs, as neurotic fiddling with iPhones is rude to present company, but the web has been by far the most rewarding innovation of my lifetime. Futurology is a mug's game. The Economist, surveying ""e-entertainment"" back in 2000, concluded that for music ""the internet will be a hugely important source of revenue"", but that its impact on books, movies and television would be ""peripheral"". It added that ""big cheeses of the entertainment industry will quietly and collectively breathe a sigh of relief, because they never liked or understood the internet anyway"". All proved wrong. Online services have found it hard to ""monetise"" their visits. Most offer nothing but free information and waste millions of man hours garnering unremunerative hits, whereas live uses the web to market and charge for a destination. As consumer spending evolves from ""needs to wants"", from goods to experiences, the post-digital age focuses on personal contact. Post-digital is not pre-techno but exploits technology for a civilising purpose, human congregation and intercourse. The money is at the gate. This must be good news.","Welcome to the post-digital world, an exhilarating return to civility – via Facebook and Lady Gaga | Simon Jenkins",2011-12-01T21:30:00Z,Simon Jenkins,world
"Cookbooks divide into two categories, reference and lifestyle: to the first, you will turn when you're in the mood for a quiche, any quiche, or you want to know what to do with brisket; to the second, when you wish to be the sort of person who cooks that sort of thing. It sounds like I'm making a value judgment, which I'm not: some of my favourite recipes come from lifestyle cookbooks, and it's possible for some authors, mainly home cooks, to turn their hands to both (for instance, Nigella Lawson's How to Eat is a reference book, while her Forever Summer with Nigella is not). It's possible for some authors, mainly serious chefs, to produce books that are neither, but this isn't the time to start slating people. Soon it'll be Christmas. Once in a decade, probably, a book comes out that is both: that has hundreds of recipes, tested by normal people rather than other chefs, with regular rather than esoteric ingredients, but is also idiosyncratic and inventive, and could only have been written by that person. I commend to you as this rare all-rounder Dan Lepard's Short and Sweet (Fourth Estate, £25), a very generous compendium (300 recipes, maybe?) of everything you can possibly do with every possible kind of flour. His particular schtick is to recognise the things professionals do better than home cooks – how do American diners make such great cheesecake? How does a shop-bought chocolate cake get that moist crumb? Tapioca, thanks for asking. How do they make biscuits so squidgy on station concourses? – and then replicate the methods. He has plenty of his own ideas also, and a chemist's curiosity. I tried a couple of the more unusual moves – starting cupcakes with a meringue mix – and fed the resulting blueberry cakes to my mother-in-law. I saw it flit through her eyes: ""How does she bake like this, when she's not even a Christian?"" The big news for foodies was Ferran Adrià's The Family Meal (Phaidon, £19.95), in which he descends from Mount El Bulli to explain to regular people how to cook regular food. The layout is gorgeous and nostalgically arty, the recipes are arranged into 31 chic menus, but many of the photographic demos are pretty basic: accomplished maintenance cooks (that's what Italians call it when you cook all the time but only for your spouse and ungrateful children) would be miffed, I think, to be given a book in which they were shown, pictorially, how to liquidise a soup with a stick blender. Conversely, I've heard pros complain that you need quite a bit of expertise, since many of the recipes give quantities for two, four, six or eight, but don't alter the timing; you could, with insufficient experience, end up cooking three mushrooms for an hour and a half. But still, it's a big, bold monster and an adornment to the kitchen. I love the way Valentine Warner writes. He reminds me of my dad, even though I'm sure he's younger than I am; blokey, carnivorous and a bit of a show-off, he's the kind of person who bones a chicken just for kicks and thinks they sell rabbits in Costcutter. Some of the ideas in The Good Table (Mitchell Beazley, £25) are a bit cheffy; I worry about any recipe that runs over two pages and/or involves more than three animals. But at its best, this is professionalism made DIY-possible; it looks beautiful and I salute it. Lucas Hollweg's Good Things to Eat (Collins, £20) is similar in sensibility, a bit simpler and less intimidating, with a very sweet tooth (a whole chapter for peaches and plums, I ask you). There's a heap of intensely Scandinavian breakfast recipes in Signe Johansen's Scandalicious (Saltyard, £20) (a muesli for summer, a porridge for winter, and a social-inclusion programme for isolated quince), but I fell for the dinner course: four racy soups, including a zingy beetroot and ginger, and a number of piquant fish recipes. If I had any criticism, it would be a mild one, and summed up by this recipe: moose with chanterelles and lingonberry sauce. Jennifer McLagan's Odd Bits (Jacqui Small LLP, £20) was my ""oh wow"" moment; this really is a lifestyle choice, for people who want to eat, and be seen eating, pig's tails – the subtitle is How to Cook the Rest of the Animal. If you can find me a book that has more recipes for testicles … well, there isn't one. Unless Testicles for All Seasons came out and I missed it. Tongue hash, confit of gizzards, Calvados tripe: I'm telling you all this for comic effect, but I wouldn't give it shelf space if there weren't also many sensible yet unexpected recipes for the cheap and tasty end of the beast: liver, kidneys, shanks and hocks. Jamie's Great Britain (Michael Joseph, £30) looks incredibly tame by comparison, and persistent Jamie fanciers might feel that they've read a lot of this, at least in principle, before. But it has nice production values, a feelgood atmosphere, some cute, pubby ideas (smoked trout pâté with mini Yorkshire puddings – how happy would you be, if you went to someone's house and they presented that? Yes, very).

"Once upon a time, a frolicking music hack called Barbara (yes, moi) had a baby. It certainly ""smarted"", but on the whole the birth was so straightforward I went around, for ages afterwards, droning smugly about how I was ""of good working-class stock – hailing from an era when women would chuck one out, then carry on with the haymaking"". Some years later, I was in hospital, having an emergency caesarean, my five-week premature baby having to be rescued from my rubbish uterus. This time around, there was no smug droning. Just the realisation that biology, always a savage mistress, is never more random and pitiless than when it comes to childbirth, that it is more than possible for one woman to have polar opposite experiences – most importantly, that the positive outcome of one birth can mean naff all when it comes to the next time. This sprang to mind when I read about the Birthplace in England study, comparing the data for 65,000 ""low-risk"" women planning to give birth either at hospital, in a midwife-led birthing unit, or at home. First-time mothers attempting to give birth at home had almost three times the risk of serious difficulties. Who'd have thought it? A first-timer attempting to produce human life in a paddling pool in their front room, with Norah Jones on the iPod – what could possibly go wrong? The study's Professor Brocklehurst described the sort of first-time home birthers as ""white, slightly older, better educated, living in more affluent areas"". He didn't say it, or even suggest it but, to me, these sound like assertive, capable, but heartbreakingly naive women who delude themselves that because they've been a hot shot in marketing they can control the vagaries of childbirth. Dream on. Almost half of first-time mothers attempting home birth ended up in hospital due to complications during labour, but so did almost 12% of women who'd given birth before and had been judged to have ""no increased risk"". Let's get this straight: there is ""no increased risk"" until labour starts? Hmm. In the meantime, much-needed midwives are giving one-to-one attention to all of these women, a sizable percentage of whom end up in hospital anyway? What a selfish, dangerous web the home-birth lobby weaves. Ladies! Childbirth isn't a souped-up hatha yoga session – it's dangerous and you need to be safe. We must also dispel the notion that just because it goes well once, it will go well next time. What does ""low risk"" mean anyway? After all, it's not just about a woman's birthing history, it's about the child. So what if the mother has done it before; the baby hasn't. Nor has the pregnancy happened before. Ergo, each birth is a first, there is no precedent, the variables are endless and ""low-risk"" becomes meaningless nonsense. Too many women seem to view successful labours as gestational brownie points, like collecting stamps from Caffè Nero for a free cappuccino. Only in this scenario, they get the top prize of a trouble-free home birth. I'm sorry, but that's not realistic. It scares me to think that, with my history, even factoring in my increased age, I'd have probably been judged a promising ""low-risk"" candidate for a home birth for my second child. When in fact, I was a uterine Chernobyl waiting to happen. The odds are that this probably wouldn't happen to all you women out there, but guess what? It might. We mustn't kid ourselves that childbirth can ever be risk-assessed in advance. Just as every human being is different, so is every pregnancy and birth. Believe me, if it goes horribly wrong, as it did for me, you really don't want to be in your front room, lying on a beanbag, with only an ice cube to suck on. Norah Jones can only help so much. Talk about as thick as thieves  A 16-year-old repeat offender's apology letter to the people he burgled was something of a remorse-free zone. ""Dear Victim,"" he announced (henceforth all misspellings are his), before continuing: ""I don't no why I'm writing a letter to you! I have been forced to by ISSP [Intensive Supervision and Surveillance Programme]. I'm not bothered or sorry I burgled your house. Basicly it was your fault anyways."" He pointed out his victims' ""dumb mistakes"", announcing: ""I'm not going to show any sympath or remors"", signing off: ""Yours sincerly."" What a charmer. Who would not brim over with forgiveness when faced with such a missive? Still, he's clearly a bit of a wrong'un, though at least this makes a refreshing change from all those insincere letters sent by criminals in the hope that they'll get off with a lighter sentence. All that pious scrawling about how they wished they'd never made off with your DVD player and that they'd seen the error of their ways. Yeah, whatever, tea leaf. For all his faults, including the kind of spelling you usually only see on an accidentally overturned Scrabble board, at least this young gentleman isn't a hypocrite. Just a thief and a thicko and not just because of the spelling mistakes. It's sad, then, that this letter wasn't posted on to the victims of the burglary for fear of causing offence. Spoilsports. Just because people have been burgled doesn't mean that they've lost their sense of humour. The victims may have enjoyed the fact that they'd been burgled by a very special, as in particularly stupid, miscreant. The kind who, even though he's offended before and presumably knows the ropes, can't be bothered to apologise, even when it's in his own best interests. That has to be worth a stamp. Please can we say goodbye to Norma Jean? The new Marilyn Monroe biopic, My Week With Marilyn, starring Michelle Williams, is out. How tedious. For me, Monroe, along with James Dean, was only ever useful as an Athena poster litmus test – if you came across people with them on their wall, you knew they were incapable of independent thought. Monroe and Dean were ""Tragic Icons R Us"" for those without the wit to think of something more original. The same goes for any thespians citing Monroe's vulnerability as an influence. Why always vulnerability? What about courage, humour, sass? Bette Davis or Ava Gardner – the latter was such a ballbuster she made Frank Sinatra cry. If I were an actress, Glenn Close would be my role model – zipping elegantly between film and TV roles without a Norma Desmond meltdown in sight. Anyone who's really interested in Marilyn should read Joyce Carol Oates's harrowing novel, Blonde. Otherwise, be aware that Ms Monroe's cult of vulnerability is directly linked to everyone in popular culture hawking a ""Boo hoo! Poor me!"" backstory these days.

"If all the suspected celebrity victims of phone hacking were laid end to end, they'd reach from Wapping to somewhere with a more pleasant current climate. Tartarus, perhaps, or some nice nuclear exclusion zone. Yet if those celebrities who stuck their heads above the parapet to testify to Lord Justice Leveson's inquiry into press conduct this week were arranged similarly, the line would struggle to make it out of the door of the small courtroom in which Leveson is hearing evidence. In fact, I hope the small rebel army of witnesses who braved it – along with the named others who have offered to give evidence but haven't been called so far – would not object to my observing that they are not typical ""celebrities"" at all. JK Rowling is so intensely private that she is a kind of anti-celebrity (which made her stories of hounding so unimpeachably powerful), and her siblings-in-arms fell into similarly non-mainstream camps. Others insist their day in the sun (excuse the pun) is long over – Hugh Grant has described himself as ""semi-retired"" for years, while Sheryl Gascoigne is a tabloid darling from another era. Then there were those who clearly judged they had nothing left to lose. In this category we might place the McCanns, who have passed through a series of unimaginable media pain barriers, having lived through being accused variously of selling their abducted daughter and hiding her body in their freezer. Sienna Miller will know her legal pursuit of the News of the World over phone hacking would have been seen in certain corners of Fleet Street as a terminal bridge-burning, while Steve Coogan observed that the tabloids had gone to work so thoroughly on him that his closet was now empty of skeletons, conferring upon him what he tellingly described as immunity. Meanwhile, Elle Macpherson's former brand manager wasn't a celebrity at all. Her former employer announced this week she had decided to take no action whatsoever on phone hacking because ""I did not want to perpetuate stories about myself"". But if Macpherson's absence was glaring, others were even more so. Where are the big names from light entertainment? Charlotte Church will appear next week, though the erstwhile Voice of an Angel would surely concede she is no longer in her showbiz pomp. So where are the talent show judges, the stellar presenters, the breakfast anchors, the celebrity chefs, the big bucks personalities who, if you manage to speak to them, will so often tell you they are convinced they were victims of phone hacking as well as countless other forms of unjustifiable intrusion? Not only do these stars exist, but they are legion. Many have already been contacted by Operation Weeting, while others are merely waiting for the years-belated call from Scotland Yard they know will confirm it. Yet barely one is anywhere to be seen in Leveson's courtroom, nor apparently on any schedule to appear. Their absence is almost as eloquent as some of this week's witness testimony – a powerful rejoinder to those who claim that a watershed moment in the relationship between stars and the press has suddenly been reached. Why won't others go over the top? The easiest answer is fear – a fear of media reprisals that persists virtually as strongly as it ever did despite the fact of the inquiry. Sheryl Gascoigne told the court she was scared her testimony might bring revenge attacks on herself and her family, while Coogan said he was constantly offered private encouragement in his crusade by other celebrities who lacked ""the stomach"" to join him. ""When I took the News of the World to court [over phone hacking],"" Max Clifford told me, ""no one else would. Everyone was frightened. Everyone I spoke to said 'You're mad'."" Mad, in a uniquely powerful position given his line of work, and necessarily rich. Clifford's legal bills alone were well over £300,000. Yet while fear is likely a primary motivation, and not everyone has to be a hero, it would offer an incomplete picture not to suggest there are more complex reasons for those glaring absences in Court 73. The failure of what we might call the Primetime Celebrity Demographic to field any irate witnesses is a tacit acknowledgement of that. Some powerful – and powerfully sanguine – stars regard intrusion as the cost of doing business. Of the near-certainty that Simon Cowell's phone was hacked, the X Factor boss has said, ""I don't want to know"" – as well he might not, making £100m from Rupert Murdoch every year and having close friendships with many of those now under investigation. In most other cases, the trade-off is less clear cut, but the nature of stardom has to some extent always engendered co-dependencies between star, hack and fan, ranging from benign back-scratching to the most toxic abusive relationships. Those who work with stars often maintain that insecurity and paranoia are among the defining celebrity character traits, and the panders of the press still effectively control most entertainers' access to their public. This will remain an eternally dysfunctional relationship, and one can only hope Leveson's inquiry will spend less time failing to unravel it than assisting the ordinary people who become ""famous"" against their will. • For legal reasons this article will not be open to comments",Phone-hacking inquiry: the rebel army has yet to press-gang Primetime Celeb | Marina Hyde,2011-11-25T21:30:01Z,Marina Hyde,uk
"Are we all doomed? America's fiscal democracy this week collapsed in disarray. The Arab spring ran out of steam. Emergency regimes have taken power in Greece and Italy, while Germany could not sell a third of its bonds. Salvation, according to Europe's desperate ""leader"", José Manuel Barroso, can only lie in ""stronger governance in the euro area, both in discipline and in convergence"". He wants nation states to submit draft budgets of their taxing and spending to him for oversight, to be subject to Brussels' ""enhanced surveillance"". This is more than alarming. Today's European crisis was brought about by widespread popular revolt against the straitjacket of an unrealistic European monetary union. Barroso's solution is apparently an even tighter straitjacket, and no nonsense about popular elections or national referendums. He wants Europe ruled by Aristotle's aristocrats, by people like him. We know what smart politics says. Yes, we have been here before, in the 1900s and the 1930s, but then we were led by donkeys and drifted into war. There have been blips since then, in the 1970s and 1990s, but we survived. As the Economist magazine loftily commented this month of the present wreckage, ""the EU … will muddle through … Europe will breathe a sigh of relief and continue down the path of genteel decline"". I have long been of this Micawberish persuasion but I am starting to have my doubts. The ideology of the 1990s was of ""democratic inevitability"" – Francis Fukuyama's destination of history. It seduced western governments into massive deficit financing, into inflating their housing markets and courting votes with ever more borrowing and spending. In the US this has concluded in a constitutional crisis, as a congressional super-committee fails to resolve the country's indebtedness. The same ideology led US and British troops into neoconservative wars to ""promote freedom"" at the point of a gun across the Muslim world. It fuelled the ambition of a new generation of urban Arabs to rise up against authoritarian regimes, many to dissolve into renewed conflict. Democracy is everywhere in tears (except, dare I say it, in South America). Who is laughing? Dictatorial China, while Europe grovels for money at its feet. Moscow's oligarchs, just two decades after suffering the greatest humiliation in Russian history. Laughing too are the kleptocrats of Africa and Asia. So are Europe's unelected patricians as they slide effortlessly into the seats of power, handing down daily bromides and diktats to the miserable helots of Euro-democracy. Any competent observer can conjure some hope from this mess. Perhaps the Greek and Italian regimes are merely facilitators, to correct past mistakes and push through austerity measures before reverting to national elections. Perhaps their debts, like those of Spain and others, can be rescheduled and met. Perhaps the EU needs only to click into a new gear, with new disciplines under the benign guidance of a bountiful Germany. Perhaps the US will retrench budgetarily under a re-elected Obama administration. That is what happened in the 1970s, when grim commentators wondered if ""stagflation"" might spell the end of democracy. Then, a series of Times articles wondered if electors would ever vote for the discipline necessary to escape the politics of tax, borrow and spend. Would social democracy not have to give way to oligarchy? The answer was no. People voted not just for Margaret Thatcher but for conservative governments in the US and elsewhere in Europe. The 1970s are not today. Under the credit bubble, European electorates have voted for one spendthrift government after another and built up stupefying debts. When they were told to repent and accept austerity, they voted those governments out. The US, so often lauded as a successful ""fiscal union"", saw Republicans plunge new depths of economic mismanagement, with reckless tax cuts and wars. Today's predicament is unquestionably worse than the 1970s. Democracy is supposedly a self-correcting mechanism. The US historian Arthur Schlesinger used to reassure audiences that the US constitution always took the republic to the brink of disaster, but hauled it back at the last minute. This thesis is now being tested to destruction. American democracy is in the grip of lawyers and lobbyists. Britain's genius for consensus could not curb Gordon Brown's Neronian Treasury. It was the same across Europe. Electorates goaded politicians to promise ever more. Some preached prudence but none practised it. The present eulogising of technocracy, of the power of economic technique unsullied by the mob, has always been the harbinger of dictatorship. We should remember how many Britons admired the efficiency of 1930s Germany and lauded Mussolini's trains running on time. Then, too, it was thought unimaginable that Europe would ever go to war. Who until recently thought that British soldiers would die in their hundreds for ""regime change"" in Iraq and Afghanistan, or that Whitehall would be preparing for war with Iran? Greece is now talking of a ""German protectorate"". The technocrat Italian prime minister, Mario Monti, warns his people that ""the management of the crisis has suffered from a deficiency of government, and must be overcome with action at a European level"". We need not reproduce the Greek magazine's cover of a swastika on the Acropolis to shudder at the phrases ""deficiency of government"" and ""action at a European level"". We heard those phrases before. Consider the euphemisms. Barroso stamps on a possible Greek referendum as ""a breach of trust"". In whom? The new German hegemony (which many Germans are commendably resisting) is called ""enhanced co-operation"". Even a Guardian headline takes as axiomatic that a two-speed Europe is to be ""feared"". Fast is synonymous with euro membership, German discipline, technocracy and progress; slow with a ""peripheral"", populist democracy. Ten years ago, a Norwegian government study on the future of democracy warned that it was not an inevitable state of government. It could default into oligarchy as easily in Oslo, Moscow or London as it did in ancient Greece. Rule of the people by the people for the people needs to be guarded and constantly refreshed. It withers first at the local level, as in Britain after a generation of centralism. This narrows and clogs access to the seat of power, restricting it to a class of technocratic professionals in cahoots with big money. It happened in interwar Germany. It is happening now in Washington and the upper echelons of most European governments. Pessimism always has the best tunes, and I remain instinctively an optimist. I still cheer when I see democracy's shrivelled hordes assert themselves in the street. My brain may be with technocracy, but my heart is with the majority, hoping that the two can resume consummation. But we should remember Schumpeter's warning, of capitalism's tendency to self-destruction and socialism's to fascism. Both, he said, were history's ""jokes of questionable taste"". Perhaps we shall still muddle through. But it will not be by jeering at democratic institutions or blandly awarding power to unaccountable oligarchs. That way democracy really will find itself at the wrong end of a rubber bullet.",It is not inevitable that the EU – or democracy – will survive this mess,2011-11-24T21:00:05Z,Simon Jenkins,world
"Here's a game you can play at home. Ask your friends how much they reckon the head of human resources at Cadbury, the chocolate company, pocketed for the last year for which we have figures. In my experience, the guessing will open at around the £100,000 or £150,000 mark. Then, realising that the answer must be stunning or else you wouldn't be asking the question, people go higher, suggesting £300,000 or even £500,000. Those who place their bet at that very top end tend to smile at the absurdity of it, acknowledging in advance the madness of such a high salary. So far, in two years of playing this game, I have never seen anyone get the right answer. Which is that in 2008 Bob Stack, then head of HR for Cadbury, was rewarded with a package totalling £3.8m, including £2m in exercised share options. The aptly named Stack retired with all that and an £8m pension pot, paying him £700,000 this year and every year. It's a choice example, even if Cadbury, gobbled up by Kraft, is, like Stack, no longer part of the British corporate scene. No matter how inured you think you are to runaway executive salaries, laid bare by this week's report of the High Pay Commission, that one makes the jaw drop. For Stack was not some master of the universe CEO, heading up a global financial behemoth. He ran the personnel department at a chocolate company. That's not a trivial job. But a basic package of nearly £2m a year? It makes no sense. Ask people to pinpoint the problem and they might struggle to be specific. They just find it appalling that, as the commission found, today's CEO is often paid 70, 80 or over 100 times the salary of their average worker, when three decades ago the ratio usually stood at 13 to 1. A gap has turned into a vast, ever widening chasm. Why does this matter exactly? You can't simply whine that it's unfair, insisted the executive recruiter Heather McGregor on the Today programme. ""Anyone over the age of seven who complains that things are not fair needs a reality check,"" she said. Deborah Hargreaves, the High Pay Commission chair, is ready with grown-up, hard-headed arguments for why runaway pay is bad for business. When those at the top are getting so much more than their subordinates, workers get demoralised, Hargreaves told me; absenteeism increases, and staff refuse to engage with management or support the corporate mission. When the average salary has increased just threefold over the last 30 years, it makes workers sullen and resentful to note that, say, the head of Barclays has seen his pay rise by nearly 5,000% over the same period. Free-wheeling capitalists should be particularly alarmed, says the commission. Gargantuan executive pay is sapping enterprise: people who might have been risk-taking entrepreneurs have no reason to start their own businesses when they are so comfortably looked after at corporate HQ. And of course such winner-takes-all rewards warp the wider economy. Housing in London is just one example. The bonus boys have driven up prices at the top end, pulling the whole housing market out of reach of would-be first-time buyers at the other end. It's trickle-down economics at its worst: the wealth of the rich doesn't cascade downwards, but its corrosive consequences do. Defenders of the wealthy brush aside such talk, certain their critics' real beef resides elsewhere, in envy or a retro-communist desire for uniformity. ""Move to Cuba"" was McGregor's most succinct soundbite. In one way she's right: concerns over worker demoralisation and reduced entrepreneurial spirit do not lie at the heart of the matter. Our objection to telephone-number salaries goes deeper. What it comes down to is desert – a notion so deeply ingrained that, yes, even a seven-year-old can grasp it: the belief that people should deserve the rewards they get. That's why the ""move to Cuba"" remark was so off beam. Most people have long accepted that there will be a differential in pay that, in the hoary example, the brain surgeon will earn more than the dustman. People understand that some skills are rare and therefore command a greater premium. They even accept that this can result in extreme outcomes, with the likes of Wayne Rooney trousering £250,000 a week. But none of that logic applies to the current state of corporate pay. Rooney is truly a one in a hundred million talent; there might be just two dozen people in the world who could match his skills. But with all due respect to Bob Stack, that is not true of him. Nor can it possibly be true of the 2,800 staff in 27 UK-based banks who, according to the Financial Services Authority, received more than £1m each in 2009. Whatever these people are able to do, it's clearly not rare. Ah, comes the reply, but these are the cream of the international crop, among the very best bankers in the world. The commission report blows a hole in that tired argument, revealing there's hardly any cross-border poaching of corporate talent. Not many of our monolingual high earners could work abroad and even fewer would want to. They like it here and do not have to be paid lottery jackpot money to stay. So rarity and competition can't justify these rates, and nor can any old-fashioned notion of desert: there is no society-wide consensus that says these people do such valuable, critical work they deserve their riches. On the contrary, we lament that the City lures maths and science graduates who might otherwise have become great engineers or scientists, paying them instead to move digits on a screen producing nothing of any discernible value whatsoever. When reward slips its moorings from merit, this surely poses a danger that goes beyond our economic prospects. What message are we sending the next generation of Britons? Why should they aspire to become a surgeon or a headteacher or a judge, when those once top-paid jobs now earn a tiny fraction of the salary attached to a relatively cushy, low-risk seat in the boardroom or on the trading floor? Strikingly, the commission found that even the mega-earners do not kid themselves they deserve their pay. They admitted that they had got lucky, that they worked no harder and risked no more than those earning much less. But they did think they were ""entitled"" to what they got. Hargreaves draws no parallel with the August rioters, except that they ""showed that same sense of entitlement, that they could take trainers or a TV, as those bankers who thought they could take a bonus, even if they had brought a bank to its knees"". The commission has plenty of bright ideas for change. Ignore the City bleats that meaningful action has to be international, which sadly is impossible: action has only been impossible up till now because the UK, batting for the City, has blocked any EU attempt to tackle high pay. But the larger change will be cultural. We need to revive the lost notion of merit and desert, to make those bagging huge, undeserved salaries feel a sense of shame or at least loss of reputation at such unwarranted rewards. We have the Fairtrade scheme, so why not a Fair Pay kitemark granted only to products made by companies who pay defensible rates? Such a seal of approval should be given only sparingly – only to those who have really earned it.",Our anger over runaway top pay is more about merit than money | Jonathan Freedland,2011-11-22T20:45:00Z,Jonathan Freedland,uk
"For the best part of two centuries, the British postal service was the wonder of the world. No other country delivered letters so cheaply, reliably and quickly. Most of the credit belongs to Rowland Hill, but even before he remade the institution in the 1840s, Britain's dedication to the speedy delivery of letters drew admiration at home and abroad. Purpose-built mail coaches pulled by relays of horses (four to every coach) had tightened British geography by the end of the 18th century, shrinking the five-day journey from London to Edinburgh to 60 hours and London-Bristol to an overnight gallop. Inside cities and towns, speedy ""penny posts"" flourished. John Keats finished ""On first looking into Chapman's Homer"" at dawn one October morning in 1816, put a copy in the post at Southwark, and the recipient was able to enjoy the sonnet an hour or two later over his 10 o'clock breakfast in Clerkenwell. The public revered the post for its military dash. Mail coach guards swore loyal oaths, wore scarlet tunics and had the right to shoot anyone they suspected of being an escaped French prisoner-of-war, with a £5 reward. In 1829, the Post Office opened its magnificent new headquarters in St Martin's le Grand, close to St Paul's and a must-see for foreign dignitaries after the cathedral's Whispering Gallery had been tested. The architect, Robert Smirke, was already working on designs for the British Museum when he got the commission and the General Post Office was equipped with similar Ionic columns and a Portland stone façade – illuminated at night with 1,000 gas flares, as a procession of mail coaches clip-clopped from the courtyard to begin their night-rides across Britain. Anthony Trollope, a junior clerk, once guided the queen of a German state around the building, walking every step backwards in front of her, which included the tricky negotiation of many stairs, and received half a crown for his courtesy. (""A bad moment,"" as Trollope remembered.) Still, the Post Office of that age was far from perfect. It was smug and conservative and operated a bewildering system of charges that varied according to how far a letter had to travel and how many sheets it contained, with the receiver and not the sender paying the costs; an important incentive, it was thought, to the post boys who had to deliver them. Hill, who came to the Post Office as a Treasury adviser, revolutionised every aspect of the business when he introduced the uniform penny post and commissioned the first adhesive stamps. None of his reforms was easily achieved. The political establishment thought he was crazy: the Treasury worked out that the current average price of sending a letter was sixpence, which meant that the Post Office would need to multiply its mail volumes six times simply to maintain its revenue. Government ministers saw this as impossibly ambitious (rightly so; decades passed before mail volumes rose so much), but the simplicity and cheapness of Hill's plans caught the public imagination and the penny post became a mass movement that, in Duncan Campbell-Smith's words, ""equalled anything seen on behalf of the abolition of slavery or even the reform of the parliamentary franchise"". And so the government gave in. Campbell-Smith sums up Hill as ""a workaholic autocrat"". But his sweeping postal reforms were vital to Britain's success as the world's leading industrial nation. It was so easy to be in touch. By the 1840s, the railways' travelling post offices were sorting letters en route. A north country manufacturer could have a reply from a London bank ""by return of post"" as the Royal Mail became a pulsing channel of business negotiation. Prices no longer excluded the working class, who might find themselves hundreds of miles from their relatives in a new industrial town. In the words of the social historian GM Trevelyan, Hill had ""enabled the poor, for the first time in the history of man, to communicate with the loved ones from whom they were separated"". Consequently, and unusually, the nation fell in love with a government department: ""It was universally seen as unique, not just as a flourishing business enterprise run by the state but as an organisation of unparalleled efficiency and trustworthiness."" For most people in Britain, the Post Office became ""the most familiar manifestation of the state in ordinary daily life"". And it grew and grew, changing the nation's habits and landscape. Hill and one of his associates invented the Christmas card. Trollope, by now working in the Channel Islands, heard reports about new-fangled post boxes in France and imported the idea. (After a standard colour was adopted in 1874, their splash of red gave the humblest village the glamour of distant communication.) The Post Office invented the postal order, set up a savings bank, hired thousands of boys to deliver telegrams, and built offices in provincial towns that in their elegance and importance rivalled France's hotels de ville. By 1914, it employed more people than the army, the navy and the royal dockyards combined. What went wrong? Digital communication has left every postal service in the world struggling to cope with a loss of trade, but long before that happened the British Post Office found its own peculiar difficulties, created in part by its Victorian success. Like much of British industry, it found modern inventions a nuisance. The government persuaded the PO before the first world war to take over a ramshackle telephone system, owned by a dozen different companies, but throughout the 1920s the PO did almost nothing to extract more money from what was a monopoly asset. Britain ranked 12th in the world in the number of telephones per 1,000 people in 1929. Among cities, London came as low as 27th. Marketing was an anathema. A small revolution occurred in the 30s – when the PO snapped awake to the potential of telephones and in Night Mail commissioned one of the most brilliant publicity films ever made – but it went on thinking of itself primarily as a deliverer of letters; not unreasonably, because letters still accounted for 90% of its income. By the 70s, the main problems were size and torpor. A head-count of 430,000 employees made it the biggest business in Britain, and though by now it was a public corporation rather than a government department, its upper management still ran along civil service grooves. Down below, trade unions ran the shop floor, planned the overtime rotas, and, particularly in the London sorting offices, grew solid in their opposition to productivity agreements and mechanised sorting: the postal section of the London District Council (LDC3) made its initials notorious as ""a kind of workers' Soviet"". Losses mounted. The inflation-adjusted cost of posting a half-ounce letter had never been lower, not even in Hill's day, but mail volumes (unlike labour costs) began to fall. Even in this melancholy atmosphere, the PO managed to go on innovating – where would a satnav be without postcodes? – and then in the 1980s a surge in mail volumes suddenly overturned the prevailing wisdom of ""managed decline"". The number of letters posted rose by more than a quarter between 1982 and 1987. Mail shots poured out of personal computers, ink-jet printers and high-speed copiers – new office technologies that gave the Royal Mail an unexpected Indian summer. Social correspondence – letters between individuals needing a stamp and a walk to the pillarbox – now accounted for only 15% of letters. Everything else was ""business"" mail. In the 1840s, William Wordsworth had complained that all cheap postage had done was increase the number of time-wasting letters from strangers. Now we were all Wordsworths, but to the Post Office's great advantage. What was a government to do with such success? The telecoms division had already been successfully privatised in 1984, but Mrs Thatcher revealed a surprisingly sentimental streak when it came to the mail and insisted the Post Office remain in public ownership. (Why? Because of stamps with the Queen's head? The friendly postmen of her childhood? Nobody knew.) If the PO had been allowed commercial freedom as a public corporation, this might have been good news. Instead the Treasury used it as a milch-cow, creaming off profits that were badly needed for investment so that sometimes the PO kept staff on because it couldn't afford their redundancy payments. Meanwhile the Department of Trade and Industry set up a zealous regulator, Postcomm, which on the one hand could curb rises in the postage rate and on the other could demand that the PO's monopoly be opened to private competition. Postcomm insisted it was simply following EU directives, but its puritanical dedication to the free market ideal amazed the Royal Mail's counterparts elsewhere in Europe. The pressures drove the Post Office into successive waves of corporate reorganisation, or what Campbell-Smith calls ""death by a thousand plans"". For a mercifully brief time it even gave itself a new name, Consignia. Managers spent more time trying to implement change than they did looking after the business. By 2002, ""Blair and his ministers were faced with a Post Office in total financial disarray. Five years of frenetic reorganisations had reduced it to a state of virtual collapse."" This is a majestic account of a great institution's rise and fall. It doesn't close without hope: the author thinks the British postal service may have a modest, privatised future as a kind of co-op where users and staff hold the shares, trading on the British public's ""abundant good will"" towards the Royal Mail. It's hard to read his closing chapters, however, without being angered at the spectacular muddle and carelessness of recent British governments, which first bled a national asset dry and then poked the carcass with sticks. • Ian Jack's The Country Formerly Known as Great Britain is published by Vintage.",Masters of the Post: The Authorized History of the Royal Mail by Duncan Campbell-Smith – review,2011-11-22T09:00:04Z,Ian Jack,review

Public fury would suggest that its not only Ms Hume's family who believe the fall alone wasn't responsible for her death, and that ""health and safety"" should be in the dock. This isn't an isolated case: in 2007, 10-year-old Jordan Lyon drowned in a pond, watched by two police community officers, who said that regulations barred them from rescuing him. Earlier this year, Simon Burgess, 41, suffered a blackout and drowned in 3ft of water, because police, firemen and paramedics at the scene were instructed to wait for a specialised rescue team. Such incidents eat like a cancer into the trust the British public have for the emergency services. Horrible enough to lose a loved one, but how much worse to lose them because some jobsworth with a clipboard was following regulations? Still, as the nation rushes to burn health and safety at the stake, could we really do without it? To my mind, it's dangerous nonsense to dismiss all health and safety as hot air and red tape. Its origins lie in the desire to protect vulnerable workforces – everyone from miners and builders to farm and factory workers, including children, who were exposed to mercury, asbestos and pesticides, or worked with machinery that maimed and killed. Many are still killed every year in work-related incidents, with even more left in unsatisfactory conditions. All this considered, I have more respect for the basic premise of health and safety, than for employers who endlessly whinge about how annoying and expensive it is to treat their workforce fairly. However, this does not excuse the stifling of our emergency services, or the deaths of Alison Hume, Jordan Lyon and Simon Burgess. The public needs to believe in the emergency services, for what is the alternative? People losing faith and taking crises into their own hands – embarking on ""vigilante"" rescue missions, that are ill-considered and dangerous? Saying that, it might be time to drop the unjust attitude that emergency services personnel are always in the wrong for not tearing up the rule book, and performing rescues regardless. These are real professional lives – not movies where the maverick hero breaks the rules and saves the day. It is unfair to place our emergency services in an ongoing moral maze, where they risk being sacked and/or sued for not following guidelines. No one could work like that. Is it inconceivable to find a middle ground? Couldn't there be a division of 999 to deal with truly exceptional emergency situations: a hotline that firemen, police officers or paramedics could ring, explain the special circumstances, and receive instant official permission to proceed? Basically, a health and safety waiver, granted by a team of operatives, maybe including retired professionals and volunteer members of the public, who've been trained to quickly assess individual scenarios. This wouldn't be the end of bad judgment calls, but it would at least remove the burden of sole responsibility from personnel at the scene. It would also take minutes, rather than the ghastly eight hours endured by a mother as she lay dying in a mine shaft. While human error will always be with us, Alison Hume's life could so easily have been saved. Health and safety isn't quite the bureaucratic bogeyman that it's widely painted to be, but maybe it's time to consider a back-up plan.  Characters, not glamour models, are what we need This year's line-up for I'm a Celebrity looks like Nuts magazine, guest edited by The Golden Girls. Contestant Antony Cotton (Sean from Coronation Street) commented that the average age in camp made it feel like a remake of Ron Howard's ""senior drama"" Cocoon. Fair point, but it's the young ones who are the problem. Now they're sending in a second glamour model. Yawn. One understands that it's reality TV law that there have to be nubile women showering under the fake waterfall (for men who've never had a girlfriend they didn't have to inflate), but these aren't classic IAC Moments. This isn't Gillian McKeith fake-swooning or Shaun Ryder threatening to throttle her, as happened last year. I'm still mourning the no-show of confessional journalist Liz Jones, as I was looking forward to a vegan at a bushtucker trial, telling them where to shove their witchetty grubs. (Go, girl!) She would have been a right handful, which is the point. This show is all about characters, not glamour; high drama, not low BMI. Sticking to models is just lazy casting and won't get people talking. What's easy on the eye can be boring at the water cooler. Fame's gone straight to their heads Actor Mackenzie Crook has attributed his slipped discs to constantly hunching his back to avoid being recognised. Initially, I was bemused – unless Crook is secretly Madonna, he can't get that much aggravation. Perhaps instead of hunching, he could grin and bear the odd bore, cleverly shouting: ""Oi, Gareth from The Office!"" across the street. This is a whole new level of workplace injury – Celebrity Fan Avoidance. You can see the TV adverts now: ""Were you injured doing your celebrity work? Did you twist your ankle running from fans or sprain your wrist signing autographs? Make a claim with our no-win, no-fee service."" At the opposite end of the spectrum, there is Phantom Fans Syndrome. It's the same principle as phantom limb, only with the sufferer imagining they have fans. There was a distressing case only last week, involving X Factor's Kitty Brucknell. Having already displayed tell-tale symptoms (bursting into song when not on stage, performing the splits for no reason), Brucknell threw water over her head while performing at a computer game launch, even though she was surrounded by live electrical equipment. Experts I've just made up say that it's the worst case of PFS they've ever seen. Every time Ms Brucknell sees a gathering of, erm, one or more people, she immediately suffers terrifying delusions that they are fans. There are some dreadful afflictions that could befall the famous: Personal Appearance Fatigue – celebrities who open supermarkets and start cutting ribbons and social-smiling in their sleep; Seasonal Retinal Erosion, where they are temporarily blinded by all the Christmas lights they've turned on. And, of course, Enamel Crumble, brought on by over-zealous tooth whitening. With our two featured celebrities, it's difficult to determine who's got it worse, Crook, with his Celebrity Fan Avoidance injury, or Kitty B risking electrocution due to Phantom Fans Syndrome. One can only hope our A&E departments can cope.",Health and safety rules should have a get-out clause | Barbara Ellen,2011-11-20T00:07:16Z,Barbara Ellen,society
"Joshua Cody issues a warning to readers who pick up [Sic], his cleverly entitled memoir of cancer and recovery. ""I'm not really a writer,"" he writes. ""I'm just writing this one thing and that's it."" Later, he suggests that writing is too grand a word for what he is doing; ""frapping"" is better. This coyness of style, heavily influenced by his hero David Foster Wallace, is contrived to seem throwaway and encompasses bracketed asides, paragraph-long sentences, footnotes, diagrams, algebraic formulae, an inevitable deadpan analysis of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and stretches of regular narrative through which the story is good enough, just, to survive. Cody was finishing a PhD in music composition at Columbia University when he felt a pain in his neck from what he thought was a pulled muscle. The first doctor said it was a virus. The second doctor said it was probably a virus but to be safe did a biopsy and discovered a malignant tumour. Cody started an aggressive course of treatment: high-dose chemo followed by a bone marrow transplant, which the doctor described to him, chillingly, as ""relatively endurable"". There followed months of hell, a near-death experience, the fluctuating involvement of various girlfriends and Cody's attempt to make sense of what was happening to him, or as he puts it, ""how different the meanings of things were then – even the meanings of things as simple as water, or taxonomy, or, indeed, what it means to mean"". If there is a rationale for the book's endless diversions – the first few pages alone take in Debussy, how the ear works, the history of Manhattan's 59th Street Bridge and a reading of Raiders of the Lost Ark – it is this question of significance, the sudden value of all things in a life reframed by death. According to his account, at the time of diagnosis Cody was enjoying a busy social life hanging out in bars, dating models and excusing himself periodically to do coke in public bathrooms before returning to his apartment in Tribeca – not a lifestyle most graduate students can afford and an anomaly that is never quite explained. He makes the sly observation about his version of Manhattan that it's a city ""where everyone is over-educated and overpaid and broke at the same time, and everyone wears basically the same clothes and has a book deal about to go through"". Beyond that, Cody and common experience diverge. There is his girlfriend the dominatrix; there is his girlfriend the model (""will the felicity of her Nabokovian exquisiteness finally flinch once and forever, like Eurydice slipping away – despite the lyre, the frantic fretwork, and the song – "" it goes on) who has a plaster cast of her own breasts on the wall, taken just before her double mastectomy. A veteran of cancer, she comforts him after diagnosis. There is the woman he meets on the street, several weeks into treatment, who, after falling into step with him, asks if she can come up to his apartment, whereupon they have the kind of sex you can apparently only have while facing death and with someone whose name you don't know. She cries when he tells her about his illness. It is passages such as these that make you wonder at the publisher's decision to invoke, as a comparison, James Frey's discredited memoir A Million Little Pieces. Two strands carry the book: Cody's moving and mercifully unmannered account of his parents; and the misfortune he has to fall in love with a medic at the hospital who turns out to be crazy. It was Cody's parents who introduced him to the writers and artists he turns to for comfort during his illness. In the cancer ward, he holds on to an old book on Paul Klee like a security blanket. He rereads his favourite writers, Eliot, Auden, Pound, searching for consolation and explanation. He considers the meaning of Mahler. You get the feeling that Cody, by training a composer, is trying to push through to a kind of non-referential language that mimics the effect of music – ""the joy of letting meandering thoughts meander"". It is only when he drops all this that his skill as a writer becomes evident. When he is in the chemo ward, he reports on the cheerfulness of staff and patients and how, although sincere, it triggers a deep revulsion in him. There is, he writes, ""something exceedingly grotesque about it all, as if everyone were sitting around (I hesitate to use this image, but it did come to mind repeatedly) defecating while making affable conversation"". There are vivid passages about his childhood: a trip to a diner with his mother when he is a child; conversations with his father about music they both admire; the poignancy of his parents' separation and his father's early death. His mother is a fierce advocate for Cody in the hospital, but it's the flashbacks to her quiet, sad collapse during the breakup of her marriage, when she couldn't bear to listen to ""serious music"" any more because it was too painful, that jump from the book. When Cody falls in love with the doctor on his pain management team, he subtly indicates that something is wrong, signs his friends see but which, in his ""infatuation with her salt-bright beauty"", he is blind to, right up to the point when ""she walks into the restaurant with an uncanny smile"" and says something so jaw-droppingly awful that you gasp. Stripped of contortions, the book comes suddenly to life.",[Sic] by Joshua Cody - review,2011-11-18T22:55:00Z,Emma Brockes,review
"Meryl Streep is undoubtedly a great actor. Amazingly, I am not. So I did my best to act casually when she served me apple pie that she had baked herself. But my stomach was churning because of the film in which I had just seen her. She plays Margaret Thatcher in the biopic The Iron Lady. She is mesmeric on screen and indeed in the flesh. I have never before been to a screening and then taxied with a handful of female journalists to a house where a superstar cooks for you. On the way we were given readymade gin and tonics. ""I have never had one of these before,"" said my colleague Polly Toynbee, ""it's rather lovely."" ""But what are we going to say?"" I wailed, as we wondered if we could escape for a pizza with Jenni Murray. For everyone involved in the film, including the director, Phyllida Lloyd, and the writer, Abi Morgan, were to be at the dinner too. All good women. Strong and true and not natural fans of Thatcher. Yet as the film starts with Thatcher as a senile, lonely old lady, it inadvertently garners sympathy for her. One cannot still be angry with a weak old woman, surely? Well there is always an exception to the rule. Thatcher was always the exception to the rules, the exception that kept the rules in place. After a few drinks, I think I tried to tell Meryl that I was of the Tramp the Dirt Down persuasion, but I wasn't, at that stage, sure if she knew the Elvis Costello song. I did tell her that when Thatcher was elected it was only a matter of time before we began to see profound change. I had just been hitchhiking around Europe and was shocked to see beggars on the streets of Lisbon. Within a year, London was full of young homeless people and Cardboard City was erected. But I can see why any clever actor would be drawn to play Thatcher – the woman is the ultimate drama queen, performing ""femininity"" when it suited her. Thatcher instinctively knew how to switch between housewife/ governess/warrior queen, and Streep captures this perfectly. The film's problem is that it buys into Thatcher's own interpretation of herself far too much. For crucial to her own self-image was the persona of a woman at perpetual war, politically, nationally, internationally. Where there was harmony she brought discord. Some Tories have said it is demeaning to portray Thatcher's dementia. I note they are still prepared to dress her up and wheel her out when it suits them. My difficulty with the film is that there is no sense of Thatcher's political coming of age. The supreme conviction politician, yes, but those convictions were driven by ideology shaped by Keith Joseph among others. Privatisation, the selling off of council housing, war against the unions was all done in the name of monetarism, or ""sado-monetarism"" as some dubbed it. The Iron Lady though, shows Thatcher in a vacuum, a lone woman battling against ranks of men. The footage that threads through the film – Brixton in flames, the miners being pushed back by massed ranks of police – shows all opposition to her as being violent rioters and trade unionists. This is a conservative narrative and just not how it was. The luminous Streep talked as we ate of how difficult it is to get a film made for older women and not teenage boys. Mamma Mia! helped change that. I guess this wasn't the time to say I don't even like Abba. For what is still vivid for me are those ""The Enemy Within"" badges that I stuck on my pregnant belly during the miners' strike, our last civil war. The Enemy Within remains the clue to Thatcher's psychological makeup surely? But we were now talking about the brilliance of the actual makeup that ages Streep in the film. As the film trots through history, we see Thatcher's high point: actual war. The Falklands. We see that she was indeed transgressive in terms of class and gender, so inevitably the film makes her heroic. We don't see the victims of her policies. The mess we are in now is a direct result of much of what she initiated. Part of her phallic potency was always to conjure the chaos about to break out unless we buckled under. The film feels shot from this viewpoint. But Streep told us this was a film about grief and loss. It is. The Tories are still in mourning for her and feel guilty about deposing her. She is the ghost that has haunted every leader since. The context into which this film will be released is one of Tory government, social unrest and deep recession. Many will pine again for such a strong leader, forgetting how such leaders punish the weak. To bite the hand that fed me pie is a bit much, I know. All I can say is that the hatred Thatcher invokes is bitter and visceral for those of us who lived through it. But this film, because of its magnificent central performance, will evoke more celebration of her. I am happy enough to pay my respects to Streep, who even came out into the garden for a quick fag with us, but pay respect to the woman she portrays? Sorry no. Can't pay, won't pay, as we once said of the poll tax.",Where was the mention of Margaret Thatcher's victims? | Suzanne Moore,2011-11-16T19:59:00Z,Suzanne Moore,politics
"It's not often that the luminously arrogant Prince William catches the attention for a good reason, so respect to him for being instrumental in overturning Fifa's ban on the England football team wearing poppies for yesterday's friendly against Spain. Initially Fifa's rationale was that every international team would want to do something similar, and we might end up with questionable politics on kit everywhere. Fair enough, but surely the poppy, of all things, is beyond politics – so potent and elastic a symbol, it can be pro-humanity and anti-war simultaneously. The new bling style of poppy (snazzy, festooned with crystals, popularised by celebrities) also makes a statement loud and clear. It says: ""I'm a self-obsessed airhead, and probably a tightwad with it."" Bling poppies have been selling by the shedload, but while the ones from jewellers Buckley, sold on the Royal British Legion site, give the bulk of their profits to the charity, others such as the £59.95 crystal-studded job by Kleshna, donate only 10%. ""I run a business but genuinely want to give to charity,"" says the Kleshna owner, seemingly oblivious to obscure business concepts such as loss leaders and positive PR. Elsewhere, people who wear bling poppies talk about the rejuvenation of the poppy concept, giving it a modern, individualistic spin, and what could be wrong with that? Oh dear, where do we start? First, no one should be messing with the traditional simple paper poppy. It's a design classic, all the more wonderful because it is so badly designed. It has a buttonhole-proof stem (too short, always falling out), and little pins that either stick you, or fall off immediately. Good. For fundraising purposes, it needs to be badly designed. It means that it must be replaced every year, or even more regularly (I've lost and re-bought four this year). By contrast, the bling poppy is like a hardy brooch; a robust piece of jewellery that can be recycled year in, year out. It does not get the return traffic of the traditional poppy. Hence for all the initial expense, and despite the fact that wearers pose about like they've made an extra-special effort and care more deeply (and photogenically) than anyone else, the opposite is true. Their bling poppy could last for years, while the rest of us keep re-buying. In effect, the blingee is wittingly or unwittingly being a poppy tightwad– remembering the war dead on the cheap. Nice. But ,of course, the poppy is being reappropriated, just as its meaning is continually hijacked. Increasingly, there are people fretting about the rights and wrongs of poppy-wearing. What they don't seem to realise is that the poppy has not just been hijacked by the showily pious, but also by these woolly worriers. They have more in common with the bling poppy-wearers than they like to think. Both are making it all about themselves, placing their feelings, their sensitivities and individualism, at the heart of the issue. With both groups, its all: ""Me, me, me, how do I feel, what do I think?"" When, surely, the whole point of the poppy is to put ""self"" aside and think of others. This is why the poppy is so important and beautiful, and a certain type of poppy (paper, easily lost, ridiculously flimsy) will always be more important and beautiful than others. What you are buying (and feel free to stuff £60 into the tin) is not only a sense of humanity and community, but also patriotism untarnished. Did I say buying? I meant renting. Poppies are supposed to be flimsy and temporary, they're supposed to fall off and get lost, you're supposed to keep buying them, and donating. Anyone with a more complicated or fashion-forward agenda doesn't deserve to wear one. It's a job not to stress about work A study reveals that people in workplaces suffer ""secondhand"" stress from their moaning, complaining workmates. This can be a big problem, leading to depression, de-motivation, and bogus sick days. However, another study says that working from home can be just as tough – with work-life boundaries blurred, and family chores casually left to the homeworker. It seems that British workers are doomed, whichever way they play it. If they work in an office environment, they risk being sent mad by Ken from Accounts' incessant moaning about his in-growing toenail and/or fight with the council for planning permission for his conservatory, If they work at home, they end up fetching everyone's dry cleaning, and feeling obliged to put the vacuum around, when they should be sitting in front of the computer, eating Snack a Jacks, and watching YouTube – oops, sorry, I meant working. As a homeworker of many years standing, with curiously no objection from my employers, I can say that it's a genuine privilege to conduct 90% of one's ""career"" in pyjamas, with access to fridge-based snacks, and cat-napping opportunities. On the other hand, there is that ""escaping"" factor that the office-bound enjoy, which is envied by all homeworkers. Office workers also tend to be cleaner, with brushed hair and real shoes on – all impossible dreams for homeworkers. What are we to deduce from this? That working in both fashions has positives but also negatives? Indeed, the solution seems to be to give up, not work at all, and just lie around the place, being bone idle, eventually expiring in an impoverished cobwebbed heap in front of This Morning. Alternatively, we could all stop moaning about our lot to people with research clipboards, and actually get some work done … Just saying. Please, please, please, let me live in John Lewis land For those yet to see the John Lewis Christmas advert, this is a spoiler. We watch a little boy becoming impatient for Christmas to arrive to the delicate sound of Amelia Warner's cover of the Smiths' ""Please, Please, Please Let Me Get What I Want""to Amelia Warner's cover of The Smiths' ""Please, Please, Please Let Me Get What I Want"". However, on Christmas morning he ignores his own stocking, surprising his parents with a gift, with the tag line, ""The gifts you can't wait to give"". Cue noisy sobbing among the Cath Kidston crockery nationwide. Not from me, mind – I just had something in my eye. While no one expected Ken Loach levels of realism, this is middle England wish fulfilment in excelsis. Consumerism with a butterfly kiss. Starring the child you wish you had, instead of your real ones, who will spend Christmas morning with a face full of chocolate reindeer, forgetting to say thank you, smelling faintly of wee, and whining for batteries. And that's just the teenagers. In this way, John Lewis has produced an ad that gives a high of familial wellbeing, followed by a slump as reality hits. The bastards. Some people were surprised that the miserable Morrissey allowed John Lewis to use the song. He knew what he was doing.",Show some style and fork out for a proper poppy | Barbara Ellen,2011-11-13T00:04:00Z,Barbara Ellen,uk
"Can people who didn't experience the first world war ever know – really know – what it was like? The question troubled a French civil servant, Michel Corday, in 1917. Not that Corday ever smelled a trench or heard a shell explode; in Paris and far from the frontline, it seemed to him that even civilian life would be hard for a historian to reproduce accurately. So little of the evidence could be trusted. He knew from conversations overheard on trams and in the street that people had begun to long for peace. But the word was taboo: it could hardly be spoken aloud because it suggested defeatism and compromise when what the state wanted was victory. Newspapers were strictly censored and run by propagandists, warmongers and ideologues – their reporting would be an unreliable guide in the future to the public mood of the past. Photography couldn't be counted on either: ""Vanity or shame prevents certain aspects of life from being reflected in our illustrated magazines."" As for private correspondence, men who wrote from the front knew that their letters might be opened and therefore they gave ""a false feeling about the war"". This wasn't just a problem for the years ahead. As Corday noted in his journal, it was the same combination of ignorance and denial that kept the catastrophe going so long. The French public never suspected for a moment they would be able to stop the war – ""that its parasitic life depends on their acquiescence"". Nearly a hundred years later, we know that Corday's fears about our understanding of 1914-18 were to a great extent misplaced. Postwar revulsion throughout Europe quickly stripped away the thin layer of patriotism that had varnished terrible events. New historical approaches ranked the experience of private soldiers above that of generals. Wilfred Owen became a classroom favourite, as did the hard-to-contradict phrase ""useless slaughter"". The causes and consequences of the war have been endlessly unpicked and debated. Its presence as the first of the great shadows to be cast across the last century is there. We know the thing generally: as sandbags, screaming shells, bodies hanging on the old barbed wire and poppies growing in the mud. And also particularly: in Britain, at least, the western front counts for most. Among the great merits of Peter Englund's book is its geographical scope, which takes in Mesopotamia, east Africa, the Dolomites, the Balkans and Russia as well the familiar imagery of Flanders and Verdun. We reach these places through the stories of 20 men and women of at least a dozen nationalities, which Englund has assembled from diaries, memories and journals (including Corday's). He wanted what he calls ""a work of anti-history"", which by taking 20 people and following them through the length of the war (or until they die in it) would try to transform a vast, cloudy event into a telling patchwork of particular experience. His cast is tremendously various, ranging from a Venezuelan cavalryman who served in the Ottoman army to a German schoolgirl and a Scottish nurse. Their words form only a small part of each of the interwoven episodes, which Englund writes in a telegraphic present tense alive with detail. The technique invites suspicion – how does Englund know that on a particular day a particular place had ""sun-warmed grass smelling of summer"", unless the original text has bothered to tell him? But as he is both an academic historian and the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel for literature, he surely knows – and respects – the difference between a fact and a factoid. In any event, this reader could detect no false notes in the narratives, which make this a literary as well as historical achievement (well served by its English translator, Peter Graves). Some things in it can never be forgotten. Fear, especially, is brought alive. When René Arnaud's infantry battalion hears that it's about to be sent again to Verdun, 50 or so men crowd around an army doctor citing anything – hernias, rheumatism, murmuring hearts – that will get them off the hook. As Arnaud records, men clung to him ""like drowning men clinging to a life-buoy"". Meanwhile in Paris troops seek out prostitutes who might give them venereal disease. There is even a trade in gonococcal pus, which soldiers buy and smear into their genitals in the hope of a long stay in hospital; according to Englund, the more desperate also smear it into their eyes and end up permanently blind. How can a war be sustained when it provokes such dread in its combatants? In the Italian army, Paulo Monelli watches as two deserters are shot by members of their own unit. The condemned men scream, shout, weep and plead, and at first the firing squad refuses to fire. But at the third command they do – the Italian army believes in iron discipline and executes many more of its own men than either Britain or Germany (the figures are respectively 1,000, 361 and 48). ""All armies,"" Englund writes, ""function on a mixture of external compulsion and consent (spontaneous or orchestrated); indeed, this whole war originated in a meeting of those two concepts."" But when consent goes completely and order depends on compulsion, ""the whole edifice collapses"". In Germany come the autumn of 1918 this more or less happens. Seaman Richard Stumpf has spent his entire war on a battleship that rarely puts to sea and has never fired a gun in anger. We meet Stumpf in several episodes, complaining about the lack of action. But rather than the enemy, the people he has come to loathe are the ship's officers, who enjoy a life of privileged, drunken idleness. Refusing to obey orders becomes a routine event, leading to a mutiny when the fleet is ordered to sea for one last glorious battle. The mutiny becomes a revolutionary march through the port of Wilhelmshaven, unopposed by the officers. Somebody waves a red flag. Germany is starving, disillusioned and exhausted. A week later the war ends. The lucky survivors are not the people they were in 1914. • Ian Jack's The Country Formerly Known as Great Britain is published by Vintage.",The Beauty and the Sorrow by Peter Englund - review,2011-11-11T22:55:00Z,Ian Jack,review
"This is the way the world ends, not with a bang but a cliche. Crisis spirals out of control and Armageddon moves to the brink of abyss. ""Europe"" is too big to fail yet too big to succeed. Each newscast is a crash course in economics, each headline an incitement to suicide. But since we are not at war and few understand what is going on, the rest cannot believe it. As if watching the fall of Icarus, they sense the gods are angry but return quietly to the plough. This week the European backwash of the crash of 2008 moved way beyond high finance. Economics may have pushed politics to the wall, but in Greece, Italy and, more important, Germany, politics is hitting back, hard. Yelling, spitting and choking with frustration, it has had enough of economics, and has beaten it to the ground. Yesterday it claimed its first scalp, demanding a new ruler of Greece. There is no point in European Union acolytes loftily opining that ""it was a pity"" Greece was admitted to the euro. It was more than a pity, it was a crime. There is no point in bewailing the reluctance of Germans to bail out Greeks or Latins, or let their bankers print billions of cash. There is no point in hectoring or dreaming. A 50-year fiction is over. As often before in history, a new Europe must be built on the ruins of the old, and we had better get used to it. It is a massive irony that old Europe's last gasp should be to seek the very outcome it sought in the 1950s to avoid, German supremacy. The one thing on which I agree with my colleague, Timothy Garton Ash, on Comment is freeyesterday, is that ""if the eurozone is saved, it will be as a fiscal union on largely German terms"". Substitute the word political for fiscal, as honesty dictates, and we are back to the ghoulish first half of the 20th century. European union is always on someone's ""terms"", and they rarely have much to do with consent. There is one difference today. Garton Ash may want ""the kind of budget, debt and wage discipline [Germany] has practised with such impressive results over the last decade, and now seeks for the whole eurozone"". It may be ""precisely what Europe needs"". But what Europe needs does not embrace the enforcement of what Germany would like to see. We might have said the same of the British empire in its heyday, that British discipline was ""what the peoples of India and Africa"" needed. We could mow them down when they disagreed. Germany has no panzer divisions, nor does it desire to dominate Europe politically, and without that desire there is no means of enforcement. The implied German supremacism of the EU's last-ditchers, under the euphemism of ""fiscal union"", is archaic, elitist, dangerous and mercifully impossible. The paradox is that this impossibility is to the credit of the postwar European movement itself. It has achieved what it set out to do, to liberate the nations of Europe from fear of German overlord-ship. This liberation has allowed France to walk proud, Britain to enjoy semi-detachment, Scandinavia to think for itself and middle Europe to breathe free. The EU lobby may have cobbled together institutions for a united states of Europe, but it was a fool's errand, and one that could only play into the hands of German revanchism. The tragedy is that the chosen vehicle of European union should have been a common currency. This ostensibly innocent tool is a weapon of mass economic destruction. It has imposed its clammy grip on divergent national economies, forcing hundreds of thousands of workers and their families to flee the ""overvalued"" countries of east and south Europe to seek work in the north. Others were kept at home only by government jobs funded by reckless foreign indebtedness. The reason was not just the fixing of the value of the euro to the Deutschmark, but the fixing of any weak currencies inflexibly to stronger ones. The resource cost of the euro over the past two decades must have been stupendous. A common currency as a means of imposing wage or fiscal discipline on uncompetitive states is a crude economic sanction. As with all sanctions, it corrupts and distorts domestic politics and makes electorates hostile to external pressure. To Eurocrats this hostility, like democracy itself, is a little local difficulty. But sooner or later, push comes to shove. Greeks and Italians are toppling leaders who fail to listen to them, and voters in Germany are threatening likewise. European political union, the universalist dream of visionaries, has met its Waterloo. Some confederacies have worked, such as the US, India and the United Kingdom (so far). But the EU was always a confection of elitist diplomacy, supported by Europe's peoples only for as long as they thought it would bring them money. It sought to craft a political entity from cultures whose differences have defied Hapsburgs, Bourbons, Napoleon and Hitler alike. Political union is a discredited orthodoxy and its advocates should retreat gracefully. The sensible route forward is not underpinning the euro at some new and temporary frontier, and ""kicking the can down the street"". It is for those states that sincerely wish to merge their political institutions with their neighbours – there must be precious few – to find common ground within the euro. Countries in southern Europe must recover their economic separateness and their political souls, writing off debts and devaluing their currencies, as Britain has done. Then Europe can find a new equilibrium. Metaphors of ""two-speed"" Europe, inner and outer clubs, and trains or planes being missed are meaningless. Nicolas Sarkozy and Angela Merkel are right, as is David Cameron. A new and more flexible constitution for Europe is blatantly needed. This constitution will be easier to define than to engineer. It must somehow retain the (overrated) gains of free trade, but accept that there will be many unlevel playing fields. The German Reichstag or Bundesbank cannot legislate for Greek labour laws, Italian opening hours or British tax havens. The currencies of less competitive states must float. The lash of devaluation and domestic austerity is one thing when self-imposed. When edicts emanate from unaccountable foreign agencies, as now in Greece and Italy, it is not. There could be no more disastrous last chapter to this sorry saga than the crude imposition of German ""discipline"" on the weaker members of the EU. Who would enforce it? Europe is a continent, not a panacea. It can no longer be seen as an ideological construct, whose adherents treat all challenge as an offence against infallibility. Historically, its strength has been its diversity, a high street not a hypermarket of nationalisms. Each time a centralised power has denied this and struggled to impose ""union"", the outcome has been catastrophe, followed by the need to restore and reassert the sovereignty of nations. This time round, the catastrophe has remained economic. It could yet be a near-run thing.",A new Europe must be built on the ruins of the old | Simon Jenkins,2011-11-10T21:30:01Z,Simon Jenkins,world
"Brilliance or buffoonery?"" wondered a Times headline of the Greek PM's policy ricochet this week. How about brainmelt, given the unfathomably intense pressure under which George Papandreou has been operating. Reports across the globe predict ""nervous breakdown"" in the eurozone, in governments, even in individuals. The leaders mime a strange pageant of stagily pointed fingers and decisive hand gestures for the benefit of the cameras, before releasing communiques best paraphrased as ""Errrrrrrrrrm..."". The hollow-eyed Nicolas Sarkozy now looks hollowed out. Even the previously unflappable-looking Angela Merkel looks ragged. They all appear close to the edge. Except for one man. Only one man appears to have the temperament to handle this crisis, the Teflon nerves to withstand any amount of pressure. Unfortunately, that man is Silvio Berlusconi. Watching the Italian prime minister leer and laugh his way through this week's Cannes summit, I'm reminded of the narrator's reflective words in The Big Lebowski: ""Sometimes there's a man … Sometimes there's a man – well, he's the man for his time and place. He fits right in there."" When historians search for the man who crystallised this age of reckoning, they will surely judge that man to have been Berlusconi. He is uniquely, almost enviably suited to handling crises – and simultaneously a creature whose grotesque buffoonery perfectly encapsulates the mess in which we find ourselves. Have you been watching him? Just as you can't take your eyes off a bad actor on a stage, and their badness somehow subsumes all the action, so Berlusconi is oddly mesmeric. Where is he now, I wonder of the Italian PM? How much of a plonker is he being now? Frequently, he will oblige me by popping up in the background of footage from the summit, appearing to be making a joke about his pen, or the Chinese. The only time he appeared to realise that a serious demeanour was required was during the red-carpet arrivals ceremony in Cannes on Thursday, but otherwise it has been business as usual. Last week, Berlusconi was filmed turning round after passing the Danish PM to take in her rear view. Then there he was again this week, checking out Argentinian president Cristina Fernandez. A visual caress of her backside, a suggestive readjustment of his tie – it's the look that says: ""I could scarcely be more concerned that Italian bond yields have reached critical levels."" Many leaders would find it somewhat sobering, this experience of attending the conference as leader of a country that everyone fears could be next to implode and take them with it. Instead, you get the overwhelming feeling that Berlusconi sees the gathering as a chance to take in some cabinet-level booty. Call it a wonga wonga party. How many hours' blissful sleep do you reckon he is getting a night? Nine? Ten? In many ways he's never looked better, if you squint past the ""work"" and the hair transplant. And bear in mind he's always dealing with the small matter of three criminal trials as well. Arguably the most memorable scene of recent weeks came in a joint Sarkozy-Merkel press conference, when the pair were asked if they'd been reassured by Signor Berlusconi's promises of action, and were unable to stem their smirks. What a terrifying glimpse of the historical stature of those who are supposed to be saving the world. Forgive me for adding to the pile of second world war analogies that have already been layered upon this crisis, but it momentarily seemed the equivalent of Churchill and Stalin giggling at Roosevelt at the Yalta conference, perhaps making bunny ears behind the president's head as they sat on the bench for that famous photo. The exchange angered a member of Berlusconi's party, who thought it was ridiculous that two leaders should be disrespecting him in this manner. To which the only reasonable reply was: well it's a lot less ridiculous than electing him, madam. And electing him so repeatedly. Berlusconi is Italy's longest-serving prime minister since the second world war, and many of us nurtured hopes that we might one day discover what precisely it was that he was doing right. Alas, that day might now be a pleasure indefinitely deferred. His country's debts are running at about 120% of GDP, and the prevailing wisdom is that Italy is too big to bail. Yet even Merkozy's failure to keep a straight face might be eclipsed on the vignette front by news that the crisis has forced a delay in the release of Berlusconi's fourth album of love songs. Popular myth has it that Nero called for his lyre as Rome burned; Berlusconi called for his karaoke mic. His longtime, guitar-playing collaborator explains that Berlusconi sends her the words and she sets them to music, which suggests the PM may actually have been addressing Italy's catastrophic finances by trying to find a rhyme for ""sexy time"". It's a shame, really, that he can't shag his way out of the problem. Still, at least he provides the tailspinning eurozone with a smutty spin on the old adage ""Cometh the hour, cometh the man"".

"Jeanette Winterson's memoir is written sparsely and hurriedly; it is sometimes so terse it's almost in note form. The impression this gives is not of sloppiness, but a desperate urgency to make the reader understand. This is certainly the most moving book of Winterson's I have ever read, and it also feels like the most turbulent and the least controlled. In the end, the emotional force of the second half makes me suspect that the apparent artlessness of the first half is a ruse; that, in a Lilliputian fashion, what appears to be a straight narrative of her early life is actually tying the reader down with a thousand imperceptible guy ropes, so that when she unleashes a terrible sorrow, there is no escaping it and no looking away. ""Why be happy when you could be normal?"" is the real-life question of her adopted mother, as Winterson is evicted, at 16, for taking up with a second girlfriend (the attempts to exorcise her sexuality after the first having been unsuccessful). There are passages and phrases that will be recognisable to anyone who's read Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit: this is not surprising, since that first, bold announcement of Winterson's talent was a roman à clef, and never claimed to be otherwise. So anecdotes and jokes crop up in both books: the mother says the lesbian sweet-shop owners deal in ""unnatural passions"", and the young Jeanette thinks it means they put chemicals in their sweets; the gospel tent, the CB radio, all the memorable details of the first fictional outing come up again, but the point is not that this is repetitive. Rather, that the documents are intended as companions, to lay this one over the last like tracing paper, so that even if the author poetically denies the possibility of an absolute truth, there emerges nevertheless the shape of the things that actually happened. I had forgotten how upbeat Oranges was; it may have been peopled by eccentrics, with a heroine held in alienation by the aspic of impotent childhood, but there were upsides. ""I suppose the saddest thing for me,"" Winterson writes now, ""thinking about the cover version that is Oranges, is that I wrote a story I could live with. The other one was too painful. I could not survive it."" The upbringing as she tells it now is far bleaker; she was beaten, she was often hungry, she was left all night on the doorstep by a mother whose religious excesses might even have been a secondary influence on the household the first being her depression, which was pervasive and relentless. She was not well loved. However, the story's leavened throughout by other observations. The geopolitics I sometimes found bold, and other times found too broad to be conclusive: ""In a system that generates masses, individualism is the only way out. But then what happens to community – to society?"" But it wriggles with humour, even as Jeanette describes Mrs Winterson, who, in between her violent homilies and dishonest violence, had like any good tyrant various crucial absurdities – ""she was one of the first women to have a heated corset. Unfortunately, when it overheated it beeped to warn the user. As the corset was by definition underneath her petticoat dress, apron and coat, there was little she could do to cool down except take off her coat and stand in the yard."" There is Winterson's quirky favourite hymn (""Cheer up ye saints of God,"" it starts, ""There is nothing to worry about""), her loving, impressionistic descriptions of classic authors, from TS Eliot to Gertrude Stein, as she first encounters them. And even with all this new, distressing detail, the story of her childhood ends well – it ends in escape. Then there's an odd page or two entitled ""Intermission"", which finishes: ""The womb to tomb of an interesting life – but I can't write my own; never could. Not Oranges. Not now. I would rather go on reading myself as a fiction than as a fact … I am going to miss out 25 years … Maybe later …"" And suddenly we are on to territory which is alarming, moving, at times genuinely terrifying; skip forward a quarter century, and Winterson has just split up from her girlfriend, the theatre director Deborah Warner. She finds her adoption papers in the effects of her dad, when he's moving to an old people's home. She has a nervous breakdown and attempts suicide. ""My friends never failed me and when I could talk I did talk to them. But often I could not talk. Language left me. I was in the place before I had any language. The abandoned place."" At times she describes the process with precision. Other times, though, the scars of this first abandonment are given in the most unadorned, uncharacteristic prose, as though she's trying to gnaw her way through her own sophistication to get to the truth of it. In a way, the presence in the narrative of Susie Orbach, with whom Winterson started a relationship just before she started looking for her birth mother, acts as a reassurance to the reader as much as to the author, a fixed point to whom we can return, whose very inclusion means that, whatever happens, a fresh abandonment won't be the outcome. Otherwise I genuinely think it would be unbearable. At one point I was crying so much I had tears in my ears. There is much here that's impressive, but what I find most unusual about it is the way it deepens one's sympathy, for everyone involved, so that the characters who are demons at the start – her adoptive mother but also, to a degree, her acquiescent adoptive father – emerge, by the end, as simply, catastrophically damaged. In the process of uncovering that, she painstakingly unpicks the damage they wreaked on her. The peace she makes with her adoptive family is, in this sense, more important and evocative than the more complicated and double-edged peace that comes with tracking down her birth mother.",Why Be Happy When You Could Be Normal? by Jeanette Winterson – review,2011-11-04T09:05:00Z,Zoe Williams,review
"The north always knows more about the south than the south does about the north. (In Britain, at least; the same may not be true of other longer-than-broad countries such as New Zealand or Italy.) The reasons are plain enough. London has long been the political and cultural capital, and is now the economic one as well. You may live in a Perthshire farmhouse and worry mainly about the price of sheep, but London will come dogging you as soon as you pick up a newspaper or turn on the TV. At one time, our Perthshire shepherd might have taken the memory of only one or two formal images back with him to the hill: Big Ben, say, or Her Majesty's coach ride up the Mall. But now London scenes appear in a turbulent variety: glamorous in the helicopter shots that introduce Sir Alan Sugar, ominous when Robert Peston does a piece to camera outside the Bank of England or Canary Wharf. Nor is this knowledge always or even mainly acquired secondhand. I'd guess, for example, that for every 10 people in southern England who have visited Scotland there would be at least 100 coming the other way. It follows, then, that Alex Salmond knows a great deal more about London (and England) than David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband do about Edinburgh (and Scotland), even if that brilliant trio's information were to be pooled. Until relatively recently, it seemed the natural order of things. The centre as a magnet to the periphery is a phenomenon common to many countries, though rarely has the magnet been so powerful or less centrally placed. I grew up with it. Though we lived several hundred miles to the north, we accepted London and the home counties as what you might call the default mode of the British experience. In black-and-white B features at the local cinema, detectives in big coats pursued murderers across countryside (probably Berkshire) that was unfamiliarly mellow with its copses, quaint pubs and rectories. On the radio, a magazine programme announced each week that it had brought ""the mighty roar of London's traffic"" to a halt. When I came to read Sons and Lovers I recognised the thrill that runs around the Morel household when Paul's older brother makes a trip home from the exciting metropolis, because I had a brother whose arrivals had the same effect. And when, in the 1960s, British culture became looser and more adventurous, and many more novels and films were set in the north, they were marked out by their difference as ""northern"", though nobody had described what had gone before as ""southern"". The south was the norm. I don't complain. It broadened the mind to live in two different places at once. Writers such as VS Naipaul were created out of much more extreme versions of this division – between what lay outside their door and a distant but dominant culture that didn't reflect it. Another writer, the Indian Nirad Chaudhuri, came to London for the first time aged 57 and found, as he one told me, that he could walk between Kensington and St Paul's ""without once asking for directions"", because so much of the city's geography had been absorbed from a lifetime's reading. It is possible, of course, to see us all, great and small, as victims of ""cultural imperialism"" (if watching Ealing comedies in Fife cinemas can be so described), but the bigger casualty is turning out to be the perpetrator who, never hearing much by way of return from the periphery and caring little about what it did hear, remained largely ignorant of what was going on. ""Most people living in England seem serenely unaware of what is happening,"" said a Guardian editorial this week on the swelling prospect of Scottish independence. Alex Salmond's adroit certainty met poor opposition in ""the muddled indifference of so much English opinion"", which needed to ""wake up and join the discussion before it's too late"". All these statements seem to me true, but workable constitutional remedies that would ensure the United Kingdom a future have never figured large in English political discussion. A federal system? Four national parliaments (including an English one), topped off by a federal assembly that held the ring and looked after foreign and defence policies? Outside a few fringe outfits and some old-fashioned Liberals, nobody has the appetite for it. It goes against a historic grain that combines ad-hocism (devolution is a good example) with a romantic English belief in Westminster as the most perfect system of government. Lurking under all this is the murky groundwater of English ignorance – perhaps more fairly described as a lack of curiosity. Scotland, at least when I was a schoolboy, took the British project seriously. I learned the dates of Agincourt and Crécy as well as Bannockburn and Culloden, and had as good an idea of Henry VIII and Elizabeth Fry as I did of Robert the Bruce and David Livingstone. But did it work the other way around? If you think of yourself as English, try these nine simple questions. 1 ""The wisest fool in Christendom"" was (a) John Knox, (b) James VI and I, or (c) the Earl of Bothwell, husband to Mary Queen of Scots? 2 Which of these dates marks a significant Scottish military defeat – (a) 1513, (b) 1314, or (c) 1297? 3 Who is the odd one out – (a) George Stephenson, (b) James Watt, or (c) Thomas Telford? 4 Which of these towns is northernmost – (a) Paisley, (b) Stirling, or (c) Perth? 5 Who wrote Sunset Song – (a) Alasdair Gray, (b) Lewis Grassic Gibbon, or (c) Hugh MacDiarmid? 6 How many years separated the union of crowns from the treaty of union – (a) 104, (b) 112, or (c) 98? 7 Who has the bigger memorial – (a) Robert Burns, or (b) Walter Scott? 8 The first British monarch (or consort) to wear a kilt was (a) Prince Albert, (b) George IV, or (c) Edward VII? 9 Would an independent Scotland's oil revenues compensate for the withdrawal of UK subsidy through the Barnett Formula – (a) yes, (b) no, or (c) depends who's counting? A good score will dent my belief that the flow of information in Britain is overwhelmingly one way; it may not dent it much, because Guardian readers tend to thoughtful and curious and I have 40-odd years of casual conversations in London to support my thesis that Scotland for many English people is no more than a place that prints funny sterling notes (though the days when they caused arguments with shop assistants and taxi drivers have long gone). In any case, here are the answers: 1 (b) 2 (a) – the battle of Flodden 3 (a) – Stephenson is the Englishman 4 (c) 5 (b) 6 (a) – from 1603 to 1707 7 (b) – the Scott monument in Edinburgh is probably the largest to any writer anywhere 8 (b) – on his visit to Edinburgh, with pink tights underneath 9 (c) – a proper calculation depending on production volumes, price per barrel, tax rates, etc",Do the English know anything about Scotland?

"It was the best of deals; it was the worst of deals. Now it is Germany waving a piece of paper declaring peace in our time. Now it is Germany taking the burden of what Angela Merkel, its leader, calls ""the worst crisis since the second world war"". Greece has defaulted by 50% on its debt. The afflicted banks are to be aided, and the wider eurozone is to be underpinned by a trillion-euro credit line, as yet obscure in origin. The euro, and with it the ramshackle, backfiring, gold-plated jalopy of European union, is back on the road, albeit without driver or map. The Greek default was necessary from the moment the euro was invented. The line may now be held, if sufficient growth can be stimulated fast enough to redeem the ever mounting debts. But a precedent has been set. If Italian or Spanish debts should prove unsustainable from the revenues of their citizens, the same crisis as afflicted Greece could overwhelm the new bailout fund. Socialist economies have proved the useful idiots of banker capitalism, piling liabilities on to future generations, like Gordon Brown's PFI hospitals. The day of reckoning has come, but not yet gone. Champions of the euro breathing sighs of relief deserve no sympathy. Since its launch in 1999 they knew this would happen. They knew the preconditions for a single currency – economic convergence and an enforceable ""stability and growth pact"" – were not in place. They knew that putting Europe back on a sort of gold standard would not bind national economies together into a single homogeneous powerhouse. As the uncompetitive members lurched into debt, they tut-tutted about sinfulness but did nothing. Instead the eurocrats waffled on about a solution lying with closer fiscal and political union, a sort of Holy Roman Empire reborn. They knew this was rubbish. Yet I have not detected an ounce of shame for the misery this policy has inflicted on the Greeks, and will soon inflict on the Italians and the Spanish. Youth unemployment is now 46% in Spain, fighting an estimated 30% overvaluation of Spanish output against Germany. The single currency is mad, and politically dangerous. What now? The cliche, in both Europe and America, is that the credit crunch has shown up a deficit in leadership comparable to that seen between the two world wars. But leadership derives from democracy, and that in turn derives from clearly delineated constitutions. Europe has been a constitutional shambles for half a century, with a widening gulf between its electorates and those taking increasingly intrusive decisions over them. The unpopular Lisbon treaty had to be enacted in the teeth of European public opinion. No British party had the nerve to put it to referendum. Push now comes to shove. Merkel spoke yesterday of what is needed to realise and entrench the rescue package. It was yet more Lisbon-style fantasy. She talked of imposing German überwachung, or political discipline, on the Greek public sector. How? When she and Nicolas Sarkozy smirked over Italy's inability to curb its spending, the message was clear. Something must be done about Italy. By whom? Merkel rejected a proper European central bank to bolster the single currency, but as France pointed out, how can a currency function without one? To Merkel all this meant ""a revision of the union treaties"" to reflect the new disciplines. The euro needs the support of a single fiscal regime, which would mean one European tax system, one inspectorate and one police to enforce it. It would in turn imply a single European social benefit regime, again somehow policed. It implies one government. From the start, this is what European unionists wanted, but wanting is not having. Merkel cannot be serious. There is no way a drastic increase in the central control of the European economy will gain support from national electorates. Nor will they accept that the European parliament offers sufficient accountability. People will not be further divorced from those who run their lives and fix their taxes. Were Germany and France to impose a single socioeconomic regime on all Europe as the price for a single currency, most governments that co-operated would be voted out of office. That is why Germany's demands will not be met. The politics will not sustain them. But if they are not to be met, what is the point of these crises, each one of which costs billions of euros and postpones the day when Europe's leaders can concentrate on growth rather than regret and redemption? As long as there is no united European state, there can be no united European currency. The euro may suit converged economies, like Germany's immediate neighbours, but it cannot be a tool of political suzerainty by Brussels over 17 diverse nations. Whatever the question, the euro is not the answer. The marginal states of the European Union must, like Britain, revert to floating exchange rates, to take the strain of different lifestyles and working practices. Britain had to learn that painfully when Churchill adopted the gold standard in 1924. After the war Britain tied itself to the dollar and suffered. After it broke free in the 1970s it prospered. No amount of ""pro-Europe"" platitudinising will find jobs for millions of unemployed workers who are the euro's victims round the Mediterranean basin. No amount of patronising analysis will turn Italian farmers or Spanish fishermen into German technicians. The differences between states must be reflected in their terms of exchange. This is not a matter of being ""pro- or anti-Europe"". It is why the eurozone must find a way to a ""managed shrink"". America has precious few messages to give Europe just now, but one is as old as the republic itself. It is that constitutions matter in confederacies. The rights and duties between related states matter. It matters how a supranational government orders a subordinate one. Sovereign assemblies must know where they stand. Voters, too, must know where they stand. Constitutions must reflect and respect tiers of responsibility or voters will rise up and defy them. The dream of a fused Europe, like that of one America, was noble after the horrors of the 20th century. But it was unrealisable as envisaged. It instead morphed into a sanctimonious, mono-cultural elitism, dominated by the bankers and bureaucrats that have brought it to the present pass. At first the EU was just a mildly corrupt way of shuffling taxpayers' money round the continent. Under monetary union after 1999 it went both reckless and rigid. It has snapped, yet its apologists have nothing better to offer than bromides about budgetary discipline and fiscal union. Europe is a confederation that needs a working constitution. But it needs one detoxified of ""ever closer union"". There must be clear boundaries of sovereign discretion. Members should be able to trade with each other free of the shackles of politico-economic union, even if the result is many un-level playing fields. The nation states of Europe must have legislative space to breathe free. That is what a new constitution should offer. We were a million miles from it today.","EU bailout: In trying to save the euro, Germany is making demands that cannot be met | Simon Jenkins",2011-10-27T21:00:11Z,Simon Jenkins,world
"The posters are still up, showing the face of Gilad Shalit, the boy soldier freed last week after five years hidden in the dark. ""How good it is to have you back home,"" runs the slogan, appearing on the side of shopping malls in Tel Aviv and on lampposts in Jerusalem. Shalit's return has enabled Israelis to walk with an unaccustomed spring in their step, despite their fear that the price was dreadfully high. It should go without saying that Israelis would have preferred a one-to-one exchange, releasing a single Palestinian prisoner, rather than more than a thousand – many of them guilty of horrendous acts of violence – in return for Shalit. But, contrary to what some have suggested, it was Hamas, not Israel, that set that 1:1000 exchange rate; it was Hamas, not Israel, who decided that the freedom of a single Israeli was worth the freedom of a thousand Palestinians. Yet the boost at Shalit's return is unlikely to last long. Just as the sight of his emaciated face and sunken eyes on every front page confirms that the damage of his captivity will haunt him for years, so Israelis who yearn for the security that can only come with an accommodation with their neighbours know there is no remedy imminent for them either. Except now the familiar pessimism comes with a twist. While their own government has next to no strategy to resolve the conflict, it is now the Palestinians, so often buffeted by events, who have a plan and are pursuing it. The problem is that both strategies, old and new, are insufficient. Start with the Israeli position. A series of conversations with senior figures in the Israeli government reduces to a single public message: Israel wants to return to direct talks with the Palestinians without preconditions. What's more, colleagues of the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, point to a series of statements and signals, overlooked by both the Palestinians and world opinion, which indicate that, if Netanyahu were engaged in a serious face-to-face process, he would push for a genuine agreement. One well-placed insider said that in the prime minister's office the man with the highest hopes for negotiations is the prime minister himself, imagining that, when it came to it, he and Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas could make a breakthrough: ""He puts himself in the other guy's shoes, thinking that 'maybe he'll take the jump with me'."" To that end, the Netanyahu team tells me, they have repeatedly sought to draw Abbas into talks. Every attempt has been rebuffed, they say, ""the door slammed in our face"". There are multiple problems with this account, but they all come down to a single word: credibility. For every encouraging smoke signal sent out by Netanyahu – aides mention his talk of ""creativity"" in resolving the radioactive issue of Jerusalem – there is at least one telegraphing an opposite message, often in the very same paragraph: that promise of ""creativity"", for example, came with a warning that Jerusalem must forever remain the undivided capital of Israel, thereby closing the door on a key Palestinian demand. Nothing renders Netanyahu's offers of peace talks less credible to Palestinian ears than settlement building. I saw for myself the expansion of, among other places, the town of Beitar Illit across the Green Line that separates pre-1967 Israel from the West Bank. With some 35,000 residents, Beitar Illit now hems in the Palestinian village of Wadi Fukin, choking off all future growth. Israelis say that such building does not connote bad faith: almost all of it is under way in blocs that will ""inevitably"" be allocated to Israel in any eventual peace deal – in return for land from inside Israel-proper – and that in previous negotiations Palestinians have conceded as much. But such thinking breaks a necessary rule of peacemaking: one side cannot bank concessions by the other until the entire deal is done. And no deal was done. Until it is, expanding settlements in occupied territory – recognised as illegal by almost every country except Israel – is bound to undermine any call for the Palestinians to come to the table. As Husam Zomlot, a senior figure in Fatah, put it to me in Ramallah: ""You can't have discussions about how we are going to share a pizza, while one side is eating the pizza."" This is a problem that predates Bibi. Palestinians say this has been the story of the 18 years since the Oslo accords of 1993: endless on-and-off talks, while the material facts on the ground – from new roads to restrictions on access and movement – change and the settler population more than trebles. It is this which, above all, makes the call to resume talks not credible to Palestinian ears: why should they sit around talking for another 18 years, watching as more of their land is nibbled away? Accordingly, the Palestinians have devised another strategy. They plan to rely no longer on direct negotiations which they believe are hopelessly asymmetric, the power tilted so heavily in Israel's favour. Those I spoke to insist there is no plan to return to violence, believing that the second intifada, with its suicide bombings of Israeli buses, pizzerias and discos, proved totally counterproductive – triggering an Israeli military response that rolled back not the occupation but most of the gains the Palestinians had made in the previous decade, destroying much that had been built up. The new Palestinian strategy will involve neither ""armed struggle"", nor a return to ""meaningless, open-ended negotiations"". Instead it will try to deploy other tools. The first is ""internationalisation"", seeking to change the Israel-Palestine conflict from a bilateral dispute between the two parties into a problem for the world community to resolve: hence last month's statehood application to the UN and a current request to join Unesco. The aim is to ratchet up international pressure to such a degree that when the two sides do eventually return to the table – and Zomlot is adamant that ""without negotiations this conflict can never end"" – they will be, if not equally powerful, then closer to parity than ever before. And there could be an additional pressure. There is hopeful talk of a ""Palestinian spring"", a popular movement demanding independence that world opinion would find hard to oppose, one inspired by the first, stone-throwing intifada begun in 1987 rather than by the murderous second one that began in 2000. Such an uprising would also put pressure on the Israeli government to make the concessions necessary for peace, much as the first intifada pushed Israel into the Madrid and Oslo processes. There are problems here too, starting with the fact that the first target of a Palestinian spring could well be the unreformed, still-corrupt Palestinian Authority – and that an initially nonviolent effort risks spiralling out of control. As for internationalisation, just as years of talks have not brought Palestinian independence, countless UN resolutions have not achieved much tangible for the Palestinians either. One diplomat says the old Israeli strategy and the new Palestinian one boils down to this: the Israelis want a process but no peace, the Palestinians want peace but no process. That may be glib, but it's clear both strategies are incomplete. What's needed is either for Netanyahu, if he is serious, to make a gesture large and surprising enough to overcome Palestinian suspicion and render him credible – or for the international community to take charge of a refashioned peace process, gripping it the way London and Dublin oversaw the Northern Ireland negotiations.

As in we have not opened a boxset since putting Justine in the cabinet, because the boys went mental, obvs, and Dave says she totes ruined the initiation ceremony by screaming nonstop, even though Hammy was fine and Oik had picked her an incredibly small toad. In the end Govey had to eat it, to set an example, and after, Dave was like, Hilto is it just me or what is the point of equal rights if women won't step up to the plate, and Hilto was like, dude, don't get me started. Then it was the first meeting of Hilto's Female Understanding and Communication Directorate which is called Fucd for short, and Dave went what DO women want, Haguey first, and Haguey went is not chocolate scientifically proven to sedate them and Hunty went no, I know for a fact it is cupcakes, and Hammy said he still swears by chardonnay then Justine went excuse me, it is jobs actually, I mean total tactfulness fail? But because she is female Hilto had to go haha, brilliant, what Justine wants Justine gets, who could resist those beautiful eyes? So Mary Portas was like – beautiful? – frankly they make me want to puke, and Tamara went OMG, listen to Helen of Troy, and Anya went, hello? ever heard of SIGNATURE BAGS anyone? Then Dave's iPhone lit up and it was the Siri person and it said what women want is 1) to marry money 2) no VAT on fish pedicures, and 3) a hereditary peerage for Emma Kitchener-Fellowes.

"The question is, when al fresco Cabinet Office minister Oliver Letwin dumps government papers in the park bin, does Adam Werritty sidle along later and fish them out? Who knows at this stage, but it has been a week in which it has become possible to begin enjoying certain aspects of this government. When the grimmest financial unknowns are battering at the door, there is great comfort to be had in sitting back to enjoy a classic old-fashioned defence scandal with a side order of innuendo. Sling another chair leg on the fire, and let's hope that some tear in the scandal continuum will see the bin story collapse into the rather more radioactive buddy movie that is Defence Secretaries Like Us. Convergence is possible. After all, both Letwin and the newly resigned Liam Fox have starred in one of those idiosyncratic Tory burglaries. Letwin once let a young man into his house to use the loo at five in the morning, only for the little tinker to rob him, causing the then shadow home secretary to pursue him clad in only a bathrobe. It now seems a burglary at Fox's flat last year had elements of the obscure, in that Conservative officials apparently felt moved to conceal from journalists that a man (not Werritty) had been staying in Dr Fox's spare room at the time. It takes one back, really, this sense that the cabinet are a bunch of chaps with a range of eccentricities and appetites upon which they are conducting a doomed struggle to keep a lid. It somehow has a different quality to the Blair years, where the scandals involved dreary things like passports or visa applications or property deals; or horrors such as the death of David Kelly. To my mind, there were two unexpungeable black marks against Liam Fox. The first was his fondness for Dubai, a place he and Werritty met five times since the election. I'm afraid the world can be divided into people with whom one would care to spend any time, and people who like Dubai. The second and more alarming black mark was the defence secretary's sensational ineptitude as a strategist. Dr Fox might have viewed each day's survival as a battle won in his war – as might his allies – but in fact it was the opposite. David Cameron played this perfectly, allowing the darling of the rightwingers to cling on for the full media evisceration. Had Fox resigned on Monday with some huffy but terse statement about having made mistakes and not wanting to distract from the government's vital work, he would have gone to the backbenches bloodied but unbroken, where he would have remained a low-level threat and might even – in the meltdown that may occur when those financial unknowns batter down the door – have seen serious anti-Cameron support coalesce around him. But his insistence on remaining in post allowed the prime minister to watch with a face set to ""fair and sympathetic"", as an old rival was more irredeemably damaged with each new revelation. Fox's apparent inability to see that this was what was happening to him was most diverting for the rest of us, though would have been less so had he been defence secretary at the time of the cold war, when rather more first-class game theorists were required. Of course, we had an inkling of the ex-defence secretary's dimness last year, when he felt moved to make a statement saying he was ""disgusted and angry"" at the ""thoroughly un-British"" latest edition of the Medal of Honor computer game series, which was set in Afghanistan. According to the MoD, ""he wanted to comment on this as it's part of the wider picture of defence"". What a mind he is. I suppose there was a chance the defence secretary might have survived but even if he had, the former GP would have been reduced to the level at which one always sensed the Cameron toffs felt he belonged. To the upper classes, as I wrote in a column about Fox last year, being a GP is almost akin to being a servant. The doctor is certainly not a friend, more someone one has to keep around in case one gets shingles. You give him a middling bottle of whisky at Christmas, and might ask him to make up a bridge four if someone had flu, but you'd have no hesitation in reminding him of his place. Thus Fox has now been restored to his rightful position in Cameron's model village. It's difficult to decide which was more devastating for him – the vote of confidence from the PM or his having been disowned by Natalie Imbruglia, the erstwhile popstar once romantically ""linked"" to him in rumours he battled bravely not to stop. ""Please!"" sniffed Imbruglia at the opening of some envelope this week. ""He's a friend of my manager."" Perhaps all that remains in this imbroglio is to see how far the bonds of Fox's remarkable friendship will stretch. Should he find himself forced to make a high-level visit to the dole office, will Mr Werritty be spotted queueing behind him, before whispering stagily to the benefits adviser that he is there ""in a private capacity""?",Liam Fox's strange tale has been of great comfort in these dark times | Marina Hyde,2011-10-14T16:33:04Z,Marina Hyde,politics
"I usually wake at 5.30, which is earlier than I like but gives me two uninterrupted hours of work before the day begins. However, at the end of the month the government will make me wake at 4.30, which I find miserably early. Then, when I have grown used to treating 4.30 as 5.30, the government will next April tell me to wake at 6.30. This is crazy. If lighter evenings are a good idea in the summer, why not in the winter, when there is less light and when the contentious northern mornings are dark anyway? For many people I know, perhaps even for most, sleep is their biggest bugbear. Night-time torments them. They cannot sleep without addictive pills, or suffer broken nights, or wake too early, or are tortured by the cries of babies, the snores of partners or the rowdyism of neighbours. They change mattresses, read novels, punch pillows, jog, drink whisky, count sheep, make love, anything to find sleep. All the therapies in the world seem unable to chart a path from consciousness to Shakespeare's ""death of each day's life, sore labour's bath, the balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course"". So why does government make things worse by constantly shortening the pleasure or prolonging the pain? Why keep the nation in a state of perpetual jet lag? The home secretary, whom I take to be responsible, is like a demented regimental sergeant major, asserting authority by ordering the company on parade to perform something stupid. British summer time is no ancient tradition but, like many dictatorial novelties, a creature of war. It was proposed in 1915 by a house-builder, William Willett, to give himself an extra hour to play golf, and was taken up by Winston Churchill to save coal during the great war. Since the benefit, at least to golfers, weakened in October, ""real time"" was resumed for the winter, even if it meant lighting-up time was earlier. Since then, the annual changing of the clocks has become one of the ritual persecutions that government visits on citizens as if to atone for original sin – like airport security, criminal record checks and quarterly VAT returns. When I questioned a Heathrow guard on his need to body-search an old man in a wheelchair, he turned political philosopher: ""It's just to show who's boss."" The Wilson government briefly ended the changing of the clocks in 1968 and experimented with three years of standard time. The Scots lobbied to end it, fighting for a reversion to dark afternoons on the basis of suspect accident figures, to punish the English for making them live so far north. Though the statistics were complicated by a simultaneous change in drink-driving law, 1,000-2,000 deaths and serious injuries were saved by lighter evenings. It patently made sense to maximise the amount of daylight available for work and play by the maximum number of people. Standard time, of GMT-plus-one, tallied with safety, energy conservation, recreation and the appreciation of beauty. It also conformed to the rest of western Europe. Reversing the gains of standard time would normally have caused apoplexy to health-and-safety. Yet the slaughter was regarded by the Scots as a necessary blood sacrifice to the forces of Presbyterian gloom. Despite a clear preference by English people for standard time, Scots MPs have filibustered every subsequent attempt in parliament to restore it. To them, God-fearing (Scottish) people deserved lighter mornings than evenings, when there was a danger of such licentious behaviour as people walking in parks after work, playing football or enjoying the open air. The Scots should be left to do what they want with their clocks. It is their business. If it causes problems along the border, they are ones that are solved with equanimity between the time zones of Russia, America and Australia. But in this matter the London dog is wagged by the Edinburgh tail. The concession to opinion north of the border was driven largely by English anti-devolution sentiment, clock-changing being a price thought worth paying (in death and destruction) to keep the union together. When people worked by hand, they did so in daylight and slept in darkness. In his intriguing new history of the night, Evening's Empire, Craig Koslofsky points out that ""nocturnalisation"" arrived when idle pleasures moved from day to evening, largely as a sign of wealth. Night was traditionally associated with wrongdoing, evil, the devil and witchcraft. When most people could not afford clocks or oil lamps to show the passage of time, night was full of insomniac terror. The sleepless did not know how long they might have to lie awake before the salvation of dawn. Nor, thanks to the mumbo-jumbo of dream-readers (and later of Freud), did they know what horrors might be revealed if they returned to slumber. John Donne regarded midnight as the moment when the atheist should arise alone, ""hear God and ask then … is there a God? And, if thou darest, say no."" This changed with the 17th century, when houses and streets were lit, clocks became widespread, indoors enjoyment was safe and exclusive, and revelry could extend into the night. To stay up late became smart and risqué, if unproductive. Night was when the gains of the day were frittered away, when the gap between rich and poor widened. The rich going home would pass the poor going to work. Nowadays the divide is as much between young and old. It is known that older people and those charged with adrenaline, such as Margaret Thatcher, need less sleep. The columnist Bernard Levin wrote of his foolproof cure for insomnia, which was to get up. The former prime minister John Major used to read the first editions of the morning papers before going to bed, ensuring himself a miserable night and an equally miserable awakening. Teenagers, as every parent knows, are mutating into vampires, sleeping by day and roaming the streets by night. They seem unable to rise from their beds when the sun is high, or close their eyes in hours of darkness. We remain ambivalent about the night. We equate retiring early to bed with virtue, with making us ""healthy, wealthy and wise"". The workaholic Benjamin Franklin remarked that the early morning ""has gold in its mouth"". We declare an hour of sleep before midnight to be worth two after it, and regard a good night as ""the sleep of the just"". Yet we accept such inanities as putting the clocks back in October as if it were a hallowed medieval ceremony, an autumn ritual of reaping, harvesting, filling barns and raking dead leaves. Changing the time terminates the summer and its pleasures with darkness at teatime. It bids us go home and care for our own. It is a relic of the austerity of war, like rationing, Dad's Army and utility clothes, but one that was never carried to its logical conclusion, that Greenwich mean time was always an hour behind. Because government said clock-changing was good, it was assumed to be so, even if it is totally mad.",Why fiddle with our clocks?

"Like many other ignorant Lowlanders, I have only ever really encountered the Gaelic language when drink has been taken. At that time of the year when the National Mod occurs, I have occasionally lingered at the television channel covering it and permitted the sound of a clàrsach and a poem sung in the cadences of the old language to send me to sleep and thus finish what the Guinness and the Bacardis had started. Then it is easy to imagine that this language is the native tongue of the Garden of Eden. Once, on a scrofulous night out with a Gaelic-speaking broadcaster, I found myself promising this gentle man that I would sign up for a six-month course in his language. But not before he had to endure my all-too predictable and sodden attempts at impersonating the pitch and swell of his lyrical delivery. Those whom we encountered on our alcoholic peregrination that evening may well have felt that I was indeed bilingual as my sentences became suffused with rum. On too many occasions, I have given vent to those other uninformed attitudes that characterise many of my fellow Scots when talking about ""the Gaelic"": we spend too much money on promoting it; like Latin and Greek, there is a time to die so let's just put it to sleep and have done with it. What in the name of the Lord have we been thinking of? Not many more than 50,000 people speak Gaelic and, if we do not intervene properly in the course of the next five years, the language will surely die. If we reach such a point, then this generation of Scots will have been complicit in a grievous act of folly. Something of Scotland's soul and essence will have been destroyed. Not many other countries have their very own ancient tongue and one which carries some of the most beautiful music, poetry and prose in Scotland's bounty. Nor would many other countries have neglected, cursed and scorned a language such as this in the manner that we have. Last week, a survey released by the second National Gaelic Language Plan revealed that if the number of children attending primary one in our Gaelic medium schools doesn't double to 800 in the next six years then we might as well turn off the life-support machine right now. Around 1,000 elderly Gaelic speakers die each year and the language is perishing with them right before our eyes. At present, our government grants £5m to Bòrd na Gàidhlig which it disburses to more than 200 organisations tasked with promoting the language and its culture. In real terms, £5m is the square root of fuck all and wouldn't keep a school in jotters and books for more than a few terms. Much was made of the decision to grant BBC Alba, the Gaelic language TV channel, a digital broadcasting licence. But having given birth we are now effectively orphaning it. It limps along on an annual grant of £12m while its Welsh cousin receives around £100m. Why does this matter? Shouldn't we be more concerned about the scandalously meagre uptake of modern languages in our schools? These, after all, will equip our children better to endure and thrive in our global society. What sort of perverse logic is it that states that we cannot learn the languages of other nations without neglecting our own? Recent academic research on Gaelic education has consistently shown that Gaelic-speaking pupils outperform their peers in the study of English and achieve parity in most other subjects. For the Gaelic language gentiles such as me it is probably too late. And so some of the treasures of Iain Crichton Smith, Sorley MacLean and Aonghas MacNeacail must remain behind a veil; you can never experience the pleasure of driving a Bentley just by listening to those who have. But why also deny our children? Many of us are fond of believing that Gaelic is merely a language spoken by melancholic old Highlanders who like to sing about fishing tragedies and the Clearances after a few bottles of the Macallan. This, though, is the language that was spoken by Scottish kings and was considered by the English as such a dangerous source of seditious pride and unity in the face of slavery and conquest that they outlawed it. The songs and poems sung in this tongue expressed an entire people's determination to remain Scottish and free when others would possess us. To appreciate and learn this language is to understand something of what our nation is: its culture, its identity, its soul. Why would we willingly let this die for the want of even modest investment? The SNP is proposing to introduce a new academic course called Scottish studies to the curriculum. It has already attracted the by-now predictable and untutored opprobrium from Scottish Labour that we have come to expect from that most unimaginative of political parties. If the government thinks this through properly, the Scottish Studies syllabus could provide a lifeline for Gaelic. And for those who would yet insist on putting a price on the salvation of our language the cost would not be prohibitive. A wide-ranging, rewarding and challenging course could include an introduction to Gaelic for every first- and second-year pupil in Scotland. This would include speaking a little of the language and learning about Gaelic culture, art and history. If even just 1% went on to further study and felt encouraged to send their children to a Gaelic medium school then this, Scotland's real native language, could yet be preserved. Mike Russell, our education minister, is also a convert to the Gaelic cause and may yet consider pursuing this idea. ""This is almost a human rights issue, for language is an expression of who people are. It would be so beneficial to our children to give them even just a taste of the riches of Gaelic language and culture,"" he told me. Few people love the eagles and the swans and the corncrakes and the beavers more than me, but if we're happy to invest many millions in securing the future of our great beasties, then surely we can do the same for our living language.",It would be unspeakable to lose Gaelic | Kevin McKenna,2011-10-08T23:02:02Z,Kevin McKenna,uk
"Everyone keeps asking how I survived but I am like, seriously, Manchester is quite adorbs if you're exploring a downturny but fighty kind of vibe which is basically what A/W politics 2011 is all about?

"Doesn't George Monbiot own his house? One large enough to accommodate two tenants as well as the environmentalist? Is there not also an attractive, sea-going kayak? No sooner had my admirable co-worker detailed his income and savings last week, in what he hopes will become a register of journalists' interests, than commentators began itemising omissions which might also, they contend, influence the way we assess his work. How about book royalties? And his pension, if any? ""Your pension is an investment,"" one reader reminded Mr Monbiot. ""Who have you invested your money with?"" Let's not forget, either, the elastic notion of a ""friend"", from whom, in this register, gifts and services need not be declared, nor the value of social perquisites, such as mixing with influential people. And what of the food in the Monbiot larder, not to mention books, shoes, furniture, electronic equipment, toiletries and possibly inherited items from a family which was – we note – of the upper-middle class persuasion? Although you can't put an exact price on being a posh boy from a la-di-dah school (Stowe) and a swank university (Oxford), various commentators thought these, too, should definitely form part of an overall assessment of the Monbiot mindset. Can a privately educated person ever earn the right to protect the icecaps? As Monbiot had anticipated, some – including me – concluded that, cash per para, he represents brilliant value; others sneered at the ""silly money"" that, as one elegantly put it, allows him to ""twat about worrying about the state of the planet"". It proved scant consolation to the frugal camp that, reading him online, they had not contributed a penny towards his upkeep. Given this peerless illustration of what it means to be damned if you do, damned if you don't, it is hard to imagine Monbiot's register catching on, even among the hacks – there must be some – who are similarly proud not to be corrupted by multinationals whose interests they covertly promote under the guise of providing robust and objective commentary. Undoubtedly, there are grounds for reform – Monbiot mentions the great philosopher Roger Scruton's stipend from Japan Tobacco – but it is a pity that his proposals for exposing the morally compromised are now likely to be dismissed by detractors along with his insistence on pay transparency, as an outbreak of classic Moonbat Utopianism. Like Ivan Lewis's eccentric proposal for striking off media malefactors, Monbiot's suggestion that being paid to write is, of itself, a faintly whiffy arrangement, one suspect enough to need confessing, is an extreme response to a real problem. Of course journalists need to protect their collective reputation from the deliberate chancers, frauds and liars who have been surfacing in the most unlikely places. As it is, by making Scandinavian-style personal disclosure the price of journalistic respect, Monbiot has transformed one campaign into another, against privacy. ""I have opened this register because I believe that journalists should live by the standards they demand of others,"" he explains. No one could quarrel with that. But, with the excellent exception of Polly Toynbee, who has disclosed her own salary, how many journalists do, in reality, demand that all employees reveal their earnings? The people subject to these demands will be either alleged rogues or accountable to shareholders (or both) or paid with public money, as with MPs, MEPs, peers, civil servants, David Cameron's special advisers, doctors, BBC employees, quangocrats, doctors, policemen, PFI profiteers, the royal family and the needy, multitudinous bankers who now survive on our charity. Naturally, it is the standard retort from all the above, when they are subjected to unwelcome inspection that, outrageously, journalists are never exposed in this way. Or only when the journalists are also politicians. The revelation that the Times used to pay Michael Gove £1,000 for the product of ""an hour a week"" still gives many of us hope. In 2009, after Toynbee's candour impressed a Commons inquiry into top public pay, the MP Gordon Prentice tabled an early day motion urging ""journalists, broadcasters, commentators, politicians and others to follow her example before pronouncing on pay levels in the public sector by first disclosing their own income, earned and unearned"". If I can say so without first supplying a recent bank statement and utility bill, Mr Prentice's wilful refusal to recognise the difference between public and private funds is no more attractive than his apparent sympathy with the Daily Mail position, to the effect that anyone can be defined by a house price and no prosperous non-hypocrite could ever hold liberal views. Supposing his suasions had worked, at what point would commentators' salaries become so outrageous that they vitiated an opinion on, say, council executives' pay, as talked up by state-funded consultants? Happily for Ed Miliband, of Primrose Hill, Prentice has not as yet demanded full property valuations from anyone planning to comment, de haut en bas, on life's unfairness. It was a token, apparently, of the leader's renewed fire that he wants to ""end the cosy cartels of the way top pay is set"", to which end he intrepidly proposes an employee on every pay committee. The contention from more ambitious opponents of injustice is that the obscene gulf between the highest and lowest salaries will never be addressed until it is exposed by the end of all secrecy on pay. The most equal societies are the most open. And maybe the initial glee, shock and fury would, as predicted, subside; salaries would be compressed and we would all be happier, even in trades as unpredictable as journalism, where it would take much more than privilege, nepotism or illicit discrimination to explain why, say, a person who makes up horoscopes can earn 10 times as much as a Monbiot. But the psychology is unclear. To judge by the small number of successful women who put their names to feminist campaigns for pay transparency, openness about salaries may be about as appealing to the British public as is 60% Scandinavian-style taxation. Impossible as it might seem, greater pay transparency might prompt, in the absence of greater redistribution, discontent rather than harmony – witness the unhappy footballers and writers who have smarted, as the noble AS Byatt unforgettably did, when a showier rival was publicly awarded what Monbiot's critics call ""silly money"". ""He must believe that his name is so extraordinary that anyone will pay an extra £250,000 to have him on their list,"" said Byatt in 1995 when, by being paid like a lawyer, Martin Amis made everyone jealous. She might, as a writer, have rejoiced at the recognition. Instead: ""I always earn out my advances and I don't see why I should subsidise his greed, simply because he has a divorce to pay for and has just had all his teeth re-done."" Journalists are no different. At the time of writing, I can find no colleagues emulating the Monbiot register. But for thinking it up, at all, its creator surely deserves a big fat bonus.","Even if you show me yours, I'm not showing you mine | Catherine Bennett",2011-10-01T23:07:05Z,Catherine Bennett,uk
"There is no argument. The Liberal Democrats and their leader, Nick Clegg, have played a political blinder this past 18 months. They have kept a British coalition government in being against all odds, with no sign of it collapsing in the near future. Nor have the Lib Dems just sustained a regime, as they did some governments, Tory and Labour, in the 1920s and 1970s. They have palpably had a restraining influence on it. They deserve recognition at least for this. Before the 2010 election Clegg was hailed by the Westminster pundits as a Churchill, an Obama, an agenda-setter, a ""weather-changer"". He was ""the most exciting politician in Britain"", who would fly high at the polls and determine the course of a hung parliament. He would change the rules of the game. Like most punditry, this was drivel. I wrote at the time, ""Poor Nick Clegg: this is as good as it gets."" History showed that coalitions rarely survive, and centre parties that prop up one or other extreme tend to meet horrible fates. Hung parliaments might delight electoral reformers, but they aid only minority parties with specific demands, such as Jewish settlements, Bavarian autonomy or hand-outs to friends. When the arithmetic of parliament gives them a hand, the British Liberals have lacked a defining agenda beyond the ambition of their leaders. When they dallied with power, as under David Steel in 1978, it spelled disaster. I gave Clegg's deal with David Cameron two years, at the most. I expect to be wrong. The party has certainly lost almost 700 councillors in local elections and dropped to single figures in the polls. Clegg, who has made a decent fist of the dire job of deputy prime minister, has been ridiculed. The media regularly catalogues the humiliations and defeats to which his party has been subjected. But all this was predictable (and predicted). It obeyed the iron law of coalitions. What history should find astonishing is that Clegg is still there. His chief lieutenants, Vince Cable, Danny Alexander and Chris Huhne, are still in office, commanding important areas of government. They have nudged the NHS, the universities, school grants, penal policy, energy policy, Europe and abortion in directions not normally associated with Tory governments. Much of their influence may have been barmy, such as Huhne's inflationary energy pricing. But nobody could describe the Lib Dems as invisible coalition partners. Thanks to the tact of Cameron and the deftness of Clegg, the Lib Dems have held the cabinet roughly to the terms of last year's coalition manifesto. The parliamentary party has not split or seen serious defections, as coalition parties normally do. There has been no ""ministers' party"" and backbenchers' party. Clegg retains the support and respect of his MPs and most of his constituencies, even when he cannot offer potentially rebellious MPs the promise of office. He and they know they face probable annihilation at the next election. Yet for all the rumblings at the Birmingham conference, like Cathars at Montségur, the Lib Dems face death with discipline. They even discuss it in public. Their popular president, Tim Farron, spoke on Monday of the party's ""nerves of steel"" and of its ministers as participants in a coalition marriage that was ""witless, a nightmare and doomed to end in divorce"" well before the next election. This was brutal but honest. While it might horrify the 18 Lib Dems now drawing ministerial salaries, few strategists can see the party entering the next election other than detached from their Tory colleagues. A 1918-style ""coupon election"", with Tories standing aside in winnable Lib Dem seats and vice versa, is inconceivable. After four years in government the strains within the coalition are likely to be intense. A divorce would seem kind, and in the best interests of both parties in the runup to an election. Clegg must somehow engineer a disagreement of principle on which to stage a pre-election separation. This makes the intellectual timidity of the Lib Dems in government all the more curious. Why have they been so silent on Cameron's wars? Where are they on the planning reforms, which have left even many Tories mystified and angry? Why are they so lukewarm on localism and hostile to drug law reform? The party accepted the odium of higher ""tuition fees"", yet failed to take any credit for turning the fees into what they are, a graduate tax. Most baffling of all has been the idiosyncratic course plotted by the party's Gandalf, Vince Cable. While his acerbic attacks on bankers have gone down well on the doorstep, he has failed to make them bite where they should, in the City. Harping on about bonuses and executive pay without doing anything about either has merely emphasised his impotence as industry secretary. The banks' lobbyists ran rings round him and Cameron on the Vickers proposals for investment banking, which are now lost in distant long grass. As for Cable's obsession for ""quantitative easing"" as the preferred vehicle for aiding recovery, he does not seem to know what it is. Like BBC newsreaders, he parrots the cliche that easing is ""to kick-start the economy"", yet after billions of pounds have rolled off the government printing presses, easing has totally failed in this goal. Theory holds that buying bonds from banks is supposed to channel cash into lending, and thus into spending. It does no such thing, because at present the banks use the cash to pay off their gambling debts. Yet when challenged to stimulate more immediate growth, the best Cable can offer is to ""bring forward"" some grand construction projects. The Lib Dems have signed up to the same ""toff economics"" as obsessed Gordon Brown, Alistair Darling and now George Osborne. This relied for recovery not on giving money to consumers in tax cuts and benefit increases but on giving it to banks and builders. It sought to stimulate demand by giving money not to those who might spend in the high street but to institutions that would not, backed up with halfhearted City speeches about ""boosting loans to businesses"" that were going bankrupt for lack of customers. The Lib Dems seem to bring no new ideas to this table, from left or right of the policy spectrum. They have pulled off a remarkable political coup, offering the country stable leadership at a time of economic turbulence. But as to finding a way out of that turbulence, they remain intellectually barren.

"Do the rich and powerful ever sink? After an explosion wrecked the Deepwater Horizon rig last year, killing 11 workers, nearly 5m barrels of oil gushed into the Gulf of Mexico over the following three months. It was the biggest marine oil spill in history – an environmental catastrophe with effects that will be felt for many years. BP, to whom the rig was under contract, set up a $20bn (£12.6bn) fund to compensate the victims, selling assets as it watched its share price tumble. City and Wall Street rumours suggested BP couldn't survive. The company's chief executive, Tony Hayward, came to be vilified across America for what looked like insouciance in the face of a seemingly unstoppable disaster, a man with a flair for bad PR. In the early days of the leak he offered the consolation that the spillage was tiny compared to the size of the ocean. Later, as the oil came ashore, he apologised for the disruption to the livelihoods of fishing and tourist communities, and said that he too wanted his ""life back"". ""He wouldn't be working for me after any of those statements,"" President Obama said, and by the end of the year, he had left BP. What was to be his life thereafter? Hayward was 53 when he parted from the company he'd served for nearly 30 years, eventually on a salary of $6m. The pension and severance package must have been generous. He could have reflected bitterly on the unfairness of his role as the lightning conductor for blame – as he said, Deepwater Horizon was a complex accident involving several companies – and then ""moved on"". He might have run a charity for tarred seabirds or, as a geologist, spent days with a hammer on the Dorset coast. Directorships could have supplemented his income. It would have been a quieter life – more time on the yacht – but by no means a poor one. But Hayward did none of these things. Instead, he created an investment vehicle called Vallares with initial capital of £100m provided by Nat Rothschild, two other businessmen and himself. Stock market flotation raised £1.35bn, and this month Hayward, as Vallares's chief executive, announced that new shares worth a similar amount would be sold to finance a merger (technically, a reverse takeover) with a Turkish company, Genel Energy International, which holds rights to oil reserves in the Iraqi province of Kurdistan. Hayward will replace the Turkish entrepreneur Mehmet Sepil as Genel's CEO, clearing the way to a stock exchange listing that may have been problematic had Sepil, who was fined £1m last year for insider trading, remained in day-to-day charge rather than assuming his new role as president. The company aims to be included in the FTSE 100 next year. The potential is enormous. In Hayward's words, Kurdistan may be ""the last big on-shore 'easy' oil province available for exploration by private companies anywhere in the world"", with reserves equivalent to the North Sea's before those were exploited. Already, thanks to his initial stake, Hayward is several million pounds richer. I read this in the business pages last week. Elsewhere, the same paper recorded that a Manchester man had been jailed for 18 months for handling stolen goods (a 37in TV) in the riots. No one has accused Hayward of criminal behaviour, whatever the record of his new company's president, but the contrast in the consequences of two successive summer outrages is a striking one. The Deepwater Horizon crisis made Hayward the focus of American loathing in 2010, just as this year's looters had Britain's public and politicians calling for punishment and revenge. But capitalism has encouraged Hayward to ""move on"" in a way it won't be doing anytime soon to anyone found with a stolen TV in the boot of their car. Public disgrace – the fact of it, whether justified or not – no longer presents an obstacle to powerful careers. A century ago, disgrace had a different effect. The chairman and managing director of White Star Line, J Bruce Ismay, felt the full force of American contempt when the Titanic went down in 1912, and he never recovered. Many of the charges against him echo those raised against Hayward: that he neglected safety in pursuit of competition and profit. Hadn't he persuaded his captain to work up maximum speed while the ship entered an ice field? Hadn't he refused to equip the ship with more lifeboats because they would over-crowd the promenade deck? Nothing was ever proven. Incontestably, however, he had escaped on a lifeboat when more than 1,000 of his company's passengers, including women and children, waited to be saved. He made a plausible case for his behaviour – he jumped into the boat at the last moment, he insisted, because no more women and children answered his call – but the shame never died. For HG Wells, capitalism's ""noble pretension"" had jumped downwards with Ismay: ""He was a rich man and a ruling man, but in the test he was not a proud man."" The powerful had been seen to be no better than the rest of us. Like Hayward, he ran a company that had become only superficially British. Inheriting White Star from his father, his first act as owner had been to sell it to the Wall Street behemoth J Pierpont Morgan, who included it in the portfolio of his interests known as International Mercantile Marine. Like Hayward, he faced hostile Washington committees of inquiry who grew angry with his blocking answers: ""I do not know"" and ""I could not say"" (Ismay); ""I am not a cement engineer"" (Hayward). Neither man could charm the media. To American reporters, Ismay came across as disdainful and arrogant (""J Brute Ismay""); and in any case, he had previously made an enemy of the press magnate William Randolph Hearst, whose papers now crucified him as a cowardly aristo from the old world. The details of Ismay's subsequent life are contained in a fine new biography by Frances Wilson. The next year, aged 50, he quit White Star and spent increasing amounts of time at his house in Connemara. A kind of normality continued. As Wilson writes, he understood the difference between surviving and being alive. He remained a director of railway and insurance companies, but travelled to meetings with the carriage blinds drawn. His unhappy marriage went on being unhappy. He never returned to New York in the 24 years he had left to live, and a household rule banned the Titanic from mention. Reports, probably invented, said that when Irish children passed his gate they chanted: ""Coward, coward, coward."" Pauline Matarasso, Ismay's granddaughter, has written of how much family conversation liked to stick firmly to facts: ""Without a moral dimension, without words like hubris, competition, guilt, greed, hedonism, the event [the Titanic] was drained of emotion like a stuck pig of blood. It was their way of surviving; they could cope with a corpse."" Her grandfather, she added, was ""a corpse himself"". One might argue that disgrace didn't sink him, any more that it sinks the powerful today. One might also wonder how much he regretted passing up the opportunity to sink, literally, like his 1,500 dead passengers and crew. But at best, Ismay persisted as an undersea creature, shy and seldom seen. He never got his life back. This is what shame and feelings of personal responsibility did, once upon a time.",The Titanic disaster meant a life of shame for its CEO.

"Perhaps I was wrong, after all. I thought Europe's governments would spend any amount of money and impose any amount of austerity to rescue any number of banks from their recklessness and folly. All banks were too big to fail. No debt was too big to bail. Europe was in the grip of a classic banker's ramp. Yet Greece's bluffing of the high priests of the eurozone may, after all, be called. The unthinkable may be unavoidable. The priests are suddenly talking of ""when, not if,"" Greece defaults. Greeks themselves seem to regard devaluation as a less painful discipline than state-imposed austerity, and are probably right. Their partial default and de facto departure from the euro would be a truly seismic moment, requiring the instant restructuring of debts and possibly currencies across the periphery of the eurozone, covering Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy. It would be drastic, but since it has been predicted ever since Maastricht in 1992, it can hardly be regarded as unimaginable. At this point ""pro-Europeans"" have to stop talking rubbish and start on realpolitik. Alaric is not at the gates of Rome. Washington has not crossed the Delaware. Napoleon has not returned from Elba. All that may happen is that Europe's democracies, disregarded, distorted and corrupted for a quarter century by the oligarchs of Brussels, will crawl out from the shadow of the very Acropolis where democracy was born. For all sceptics of grand federations, gilded alliances, and upmarket mafias hatched down the ages in Europe's cloud-capped spas, this could be an exhilarating moment. There is nothing wrong in a currency zone of compatible political entities. There is a dollar union between the American states, and there have been attempts at using currencies to cohere earlier empires, with crowns, roubles and pounds sterling. But a union must reflect an underlying economic reality, with political institutions that can relate voting to taxing and spending, and borrowing to repaying. Where, as in Europe, this has become far from the case, the disciplines of a complex modern economy become unenforcible. Those in charge merely demand ""ever closer union"", which means ever more power over subordinate democracy. A good history of the euro was supplied by the Nobel economist, Paul Krugman, in the New York Times in January. He contrasted the US dollar area, with its federal government, common language and political culture, with the eurozone, which has none of these things. Krugman concluded that ""this, from the beginning, made the prospects of the single currency dubious"". Worse, it had floated up to ""grip the imagination of European elites"". The single currency became a passport to a bureaucratic utopia, a means to ever more glorious union. Practicalities were for nerds. I regard myself as a ""good"" European, but as far as the EU was concerned, that idealism was dented as each advance of Brussels power took ever greater liberties with Europe's taxpayers and legislators: regulating, subsidising and corrupting all it touched. A recent report showed the EU casually overpaying almost a billion euros to Greek farmers. It continues to throw more dead fish back in the sea than it takes out. It defaces Europe's countryside by subsidising half-built houses. It is still building itself a stupendous £280m palace in Brussels. The place is obscene. Because being ""pro-Europe"" is a faith cult rather than a policy, its adherents dare not raise a peep of protest at its outrages. Not for the first time in Europe's history, a centralised superstate stalks the continent with a retinue of uncritical appeasers unable to see the wood for the tax-free salaries. Sceptics are treated like Rhett Butler in Gone with the Wind – traitors to the great confederacy who should be shot for speaking home truths. That Germany should be the one country that can sensibly stage the euro bailout is doubly ironic. It is the one country that did not indulge in the housing bubble, most of its workers living happily in rented accommodation. Meanwhile, its constitution was crafted by the postwar allies to make its leadership of Europe near impossible. The German government is meant to be weak, at the mercy of its provinces and their electorates. If, as seems likely, Angela Merkel's voters grow fed up with bailing out Greece, or with bailing out banks, that will be an end to it. The euro lobby is now pleading, begging, goading Germany to brandish its old muscles and flash its old sword. It calls on Germans to tell Greece to knuckle under, slash spending and sack its workers. If this fails then Greece's benighted politicians should be stripped of power and made subject to fiscal union, with public spending controlled and political oversight to enforce it. Greece and the other weakened states of Europe should be put in hock to the gods of the euro. The postwar settlement was meant to liberate the smaller countries of Europe from this sort of overbearing treatment. It was meant to free their diverse histories, cultures and identities from centuries of great power victimisation. The symbol of such independence is the right to fix one's taxes, determine one's social security and value one's currency. There was no need for the euro. Even in the boom years, the best estimate is it may have boosted trade by 10-15%, but its bailout will more than wipe that out. The euro rescue packages now being mooted are eerily reminiscent of the reparations imposed so disastrously on Germany after the first world war. It may all be ""just"", but the forced impoverishment of Greeks, Portuguese and Italians to honour the paper value of German and French debts must be as close to revolutionary incitement as modern policy can get. Does nobody in Brussels read history? The former Tory chancellor, Lord Lawson, called the euro ""among the most irresponsible political initiatives of the postwar era"". Gordon Brown's most creditable epitaph is that he stopped the economically illiterate Tony Blair from joining it. Britain is free of its constraints, though not of its backwash. This is a true reformation moment in Europe's history, when a centralised and authoritarian Holy Roman Empire, grown fat and arrogant on the tithes of subject peoples, suddenly overreaches its power and faces a crisis of legitimacy. David Cameron here has a historic opportunity to draft a new European dispensation. This would involve a managed devaluation of the debts of the peripheral states, backed by rescue packages for individual banks that then find themselves in trouble. Their depositor arms should be bailed out, but not their casino operations. Alongside would be a managed restructuring of a eurozone of convergent northern economies, in which it is conceivable the UK might even take part. That may lead on to Cameron's ambition for a genuinely reformed Lisbon treaty, one that, unlike its predecessor, could pass the test of a referendum. Europe is clearly at a turning point, turning against the single-statism of the European movement, with its straitjacketed currency, its flows of economic migrants and counterflows of subsidies, its everlasting crises and its humiliation of democratic governments. It is turning back to national identity, and there is nothing the EU can do to stop it.",Europe is turning back to national identity – and it's exhilarating | Simon Jenkins,2011-09-15T20:30:02Z,Simon Jenkins,world
"In many ways this decade is the new 80s – you wake up thinking about politics, feel angry all day and go to sleep dreaming about Ken Clarke (not in a good way). But what was depressing about being on the left, then, was how marginal the position felt: that however much the mainstream distrusted the government, and was saddened by the country as it was, the core beliefs of the Labour party were just too far gone for normal society. It felt shrill to object to privatisation. What strikes me this time around is that objecting to privatisation is not enormously leftwing. By and large, mainstream opinion is opposed to privatising the NHS. It was opposed to selling off the forests. While much rightwing rhetoric centres on a bloated public sector, distrust of the private sector is more palpable. The idea that what the corporate sector skims off in profits, it saves in efficiency, is a cross-party Westminster axiom, but many people outside Westminster don't appear to believe it. So let's just take as an example the classic New Labour manoeuvre whereby local councils started to commission services, rather than give grants to organisations that performed statutory work; it didn't look like privatisation, as such. The business being fought over, between large corporations and small charities, did not look particularly attractive. When you look at a group in need, be they ex-convicts, the long-term unemployed or the disabled, your first thought is not ""ker-ching"". But what began as an uneventful process of ""efficiency"" savings has ended with a few looming providers – you could count them on the fingers of one hand – dominating the budgets of local authorities. The classic leftwing line would dictate that it would be de facto better for these services to be provided in-house. A centrist observer would say this is fine, if they are more efficient. But are they? One Society has produced some data on pay differentials, called A Third of a Percent (this is the pay of a UK low-paid worker compared to their chief executives). They found that private firms whose main income came from the public sector paid CEOs far more than the highest paid public sector employee. So, for instance, ""Serco, which receives over 90% of its business from the public sector, paid Christopher Hyman an estimated £3,149,950 in 2010. This is six times more than the highest paid UK public servant and 11 times more than the highest-paid UK local authority CEO."" It's hard to compare Hyman to the lowest paid Serco employee, since the bottom figure visible on the collective bargaining records is for a Docklands Light Railway passenger service agent, at £35,000. But that almost certainly doesn't represent the bottom of the pay spine – for the period from 1 April 2009 electricians in Serco's Integrated Services bargaining unit were subject to a pay deal with a minimum rate equivalent to £10,358 a year. One Society is keen to point out that these aren't like-for-like figures, since the CEO's includes bonuses and pension. But I think it's safe to assume that the person on £10k does not have a huge pension pot or a bonus. So the CEO is paid around 276 times the national minimum wage. Will Hutton's fair pay review in March advised that no public sector boss should earn more than 20 times the salary of its lowest paid employee. ""In contrast,"" states this report, ""none of the 'public service industry' organisations we examined paid their CEO less than 59 times UK median earnings (estimate)."" Much focus on CEO remuneration has been on the fact that their climbing salaries are not matched by any improvement in productivity, and this might be down to the fact that excessive pay dispersion has been shown to interfere with company performance. But that isn't the point, and nor is it the point that when the lowest paid workers subsidise the highest, the taxpayer in turn has to subsidise them with tax credits, as low-paid workers can't keep their households together. Our own senses should be enough: it is impossible for one human being to be 276 times more competent, better trained, more experienced, harder working, than another. If that's the differential, someone's on the make. Not wishing to pick on Serco, since the situations in A4e, Capita and G4S are similar, these companies do, when they have a profit glitch, behave like any other big four with a stranglehold on the money supply: they squeeze suppliers. Last year, worried about local authority cuts (which of course hadn't happened at this point), Serco sent out a letter to suppliers demanding a 2.5% reduction in costs, on the basis that, ""Like the government, we are looking to determine who our real partners are that we can rely upon. Your response will no doubt indicate your commitment to our partnership"". They rescinded this after widespread outrage, but the message will have been easily recognised by anyone who's ever objected to the working strategy of a major supermarket: we're your conduit to the public cash cow, and you'll do as we say. This is nobody's idea of a good system: that all our tax, which we pledge to alleviate the hardship of the most disadvantaged, should go into the top pockets of a handful of companies, who will then underpay their employees (for ""efficiency"") and squeeze their suppliers. You don't have to be leftwing to object to this. (But it helps.)",Is it lefty to ask why our tax pays private CEOs millions? | Zoe Williams,2011-09-15T08:00:00Z,Zoe Williams,society

"The great delusion of the age is that society must be endlessly grateful to the wealthy. They owe nothing to society. Rather, society owes everything to them as ""wealth generators"" because society contributes nothing to their success. The mores and values that inform the rest of human interaction – reciprocity, proportional distribution of pain and reward, trust and social obligation – must be suspended for them. If we want to enjoy the benefits of a dynamic capitalism we must recognise that the rich are different – and not self-defeatingly tax them. American neo-conservatives and their Republican outriders have worked tirelessly for 50 years to promote this hocus pocus, which offends not only the first principles of humanity, but of what we know about capitalism. Successful capitalism is an incredibly difficult phenomenon to create and sustain. It depends on entrepreneurial flair, yes, but also on ideas, institutions and processes ranging from great universities to innovative financial organisations that do not always appear spontaneously by the operation of free markets. They sometimes have to be designed by public action. Great businesses and wealth flower in strong societies that equip their entrepreneurs to prosper. The framework which supports this costs money, and it is proper that the rich should contribute proportionally. But this means ""Big Government"", complain American neo-conservatives, so that these unexceptional, commonsensical propositions become transmuted into an alleged dimunition of individual freedom – culminating in the Tea Party movement and the breakdown of US politics. Blessed is a weak society and strangulated state but with lots of lowly taxed, rich individuals. Except that in a generation's time everyone will be poorer. Last week Britain had its own mini tea-party moment – an extraordinary letter signed by some 20 economists who claimed to take the politics out of the debate about the top rate of income tax. Britain needed a growth strategy, they argued, and what was holding back inward direct investment, risk-taking and entrepreneurial zeal generally was Labour's increase in the top rate of income tax to 50 pence in the pound for those earning over £ 150,000, an increase that the coalition government had not reversed – but it should, they argued. It was over-exaggerated, politicised hype. Of course punitive, confiscatory tax rates are real deterrents to enterprise, but a 50% top tax rate hardly qualifies. Instead the writers embrace a notion of economic rationality that thinks it can identify predictable and measurable increases in effort and entrepreneurial zeal for comparable cuts in income tax in a linear relationship. But human motivation, especially for business builders and entrepreneurs, is infinitely more subtle. They are driven by a matrix of motivations. And, like everybody else, they are embedded in family and friendships that are rooted in place. The few good studies we have show, for example, that significant differences in top income tax do not cause people to migrate across US states – an easier task than coming in or out of Britain. Nor are the differences matched by significant differential growth performance. Equally, the assertion that top tax payers contribute so much revenue that they must be prevented from becoming a dying species is to mix up apples and pears. What has been driving the increases in revenue from the top 1% of tax payers is the monumental rise in income inequality over the last 25 years – a rise that has not been associated with improved economic performance. Rather, there has been an arms race driving ever higher executive pay, certainly bringing some upward bias to tax revenues, but it should hardly be confused as the "" incentive"" of lower tax on the rich. But the letter signatories were careless of this evidence – and much other evidence besides. For example, their assertion that other major economies ""had got back to pre-recession output levels"" while Britain, soaking the rich, had not, was plain wrong. All the six top high-income countries – the US, Germany, Japan, France, Italy and the UK – reported output in the second quarter of 2011 below the respective peaks of 2008. None has fully recovered. The US and Germany have fared least badly – but their rates of top income tax vary considerably. A linear correlation between taxing the rich and growth does not exist. The letter, for all its pretensions to be about ""non-political"" economics, was instead a surrender to the Tea Party world view. Pfizer did not recently close its operation in Sandwich, Kent, because of the 50% income tax rate: rather, massively concerned about its business model, it has concentrated research in those parts of the world where it judges that there is a strong ecology supporting the pharmaceutical industry. Equally Telefónica, locating its digital business in London last week, came because it liked Britain's openness and the ecosystem supporting its digital operation. The top rate of tax did not challenge this judgment. So why have 20 economists thus risked their standing? Part of the answer is that economics itself has been so captured by the neo-conservative right that many of its practitioners can no longer think straight. And for any variety of personal and political reasons, there is virility in associating oneself with a primitive, hunter-gatherer view of capitalism. To do better, to challenge the current orthodoxies, requires originality and hard work. Much easier to play to the gallery with a substandard letter to the FT. That is not to argue that the rich like paying tax. They don't. But a growing number, such as former M&S boss Sir Stuart Rose, urging the government not to heed the economists' call, recognise that the rich are part of society too. For perhaps the worst consequence of the letter is that it diverts discussion from what really drives dynamic capitalism – the revolutionary urge to innovate and the deep plumbing of its institutions which aid or abet that effort. Where this is not happening, it needs to be corrected by an enterprising state – an argument I and two colleagues set out in a paper ""Making the UK a global innovation hub"" for the newly formed Big Innovation Centre on www.biginnovationcentre. The top rate of tax can't alone be at the heart of a growth strategy. Britain needs more demand, stronger banks, better capitalism and sounder institutional structures to help us capitalise upon the coming wave of scientific and technological possibility. Get all that right, and growth and investment will follow. Wealth generation is about very much more than pampering the rich.",Growth is about so much more than just the top rate of tax | Will Hutton,2011-09-10T23:36:03Z,Will Hutton,politics
"Is there a louder silence in politics than that of Gordon Brown, prime minister of Great Britain between 2007 and 2010? At times he is so silent that you can hear almost nothing but the absence of a word from a man who is suffering seemingly eternal death by memoir. For Gordon is consigned to a political underworld, where his peculiar torment is to see himself monstered in a high-profile book, against which he must somehow set that recalcitrant jaw – only for another memoir to come down the slipway a few months later. Before the election, it was Andrew Rawnsley's meticulously researched account of the demise of New Labour, which laid bare the rages and the plottings and the conduct wildly unbecoming. Next came Peter Mandelson's book, in which his lordship passed on Tony Blair's view that Gordon was ""mad, bad, dangerous and beyond hope of redemption"", ""like a mafiosi"", and ""flawed, lacking perspective and having a paranoia about him"". Shortly thereafter we had the tome of Tone himself, whose knifing affected to come more in sorrow than in anger. Next week it is the turn of Alistair Darling, one of Brown's closest friends and allies over 20 years, though if the leaked extracts of his former chancellor's book are anything to go by, no longer on the kitchen supper list. What goes around comes around, some will say, and one can hardly argue with that. But in Gordon's case it comes around, and around, and around. So often have a certain set of euphemistic adjectives been applied to Brown that a strange semantic shift has taken place in my mind, and whenever I see them used in wholly unrelated circumstances, I almost have to remind myself of their pre-Brown meaning. ""Brooding"", ""glowering"", ""Shakespearean"" – I mustn't assume on hearing these words in other contexts that what the person is trying to say is ""barking mad"". ""Brutal and volcanic"" is the pairing Alistair Darling has gone for, according to reports, and doubtless we shall hear more detail in the coming days. Given the former chancellor has spoken previously of ""the forces of hell"" being unleashed upon him by Brown's winged monkeys (I paraphrase slightly), words may not be minced. Is Brown resigned to it? Is he honestly breaking the habit of a lifetime, and rising above it? Will he ever respond? This could go on for years, as a succession of Labour characters leave politics, or are left by politics, and realise that a sure way to a publisher's advance is to frontload their memoirs with recollections of the last big beast to menace their party's frontbenches. And very beastly they will doubtless recall Gordon to have been, with the possible exception of his devoted creature Ed Balls, whose claim this week that he didn't even want Darling's job in 2009 is perhaps the shadow chancellor's most screamingly funny fib so far. As for how much more he can take … well, I've never seen a beating like it. Or rather, a series of beatings. That Gordon is now taking these assaults offstage is somehow even more powerful than when he was stumbling around in public view like a baited bear. For let's not forget that people first began asking if he'd ever be put out of his misery when he was prime minister, stumbling from self-implosion to self-implosion. From the minute Brown decided against the snap election and his political capital evaporated almost overnight, it became commonplace to hear people speak of a mercy killing. Even his opponents confessed to finding it difficult to watch at times, just as Alex Ferguson admitted after his side beat Arsenal 8-2 last weekend that: ""You don't want to score more."" But on it has gone, with losing the election drawing no line. I've rather lost count of the score, but suspect Darling's book will nudge The Rest of World v Brown into 137-nil territory. Whether Gordon can technically go to ground again when he has been to ground for over a year is a conundrum, but what a knot of contradictions this quarry is. The author of a book on courage who bottled the election-that-wasn't, the pious minister's son who amassed the most lethal army of attack henchmen in contemporary politics, the self-styled grassroots politician who appears entirely uninterested in even turning up to parliament to represent the people who elected him. And now, he is the career control freak who has apparently become so laissez faire that he takes no material issue with any of the damning accounts, content to allow history to be his judge (good luck with that one, and all that). Perhaps Gordon really will go to his grave without telling his side of the story; perhaps he will break his silence in 20 years for a documentary only anoraks like me will watch. Perhaps he will record a blues album about it all. Whatever the truth, this latest blow reminds us that even in political death – or rather eternal torment – Gordon remains a fascinating psychological study. And, more worryingly for Labour, that even his deafening silence is more intriguing than anything Ed Miliband has ever said.","Gordon Brown, the baited bear who won't bite back | Marina Hyde",2011-09-02T20:15:01Z,Marina Hyde,politics
"Which ""bits"" of English history do we need to know? Should they be Simon Schama's peasants' revolt, Indian empire and opium wars, or David Starkey's rules of chivalry? Or is the Cambridge professor Richard Evans right to dismiss ""rote learning of the national patriotic narrative"" out of hand, in favour of studying ""other cultures separated from us by time and space""? The answer is none of them as such. All seem static moments torn out of the context of history to suit a particular outlook on the world. Evans is the most wrong of all. His disparaging use of words such as rote and patriotic implies that facts about one's own country are in some way irrelevant, even shameful. All history must start from the reader's own standpoint in place and time. Otherwise it is just a blur. The reason for learning history is not to hear stories but to follow themes that might help us understand the world about us. Without history, politics is fumbling in the dark. When Margaret Thatcher imposed a poll tax on the Scots in 1989, she seemed blind to the history of such taxes – disastrously so. When the British tried to rule southern Iraq in 2003 and to drive the Taliban from Afghanistan in 2006, they also ignored history. The story of the nation in which we live is not a stage set crowded with isolated tableaux: the Norman conquest followed by Henry VIII, Charles I, the Industrial Revolution and finally leaping to Hitler. Sturdy tales of slavery, gender oppression and the defeat of Germany yield anecdotes that may raise the reader's blood pressure. But they are history neutered of argument, uncreative, essentially dumb. They may make us angry, but not wise. History must be continuous, building from cause to effect and reaching a crescendo in the present day. England's narrative flow should be exhilarating and empowering. No country has such an eventful past, from the time when Germanic Angles and Saxons first pushed westwards across ancient Britain after the Romans withdrew in the fifth century. The English were, on any showing, a remarkable people, asserting their power and spreading their culture first across the British Isles and then round the world. They showed a confidence, sometimes an arrogance, which in the 19th and early-20th centuries led them briefly to bestride the globe, with an imperial countenance they still cannot shed. To me, two threads run through this narrative. The first is England's relations with its neighbours. This is so often sublimated into ""British history"", or that of ""the English-speaking peoples"" or worse ""our island story"", as if the English owned and occupied the other half of the British Isles still populated by Celtic descendants. In truth, the western and northern boundaries of England reached the line of Offa's Dyke, Hadrian's wall and the Irish Sea in the dark ages, and have hardly moved since.Saxons, Normans and Tudors could conquer the British Isles, but they could not suppress its people or their desire for greater self-government. I have no doubt that England's first empire – over the Celts – will fade in the 21st century. In 1920 Ireland had enough and most of it broke away, as eventually will Ulster. In 2000, Scotland and Wales began the same process. The reality is that these places have distinct histories of their own, as anyone knows who lives in them. As throughout Europe, provincial identities are acquiring political force. This is not good or bad, but inevitable. The same distinctiveness will apply to England. I have therefore sought to disinter England from the political homogeneity of Britishness. The other thread is that of the distribution of power within England, between central authority and local consent. Almost all the great events of English history concern this struggle: Becket's murder, Magna Carta, Henry VIII's tyranny, the fight against the divinity of kings and the campaign for universal franchise. In each case, central power was pitted against church, baronage, parliament or people. A version of that struggle continues today in the argument over the future of the welfare state. Running through this story is the primacy of money. From the Domesday Book to the present day, the obsession of England's rulers was with war, first against the French and the Scots, then for an empire and then as guarantor of European and world peace. War requires money, and this was granted by taxpayers only in return for redress of grievances. Even Edward I, ""hammer"" of the Celts, wondered when taxes ""paid to us out of liberality and goodwill … may in future become a servile obligation."" There had to be compromise or kings could not fight. The belligerence of England's rulers was ironically the engine of early rule by consent. In this story there was one overriding hero: parliament. Emerging from the early Saxon witans, parliament had by the 14th century already taken on the bicameral character it has today. It never lost its centrality in the constitution. It steered England through the agony of civil war. Under the Hanoverians, parliament and its ""parties"" took over the reins of government and was the cockpit for reform in 1832. Parliament, however ""rotten"" at times, never lost control of the argument. It was a creation of political genius. These themes, like history itself, cannot be told spasmodically. Today's debates over the electoral system and the reform of parliament are vacuous if not informed by previous ones. Britain's ambivalent relations with Europe and its confused global policy remain opaque if they ignore the experience of Pitt, Palmerston, Salisbury and Churchill. The devolution process is absurd if typified by David Cameron's ""I will fight for the union with every fibre in my body."" And how can we grapple with the size and role of government without watching the state wax ever bigger over the centuries, to become a colossus in the 20th century? I cannot see how any narrative can avoid starting at the beginning and running to the end, however hard it may seem to tell it that way. Reformers who have led history's decline into ""optionalism"" in the school curriculum want it taught by dipping in and out, claiming that to follow events through dates is boring and hard. Yet ends come after beginnings. Causes precede effects. Time's arrow flies through ""one damned thing after another."" I am an unashamed chronologist. Reformers also imply that England's political evolution is only a partial reflection of its history – and neglects social, gender and cultural themes. But history must start with the framework of authority. The distribution of power within a state is its essence, as wielded by kings, generals, politicians and electorates. Their story has to start with the much-derided reigns, battles, statutes and elections. History without dates wanders aimlessly in a fog. It is chemistry without elements or physics without maths. I have written a book that covers the main characters and events of England's history, short enough to be read at one sitting. It is ""argued history"", intended to inform and empower debate. The challenges faced by England today remain as they have always been: relations with its neighbouring peoples, and the internal tension between state power and personal freedom. To be in ignorance of how these challenges were met over 1,500 years not only misses a great story. For a democracy, it is dangerous.

"Fling off the cares of the world this autumn and climb up from the tidy mid-Welsh town of Llanidloes, north over the mountain road towards Machynlleth. Near a wild summit you enter a moonscape of old mineral workings and slag heaps. Here metals were mined in Roman times, and here the Victorians erected reputedly the largest wheel in Britain, the Martha pump, to serve what by the 1860s was the most productive lead mine in Wales's ""wild west"". At the time the settlement of Dylife boasted three places of worship, three inns, a school and a thousand inhabitants. Then, in the 1880s, prices fell and the ore lodes were exhausted. Between the wars the place emptied and the buildings collapsed or were demolished. Today only ghosts flit the high mountain air. A lonely inn remains, the Star, amid a community of sheep. Dylife laughs to scorn the idea of overcrowded Britain. It has returned to mother nature, its scarred hillsides dribbling streams from drowned pits and shafts. Over the surrounding moors, a more intrusive industry is marching past, the first of the 800 wind turbines sought by Wales's new leader, Carwyn Jones, to turn the Cambrian Mountains – still unprotected by national park status – into an industrial landscape the size of Glamorgan, festooned with turbines and lines of pylons down the Severn and Wye valleys. Jones should go down in history as the great desecrater of rural Wales – all just to win English subsidies to a handful of rich farmers. Dylife has had few obituaries. David Bick wrote about it in 1975 and I recently discovered a local account by Michael Brown, a Hereford tree surgeon adept at abseiling down mine shafts and disinterring old iron. His study appeared in 2005 and is a remarkable excavation, in every sense of the word. These amateur archaeologists are the unsung heroes of disappearing Britain, inquiring where scholars fear to tread, summoning to life a vanished past that escaped notice and thus official protection. Since the 17th century Wales's rural economy was richly supplemented with mineral extraction. By the Victorian age, not just coal and slate but iron, lead, copper, zinc and even gold were keeping Wales prosperous at a time when Ireland and Scotland were experiencing famine, clearance and depopulation. Obvious memorials are the miners' chapels still scattered across the uplands, long after the communities they served have gone. A more vigorous survival was Welsh middle-class life, and with it the Welsh language itself. The Dylife mine was sufficiently celebrated (and profitable) to attract the attention of such radicals as Richard Cobden and John Bright, who in 1858 put together a consortium to buy it outright for £24,000. Output peaked in the 1860s, but then declined in the face of foreign competition and a fall in the price of lead. Production limped on into the 1920s. There was reputedly a large barbed-wire dump on the site during the second world war, to string across mid-Wales to stop a German invasion inland from Cardigan Bay. Any Wehrmacht officer who chose this route to glory would have deserved more than an Iron Cross. When I first wandered these lonely acres as a boy, Dylife's church, big house, sheds and workings were still partly standing. They were certainly capable of restoration. Already Coalbrookdale in Shropshire was proving that industrial archaeology could be a popular draw, with the founding of the Ironbridge Gorge museum. I envisaged a similar future for Dylife. At the time I was campaigning for another ghost settlement, the slate quarry of Bryneglwys in the shadow of Cader Idris in Snowdonia. The site was served by the narrow-gauge Tal-y-llyn railway. The old quarry had been in use until 1946, its first-grade slates used to roof the Houses of Parliament. A smaller settlement than Dylife survived on terraces and levels along the hillside, with the quarry town of Abergynolwyn in the valley below. Apples grew in the orchard of the manager's house. Tally books lay abandoned on office shelves and the dressing sheds were stacked with uncut slates. There were overnight barracks and even a shed called the Savoy Cafe. To an adventurous boy, the place was magic. In 1977 the Forestry Commission arrived at Bryneglwys. The devastation then wrought by this dreadful body has yet to see a ""truth and reconciliation"" commission. It bulldozed Bryneglwys to the ground. It surrounded the site with barbed wire and pattern-bombed it with conifer saplings. They marched down the old high street, respecting no contour. The commission refused requests to spare even a fragment of the old place in an orgy of obliteration. Streams were acidified and became spate torrents. Fish vanished. A diverse mountain ecology was destroyed. Conifers rose even through the manager's parlour, Wales denied even its Angkor Wat. Attempts are now being made to make amends. There are signs pointing to the site of Bryneglwys for tourists pouring up the Tal-y-llyn railway line, now scene of the August race-the-train marathon. There are occasional guided tours. But there is no way these ghosts can come back to life. We attack multinationals for doing such things abroad. We ignore the beams in our own eye. The failure to guard the relics of Britain's status as cradle of the industrial revolution was a cultural scandal of the past generation. The value now attached to Coalbrookdale, Saltaire and Liverpool docks makes the loss of other sites the more piteous. The great iron foundries of Dowlais are no more. Tower Hamlets council demolished London docks in Wapping, to clear the site for Rupert Murdoch's printing works. A desperate effort is needed to save some of the great Lancashire and Yorkshire cloth mills for posterity. These were not just fine buildings but emblems of Britain's technological and trading sophistication, as the British Museum and the Royal Albert Hall are of its cultural prowess. One of Dylife's pits is guarded as an ancient monument. With Brown's book in hand and a good map, it is possible to walk the terrain and enjoy the mountain air, though the site is at present near meaningless to any but the most expert and intrepid. I am sure the old workings could be restored and reinterpreted, and the layout of the former settlement indicated to visitors. Unlike Bryneglwys, Dylife is not beyond recall. The Victorians restored Britain's medieval churches and castles, to honour the nation's former religious and military greatness. They showed a confidence both in the past and in the contribution an awareness of it might make in the future. The Americans have done likewise with the derelict gold and silver mines of ""wild west"" Colorado, much to the delight of the tourist industry. There is no reason for Britain to neglect similar relics of its past. If England's taxpayers are to desecrate mid-Wales's horizons with turbines, for a paltry gain in energy, at least some of the money should be diverted to respecting its industrial landscape. Otherwise we shall be reduced to imposing preservation orders on ghosts.",If Britain fails to protect its heritage we'll have nothing left but ghosts | Simon Jenkins,2011-09-01T19:29:56Z,Simon Jenkins,uk
"Did anyone feel for Richard Branson and his Necker Island inferno – sympathy, empathy, anything? If not, why not? The story had all the compelling ingredients. Lightning striking the £60m private island, fire raging through the Agatha Christie-sounding Great House. Guest Kate Winslet carrying Branson's 90-year-old mother to safety. Branson racing towards the burning house, stark naked. Perhaps too much information with that last one. I hope his hot-air balloons weren't damaged. Here was a story with everything. By ""everything"", I mean, billionaires and Oscar winners in peril! We'd have lapped this up in decades gone by. Fabulous, brave Kate, and her soot-smudged cheeks, carrying Granny Branson through the flames to safety – wow, it's like Titanic, only hotter. And yet no one I've come across seems that fussed about the Necker fire. Which seems surprising, even cold. Don't the rich burn like the rest of us? Moreover, this story was akin to a 1970s disaster movie. One almost expected the late Liz Taylor to waft on to ""set"" in mink and pearls, until becoming engulfed in flames and falling off a balcony, still clutching a martini glass. Indeed, maybe this (the feeling of fictional characters playing movie scenes) was part of the problem. Times are hard and getting harder. These people who are richer, bigger, ""better"" than us – it's as if we don't have the energy for them anymore. It seems to me that we're sick of them – ""them"" being the super-rich and/or mega-famous. After all this time, the penny has finally dropped that most of them wouldn't, well, piss on us if we were on fire. All that escapism was a con, a sedation of the masses. This is interesting on several levels. Where celebrity is concerned, I've long thought that the public had been played for suckers. We are constantly and loftily informed that we are obsessed with celebrities, when it stands to reason that those most obsessed with celebrity are celebrities themselves. After all, they're the ones who fought, schemed and scrabbled to become celebrities. However, in this instance, celebrity may be the ultimate pan-cultural, socioeconomic red herring. Recently, it's the rich who've been flushed out, exposed as ""different"", in various unflattering ways F Scott Fitzgerald, that big suck-up, probably wouldn't have considered. In Britain, the general attitude towards the rich and powerful seems to be shifting fast, from a default position of respect, to grudging respect, then simple resentment, right through to anger and disgust. This is for a variety of reasons: the cuts are really beginning to bite; weasel tax breaks are being offered to the top rung; and the seeming absence of homegrown Warren Buffett types insisting that their taxes be raised, because they've had it too easy. Buffett and others have been speaking out, frequently and eloquently, on such matters, but there's not been much from British millionaires/billionaires. Hang on, I'll just hang my head out of the window, cock my ears, see if I can hear anything from them. Nope, nothing. Of course, I don't know Branson's personal view. Arguably, he is Britain's most popular billionaire ever, someone who's managed to retain at least a semblance of blokeishness and accessibility. If even Dickie B can't get the British public interested in his near-fatal house fire, then there's no hope for the rest of them. Yet this is the same nation that was fascinated by the woman who leapt from the burning building during the riots. For days afterwards, we wanted to know who she was, and how she was (Monika Konczyk, and fine, if you're still interested). Where was the famous Brit compassion for those on Necker – what exactly do the super-rich have to do to engage our attention and sympathy these days? Oh I don't know. Perhaps start realising it's a two-way street? Don't go all nice on us, Alex. We love you angry Alex Ferguson has lifted his seven-year interview ban/feud-thingie with the BBC. Surely it didn't take Vesuvius this long to cool down after an eruption. I've stared into the mouth of Vesuvius and it's a lot less scary than the ""dormant"" Ferguson. Ferguson then gave an interview about the FA, which in the past has banned him from the touchline, and is now using eight Man United players for England. Declaring himself delighted, Ferguson said: ""Maybe [the FA] will realise how important we are to England, instead of treating us like shit."" Like I said, ""delighted"". Some might say that an anger management course beckons with Ferguson promising not to kick any more boots at the likes of David Beckham or trashing his rival, Arsenal manager, Arsène Wenger. But I'm not so sure. Ferguson appears to be respectfully muting his hecklings of the troubled Wenger at the moment. As for Bootgate – it's debatable whether Ferguson should have used something heavier. Anyway, wouldn't football be poorer without Ferguson's temple-throbbing, gob-flapping outbursts? In a game increasingly all about money, four-letter passion exudes a rare beauty. Celebrity sex tapes go beyond seedy Somehow, the celebrity sex tape has managed to hit a new low. Hustler magazine, purveyor of ""adult fun', claims to have possession of a sex tape featuring Rihanna and her support act, rapper J-Cole. Meanwhile, new X Factor judge, N-Dubz's Tulisa Contostavlos, denies that it is her on another tape. To whoever is behind these sex tapes – in more ways than one – you're not doing it properly. With the old-school celebrity sex tape (oh, those bygone innocent times!), those involved performed knowingly, either for fame (Paris Hilton, Kim Kardashian) or because they were blitzed and showing off (Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee). Afterwards, the celebrities would make coy faux-horrified remarks about it all being ""private"", even though you could probably have heard the Anderson-Lee session from space. In all these cases, a decision, however bizarre, had been made by the female to participate. Oh lord. Whereas in days gone by, a sexual exhibitionist would swing from a chandelier, the modern version has taken to pressing the trusty record button and showing the world her best reverse-cowgirl. By contrast, these new sex tapes seem to be either filmed covertly or are just fake. Thus, the time-honoured weapon – sex – is used against the prominent female. Don't tell me it isn't different for girls. Even if a sex tape is blatantly false, the notoriety attaches itself to the woman like a gossip-barnacle: she is instantly tarnished, by association, as someone who would make a sex tape, ""Wot a slag!"" etc. The radiant Rihanna and impressive Tulisa can probably cope – both have been through worse and survived – but still, how nasty. It all goes to show that in this twisting, turning modern world, the technology might keep changing, but the misogyny remains the same.","Sorry, Richard Branson – we didn't care about your blaze | Barbara Ellen",2011-08-27T23:07:47Z,Barbara Ellen,uk
"Did you see that gold mermaid sofa which belonged to Colonel Gaddafi's daughter? To adapt George Orwell's famous observations on the goosestep, a gold mermaid sofa is only possible in countries where the common people dare not laugh at the army. ""Its ugliness is part of its essence,"" Orwell went on of the preposterous high kick, in words which might just as easily be applied to that gilded monster of an arse-rest. ""For what it is saying is 'Yes, I am ugly, and you daren't laugh at me.'"" Well, they dare now, even as Tripoli's death-toll mounts, and it's hard not to smile at every photo of a rebel posing with a goofy two-finger salute on the sea-beast, like some malarial parody of a DFS advert. See also pictures of rebels posing in canoes in Gaddafi's swimming pool; laughing at his fairground; or tinkling on his white baby-grand pianos with sarcastically raised eyebrows. It's such a fine line between stupid and clever, as Spinal Tap's Nigel Tufnel once had cause to remark, and it's a similarly gossamer boundary between murderous and feared tyrant, and that plonker who bought some of the most tasteless nafferies in the wider north-African area. Gaddafi may not be in rebel clutches (at least at time of writing), but he is now, unquestionably, a joke. And it's hard not to be swept along in the exhilaration of the great dictator becoming a joke. Ridicule is powerful, which is why the likes of Gaddafi threaten everything to suppress it, and in the free exchange of irreverence is the seed of Libyan democracy. This week, one of the country's most prominent comedians spoke of the challenges of a newly empowered audience. ""Now it's very difficult to make them laugh about politics because they're joking themselves,"" explained Milood Amroni. ""Now the people are making the jokes and we're laughing."" It's infectious. Spotting a cockroach in the sunken bath at the ransacked compound of Gaddafi's brutal intelligence chief Abdullah Senussi, a rebel saluted it. ""Hello, Mr Abdullah,"" he is reported to have deadpanned. ""We thought we'd find you here."" For some, Gaddafi is even beyond a joke. ""If I make jokes about Gaddafi they wouldn't be good jokes,"" Amroni continued, ""because he's too weak now and it's not good to make jokes about a weak guy."" Ouch. And yes, I'm afraid I found the discovery of Gaddafi's Condoleezza Rice scrapbook almost too pathetic, and have filed it alongside the revelation from a former Bin Laden concubine that the late al-Qaida CEO had a massive crush on Whitney Houston, and was forever banging on about how ""truly Islamic"" she would be if only she hadn't been brainwashed by her then husband Bobby Brown. Bin Laden understood the terrible threat of people laughing at him, which he deemed a fate worse than death. Death he was ready for, he would often say, but in 2006 he admitted in a taped address: ""I fear to be humiliated."" As well he might. It is incredibly difficult to fight ridicule. The only way is to be a self-deprecatingly good sport, or to be funnier back, both of which are rather tricky if your entire shtick is built on fear. And these days you can't keep a good joke down, which is presumably why Pakistan's president Asif Ali Zardari has made any quips about him sent via text, email or Twitter punishable by 14 years' imprisonment. In his wise little book Fighting the War of Ideas Like a Real War, J Michael Waller insists dictators' desperate fear of being giggled at is justified. ""The more autocratic or extreme the leader,"" he adds, ""the more vulnerable he is to ridicule."" He reminds readers that Augustus Caesar outlawed rib-ticklers about himself, while jokes about the Nazi regime carried a death sentence and Soviet comedians had to appear before cultural censors nicknamed the Department of Jokes. On seizing power, Fidel Castro ordered official buildings to display signs reading ""Counter-revolutionary jokes forbidden here"", while in the 1980s Iran assassinated even exiled humorists, bumping off a comedian in Germany and a seller of satirical CDs in London. It's easy to think of other examples. Brazil's hangover from its dictatorial era is manifested in a law which bans ridiculing candidates in the three months prior to an election. Then there's everybody's favourite cuddly authoritarian socialist Hugo Chávez, who seeks to imprison satirists, and who last year banned any unauthorised use of even his name or image. In North Korea, only Kim Jong-il is permitted to make jokes, though he is, according to officials, ""a priceless master of witty remarks"". Sample gag? ""Those who love the future have nothing impossible to do."" Mm. I don't want to stick my neck out on this one, but I can't help feeling that somewhere in North Korea, someone is telling a rather better joke than that, and the lesson of history is that eventually, some day, enough North Koreans will even dare to laugh at their goosestepping army. For now, though, the joke is on Colonel Gaddafi – his madness and mermaid sofas – and given that the Libyans will need a laugh in the difficult times to come, it seems churlish not to join in.",Gaddafi has crossed the line between murderous tyrant and plonker | Marina Hyde,2011-08-26T20:30:00Z,Marina Hyde,world
"A couple of weeks ago, we asked Comment is free users for their suggested examples of the way that the media often distorts local stories beyond recognition. Given that the riots had just started, the response was a little underwhelming: this is a subject to which we'll return, ideally before Christmas – so if you know of any story that fits the bill – we're talking about 'Asylum seekers eat swans' syndrome, essentially – please get in touch at anywherebutwestminster@gmail.com. In the meantime, we're going to focus the next instalment on football. With the start of the 2011-12 season and the imminent closure of the transfer window, it's time to look at the effect that methods of modern business are having on the beautiful game. Massive sums are being spent, particularly by the kind of new arrivals in the top-flight represented by Manchester City. Manchester United have just part-floated on the Singapore stock exchange. Meanwhile, many clubs are struggling – though supporters are beginning to fight back via new models of mutualisation and community ownership (see the Supporters Direct initiative for details). On Wednesday, we're going to the clash between Chester FC and FC United of Manchester, both representative of the new wave of football mutuals. We want to feed in as much opinion and information from Comment is free into our coverage as possible. So, some questions… What's it like supporting a small club, particularly in the shadow of a Premiership giant? What's the appeal of allegiance to a lower-league side? Has where you live lost a football club, or is it in the midst of a fight to save one? Do you support a big club, and have concerns about what big money is doing to the experience of being a fan? And to what extent do you think that the mutual/community ownership option is the way to go? We'll be back on the thread at regular intervals.

"The first day after London started burning, I spoke to Claire Fox, radical leftwinger and resident of Wood Green. On Sunday morning, apparently, people had been not just looting H&M, but trying things on first. By Monday night, Debenhams in Clapham Junction was empty, and in a cheeky touch, the streets were thronging with people carrying Debenhams bags. Four hours before, I had still thought this was just a north London thing. Fox said the riots seemed nihilistic, they didn't seem to be politically motivated, nor did they have any sense of community or social solidarity. This was inarguable. As one brave woman in Hackney put it: ""We're not all gathering together for a cause, we're running down Foot Locker."" I think it's just about possible that you could see your actions refashioned into a noble cause if you were stealing the staples: bread, milk. But it can't be done while you're nicking trainers, let alone laptops. In Clapham Junction, the only shop left untouched was Waterstone's, and the looters of Boots had, unaccountably, stolen a load of Imodium. So this kept Twitter alive all night with tweets about how uneducated these people must be and the condition of their digestive systems. While that palled after a bit, it remains the case that these are shopping riots, characterised by their consumer choices: that's the bit we've never seen before. A violent act by the authorities, triggering a howl of protest – that bit is as old as time. But crowds moving from shopping centre to shopping centre? Actively trying to avoid a confrontation with police, trying to get in and out of JD Sports before the ""feds"" arrive? That bit is new. By 5pm on Monday, as I was listening to the brave manager of the Lewisham McDonald's describing, incredulously, how he had just seen the windows stoved in, and he didn't think they'd be able to open the next day, I wasn't convinced by nihilism as a reading: how can you cease to believe in law and order, a moral universe, co-operation, the purpose of existence, and yet still believe in sportswear? How can you despise culture but still want the flatscreen TV from the bookies? Alex Hiller, a marketing and consumer expert at Nottingham Business School, points out that there is no conflict between anomie and consumption: ""If you look at Baudrillard and other people writing in sociology about consumption, it's a falsification of social life. Adverts promote a fantasy land. Consumerism relies upon people feeling disconnected from the world."" Leaving Baudrillard aside, just because there is no political agenda on the part of the rioters doesn't mean the answer isn't rooted in politics. Theresa May – indeed most politicians, not just Conservatives – are keen to stress that this is ""pure criminality"", untainted by higher purpose; the phrase is a gesture of reassurance rather than information, because we all know it's illegal to smash shop windows and steal things. ""We're not going to be diverted by sophistry,"" is the tacit message. ""As soon as things have calmed down, these criminals are going to prison, where criminals belong."" Those of us who don't have responsibility for public order can be more interrogative about what's going on: an authoritarian reading is that this is a generation with a false sense of entitlement, created by the victim culture fostered, and overall leniency displayed, by the criminal justice system. It's just a glorified mugging, in other words, conducted by people who ask not what they can do for themselves, but what other people should have done for them, and who may have mugged before, on a smaller scale, and found it to be without consequence. At the other end of the authoritarian-liberal spectrum, you have Camila Batmanghelidjh's idea, movingly expressed in the Independent, that this is a natural human response to the brutality of poverty: ""Walk on the estate stairwells with your baby in a buggy manoeuvring past the condoms, the needles, into the lift where the best outcome is that you will survive the urine stench and the worst is that you will be raped . . . It's not one occasional attack on dignity, it's a repeated humiliation, being continuously dispossessed in a society rich with possession. Young, intelligent citizens of the ghetto seek an explanation for why they are at the receiving end of bleak Britain, condemned to a darkness where their humanity is not even valued enough to be helped."" Between these poles is a more pragmatic reading: this is what happens when people don't have anything, when they have their noses constantly rubbed in stuff they can't afford, and they have no reason ever to believe that they will be able to afford it. Hiller takes up this idea: ""Consumer society relies on your ability to participate in it. So what we recognise as a consumer now was born out of shorter hours, higher wages and the availability of credit. If you're dealing with a lot of people who don't have the last two, that contract doesn't work. They seem to be targeting the stores selling goods they would normally consume. So perhaps they're rebelling against the system that denies its bounty to them because they can't afford it."" The type of goods being looted seems peculiarly relevant: if they were going for bare necessities, I think one might incline towards sympathy. I could be wrong, but I don't get the impression that we're looking at people who are hungry. If they were going for more outlandish luxury, hitting Tiffany's and Gucci, they might seem more political, and thereby more respectable. Their achilles heel was in going for things they demonstrably want. Forensic psychologist Kay Nooney deals impatiently with the idea of cuts, specifically tuition fees, as an engine of lawlessness. ""These people aren't interested in tuition fees. In constituency, it's most similar to a prison riot: what will happen is that, usually in the segregation unit, nobody will ever know exactly, but a rumour will emanate that someone has been hurt in some way. There will be some form of moral outrage that takes its expression in self-interested revenge. There is no higher purpose, you just have a high volume of people with a history of impulsive behaviour, having a giant adventure."" Of course, the difference is that, in a prison, liberty has already been lost. So something pretty serious must have happened in order for young people on the streets to be behaving as though they have already been incarcerated. As another criminologist, Professor John Pitts, has said: ""Many of the people involved are likely to have been from low-income, high-unemployment estates, and many, if not most, do not have much of a legitimate future. There is a social question to be asked about young people with nothing to lose."" There seems to be another aspect to the impunity – that the people rioting aren't taking seriously the idea it could rebound on them. All the most dramatic shots are of young men in balaclavas or with scarves tied round their faces, because it is such a striking, threatening image. But actually, watching snatches of phone footage and even professional news footage, it was much more alarming how many people made no attempt at all to cover their faces. This could go back to the idea that, with the closure of a number of juvenile facilities and the rhetoric about bringing down prison populations, people just don't believe they'll go to prison any more, at least not for something as petty as a pair of trainers. I feel for them; that may be true on a small scale, but when judges feel public confidence seriously to be at issue, they have it in themselves to be very harsh indeed (I'm thinking of Charlie Gilmour). But there is also a tang of surreality around it all, with the rioters calling the police ""feds"", as though they think they are in The Wire, and sending each other melodramatic texts saying: ""So if you see a brother . . . SALUTE! If you see a fed . . . SHOOT!"" Late on Monday night, news went round Twitter that Turkish shopkeepers on Stoke Newington Road in Dalston were fighting off the marauders with baseball bats, and someone tweeted: ""Bloody immigrants. Coming over here, defending our boroughs & communities."" And it struck me that it hadn't occurred to me to walk on to my high street and see what was going on, let alone defend anything. I was watching events on a live feed, switching between Sky and the BBC, thinking how interesting it was, even though it was audible from my front door and at one point, when I couldn't tell whether the helicopter noise was coming from the telly or from real life, it was because it was both. The Dalston clashes remind us, also, that it wasn't just JD Sports, even though the reputation of that chain is, for some reason, the most bound up with everything that's happened. Smaller, independent corner shops, the kind without a head office in Welwyn Garden City, that aren't insured up to the teeth, were ransacked as well, for their big-ticket items of booze and fags. When a chain is attacked, the protection of its corporate aspect means that, while we can appreciate the breakdown of law and order, we do not respond emotionally. When a corner shop is destroyed, however, the lawlessness has a victim, and we feel disgusted. That's what drags these events into focus: not the stuff that was stolen, but the people behind the stuff. • This article will be opened to comments from 9am (UK time) on Wednesday",The UK riots: the psychology of looting | Zoe Williams,2011-08-09T19:59:00Z,Zoe Williams,uk
"The phone-hacking scandal has blown open no end of themes – not least, the standards of the press and the future of media regulation. With all that in mind, as the next Anywhere but Westminster instalment looms, we want to get into the nitty-gritty of what media misbehaviour means for people well away from either celebrity culture, or those elevated places where politicians mix with newspaper executives. So, a question. Has some aspect of where you live been seriously misrepresented by the national press? Has a particular story been distorted beyond recognition, or told in terms of blatant falsehood? If so, we want to hear from you. You can either post below, or email us at anywherebutwestminster@gmail.com.

"It should be easy enough: you scan the petitions, pick a favourite, and within a few minutes, experience the delicious sensation of being as David Cameron put it when he trailed this opportunity in 2010, ""invited in"" to the political process. A big part of ""fixing broken politics"", he announced, would be making sure ""people feel they can play a part"" in a way that was impossible with plain old representative democracy. For instance, there would be these new petitions whereby, unlike old-style Labour ones, the power of 100,000 signatories would be enough – potentially – to trigger a Commons debate. ""Any petition with a million signatures,"" Cameron thrillingly pledged, ""will allow members of the public to table a bill that could end up being debated and voted on by MPs."" Does democracy get any better? All that stands between members of the public and this terrific offer of engagement is the petitions website itself which, within days of its launch, bears such a close resemblance to Labour's chaotic and depressing predecessor that it feels as if the original contributors had been cryogenically preserved ready to resume, as soon the call came, their traditional obsessions with petrol and hanging and stopping foreign aid. At any rate – at the time of writing – bankers are still mysteriously in the clear and opponents of tuition fees have been slow to engage, but there has been an immediate response from the usual suspects: motorists, Fathers 4 Justice and people with a thing about St George. Admittedly there is still no word from the 50,000 who recently wanted Jeremy Clarkson for prime minister, but perhaps his supporters are aware that the celebrity motorist is already the next best thing: the prime minister's loyal mate. As it is, with repeated demands for capital punishment for all serious offences (except for wearing leather loafers without socks), much of the new site reads, as anticipated, as a sociopath's blueprint for Utopia: the kind of place where you can drive as fast as you like, rarely see a foreigner, feed bread and water to prisoners on their breaks from forced labour, watch Formula One on a free BBC, kill anyone who breaks into your house and use ""natural bodybuilding to encourage health in the United Kingdom"" – all with absolutely no interference from EU human rights legislation, which will itself be strangled to death by a posse of elite petrolheads in high-waisted jeans. Prominent democrats, such as the Hansard Society's Dr Andy Williamson, have welcomed this ornament to public life: ""Petitions matter as a potential on-ramp to democratic re-engagement."" But within days of the on-ramp's arrival, the e-petitions are already so numerous and disorganised that it could almost have been designed to frustrate the emergence of a single demand with enough signatories to test Cameron's sincerity. Like the multiple calls for an English parliament, and for leaving the EU, support for capital punishment is distributed over numerous rival e-petitions, although the official list of disallowed proposals repeatedly gives duplication as the reason for rejection. Maybe this is the cue for execution enthusiasts to agree on a preferred method, between lethal injection and hanging, and really get behind it? Padding out requests from the punishment lobby are any number of worthy, but less eye-catching pleas, all just as doomed as the 33,068 e-petitions that were generated then ignored under Blair and Brown, along with the even greater number that were judged by discerning professionals to be too worthless for public assessment. Unless a moderately sane petition or two can be quietly marshalled to the fore – unlikely, to judge by the current contents – the new website already looks less likely to generate public re-engagement than, by raising unrealistic expectations of direct influence, to intensify the disappointment with representative democracy that dismayed Cameron in the first place. However, for believers in collective intelligence, there should be much on this website to cherish. Like his friend Rebekah Brooks, who prided herself as editor of the Sun on a petition of more than 1.5 million signatures demanding the sacking of ""ALL the social workers involved in the case of Baby P"", Cameron respects passionate public feeling. Supporting the Baby P demand, which identified seven workers by name, he congratulated the ""army of Sun readers who signed their names to that petition"": each name was, he said, ""a cry for justice"". Brooks, in her Cudlipp lecture, subsequently recalled how ""the public outcry was deafening"" and how this ""collective power"" meant ""Ed Balls was forced to use emergency legislation to ensure that those responsible were held to account"". In May an appeal court described Shoesmith's dismissal by Balls as ""intrinsically unfair and unlawful"". In June, one of the social workers targeted by the Sun's army, Sylvia Henry, received an unreserved apology and undisclosed compensation from that newspaper, which accepted that Ms Henry ""played no part and bears no responsibility for the circumstances surrounding the death of Peter Connelly and that she did her best for him"". Possibly the kind of collective mentality that is generated by Brooks and endorsed by David Cameron cannot, fairly, be compared to the ""wisdom of crowds"" theory, the subject of an influential, 2004 book by the journalist James Surowiecki. Summarised by his publishers, this thinking holds that ""large groups of people are smarter than an elite few"", and reportedly explains what would otherwise be unaccountable: the re-introduction of government-hosted petitions by Cameron's blue skies thinker, Steve Hilton. Supposing you never studied a contrary theory called ""the risky shift"", and can jettison all thoughts of tulip mania and the South Sea Bubble, not forgetting more recent memories of Princess Diana's obsequies, online bullying, Jedward and destructive Twitter mobs, Surowiecki's is an appealing proposal, nicely demonstrated by new pressure groups such as 38 Degrees, and indeed by Twitter, when the crowd is being witty, kind and constructive. Back to the e-petitions website, where attention has turned to speed limits for mobility scooters, and any reasonably intelligent crowd would have to conclude that to revive this outfit, in strengthened form, from the oblivion into which it had been so deservedly consigned, was something worse than idiotic. The term that Douglas Alexander allegedly applied to Ben Wegg-Prosser, credited with inventing this self-imposed form of web-torture, was ""prat"". For Cameron, the least worst outcome is that no petition generates enough signatories for a phoney debate. The next is a stagey affirmation of the capital punishment status quo, balancing his democratic credentials against the anger of already angry people who have wasted a whole minute demanding the return of hanging. But the road-pricing petition, with almost 2 million signatories, shows that anything might happen – including a variation on the 2009 ""Gordon Brown should resign"" e-petition, with 70,000 votes, or one that Cameron launched the same year, vainly invoking ""the power of our collective pressure"" to procure an immediate general election. Next time, his proven commitment to public hysteria might make it that bit more likely.",This is a platform for hysteria rather than people power | Catherine Bennett,2011-08-06T23:07:02Z,Catherine Bennett,politics
"New studies show sticking a tube up what I had better call your back passage, flushing gallons of water into it, then, er … letting it all out again does not have miraculous health benefits. This news may not be as significant as the collapse of the global economy, but neither is it a total surprise. Both depend on sets of completely irrational beliefs. I am no expert in the flushing out of debt from the rich to the poor, but I do unfortunately know something about the up-your-bum stuff. Colonic irrigation, now called colonic hydrotherapy (nicer and less agricultural?) was, like everything from IVF to Scientology, once only the province of wacky celebrities. Yet we are all, as Britney declared, Toxic. Modern life is rubbish. The idea that our bodies are festering with nastiness makes some sort of sense, though in my defence, I have always believed myself to be nothing without my toxins. The idea of a detox has an appeal. Cut down the booze. Eat simply. Give your system a break; let your mind roam free. As we enter Ramadan, one sees in the cyclic nature of fasting and feasting something elemental. As children starve in Somalia, though, there remains an awful decadence in connecting empty guts to spirituality. There is nothing spiritual about famine. We all live with this dreadful duality. We can witness the passive gaze of those who are too broken to ask for help and on the next page we can read advice from that paragon of health, Courtney Love. Love was a big fan of colonics until 2007. Then she stopped, following a  fraught car journey in which she had ""to use the lavatory after one treatment went 'horribly wrong'"". Lovely. Now people fly all the way to Thailand to stick tubes up themselves and squat over holes. Last year I found myself deep in the West Country being asked to do much the same. I had agreed to go to what I believed was a spa with a friend who was grieving. We both thought some sort of R&R would do her good. To be frank, I didn't think too much about it, imagining a week of eating salad in the countryside. When I arrived, I realised we were at a hippy bootcamp. The next shock was to find not only was there no food but we were expected to perform DIY colonic irrigation twice a day! All we had was watered-down juice and psyllium husks mixed with water, which as far as I could tell was indistinguishable from wallpaper paste. This was all combined with endless group therapy, some vaguely Buddhist meditation and lectures on nutrition from people who, despite no medical training, knew better than the entire medical establishment. Right from the start I thought the colonic business was deeply dangerous because it involved balancing on a board over a loo with a bucket of water. I wasn't so much worried about perforating my bowel (one of the more unpleasant side-effects of this practice), but falling off this narrow board, breaking my back and having the bucket fall on my head, thus leaving me unconscious and in the care of these new-age nutters. For ever. It is fair to say I lost my mind. My resistance, of course, was met with condescension. I was angry because the toxins were coming out. My feelings of hunger weren't actual feelings of hunger – I was getting in touch with my inner child. If this were true, I would have eaten it. My questioning was part of my over-intellectualised armour, rather than the result of my reading about the philosophy of what was going on while I was unable to sleep. Electrical devices were frowned upon, but of course I had smuggled in an iPad. Thank Christ. The group of people I was with were mostly lovely. They felt what they were doing was providing all sorts of benefits. It's true that if you don't eat anything and give yourself constant enemas, weight loss will occur (though not last). Yet as any doctor will tell you, we have organs to detox us – kidneys and livers – and if they don't work, we are in big trouble. Colonic irrigation depends on finding something else to remove. So we had lectures about ""mucoid plaque"" – undigested stuff that stays in your guts for decades, producing all kinds of bad symptoms. This confused philosophy is not new. For the Egyptians, then the Greeks and then extending into the medieval period, the idea of ""auto-intoxication"" was prevalent – decomposing food inside the intestines causing illness. But those who actually cut bodies open – surgeons or those conducting autopsies – find no evidence of the intestines full of strange black stuff that the colonic cult boasts of in its group sessions. I sat in wonder as middle-class women, one after another, explored and examined in detail, not to put too fine a point on it, their own shit. The ""evidence"" for this, as with much alternative medicine working, then, is anecdotal and exists only in the imagination – but that imagination is vivid enough for a thriving business. All the fine doctors and sceptics who rail against such nuttiness never take into account the psychological reasons that people seek out these forms of help. Why do we want to feel cleansed, for instance? Debunkers of alternative therapies rarely treat the symptoms – they just dismiss the silly practices. More and more I see closed arguments between new-agers immune to evidence (with their prana and vital energies and chi, which in the end, come mighty close to God) and fundamentalist rationalists who will not budge an inch. Surely good doctors always have worked ""holistically"". The fears of Big Pharma are now fuelled, weirdly, by the rightwing as well as the flat-Earthers. But who cannot worry about the drugging of the underclass with antidepressants and Ritalin? Science provides the best answer until a new one comes along, and until that bizarre week of fasting, I saw myself as a sceptic. Yet, strangely the sceptics' sneers are now as off-putting to me as jangling dreamcatchers. Many of the sceptic movement's proponents do it no favours. Science and evidence are their gods, but they lack the emotional intelligence to win anyone over. I objected to taxpayers funding the Pope's visit as much as the next atheist, but the spectacle of ""intellectual"" men sneering at devout Catholic women was horrible. Fundamentalist atheists and sceptics are not interested in changing minds, but simply shoring up each other's cleverness. The best advocates of science, such as Brian Cox, show us that transcendence already exists in the universe. The best humanists acknowledge that rituals around birth, death, cleansing and fasting are part of our narrative. I want a scepticism that queries rather than condemns. So I am perfectly happy to say colonic irrigation is crap, but not happy to insult everyone who veers away from the mainstream. Snake oil comes in vast containers these days, from the top down. Deep down, the problem is not in our bottoms, but in our minds.",What's worse than colonic irrigation?

"I'm going to assume a working knowledge of who Rastamouse is; if you can't rank the Zingzillas in descending order of pestilence, then you probably will not be interested in what's going on in London's Regent's Park this weekend. The Lollibop festival features the major characters from CBeebies, plus some from Channel 5's Milkshake. The pressing question is this: isn't the whole point of telly that you can watch it at home and you don't have to go anywhere? Well, everybody knows watching telly isn't educational. Everybody knows that it's a social problem, an obesity timebomb waiting to happen. Whereas watching, say, a giant mouse leaping about on a mini-stage, a bit like Glastonbury without the drugs that are really just aspirins: who's to say what an under-five might learn from that? It's very easy to sound curmudgeonly about modern child-rearing, even when you're in the middle of it. The first thing the photographer said was: ""In my day, we wouldn't have had all these buggies."" He appeared genuinely to believe that, 50 years ago, babies were born knowing how to walk. I, conversely, am not against the indulgence of wheeled transport. I'm not totally opposed in principle to doing something just because children might enjoy it, as opposed to what 1970s parents rather grandly term ""benign neglect"", which meant sitting in a pub garden and using your children as wasp bait to keep them away from your pint (the wasps. And the children). But this … this is ridiculous. The tickets are £25, which is a lot for an adult and an eye-popping amount for a child (everybody is too polite to mention it. Or, being fair, maybe they don't agree). There are giant characters off the telly, then other, indeterminate creatures wandering about, basically frightening all the children. Under-fives, by the way, are an incredibly hard sell, which is why I have left mine at home, even though they are the dead bullseye of this audience (they're two and three, and they watch a lot of telly). Almost everything causes them some distress in this age group, even if it's just the distress of being too happy. You might think they'll like something, and you might be right, but they only realise they liked it four days afterwards. If they lose or break something you've just bought them (which they will, because it will be a Peppa Pig helium balloon), their despair is total, and can't help but strike you as disproportionate, considering that, five minutes ago, they were living quite happily without it. I bowled up to loads of mothers, just to ask: ""Is this what you were expecting?"" An actual festival, complete with dodgy burgers (of course I'm lying. They were not dodgy. They were organic.) ""I don't know what I thought it was,"" said Mel, mother of Roisin, two. ""I suppose I hoped she'd get a feel for live music."" Danya, who had a 17-month-old called Zach, said: ""It's a real ex-festival crowd, isn't it?"" Zach seemed to be quite enjoying it, I will concede. ""How do you think they're going to turn out, this generation?"" I lobbed this wide-angled question at a grandmother, Cathy. ""It's a bit frightening, isn't it? I mean, they have to have an outlet. They're not allowed to play out any more. My daughter's got a 19-year-old son and she worries about him like he's two."" ""It's not going back that long, either,"" added her friend Shirley. ""Even our children played out. But now they're not allowed to do that. You have to think of a way to get them outdoors."" There's a guy in a tent blowing bubbles. Seriously. A faintly grumpy man blowing bubbles, while keeping up a half-hearted monologue, for toddlers to pop (the bubbles; not the monologue). I've got one of those at home! But this is by no means a one-off; this is an industry. Mel had been to Peppa Pig World on Tuesday, Lollibop on Friday and was going to In the Night Garden Live on Monday. Cally, with two-year-old Amber, was here for Baby Loves Disco (it's a franchise), but saves her fullest praise for a snow creature you can visit seasonally in the West End. ""I get pleasure out of her pleasure. So even if she doesn't remember it, which she won't, I'll have enjoyed it. I work, so I feel like I should make up for the days I'm not with her by packing in loads of stuff."" It's not that I don't buy it. ""Just watching our daughter's squeals of laughter made it a magical day!"" someone said on the Night Garden leaflet. How do you argue with that? It's great when they squeal. But I had a magical morning by filling my face with cherry tomatoes, then popping them out like a tennis ball machine. Laugh? My daughter literally wet her pants. It's quite a waste of tomatoes. But, people, it doesn't cost 100 quid.",Zoe Williams: Festival fun? It's all a bit wasted on children,2011-08-05T19:49:01Z,Zoe Williams,society
"Jane Horrocks doesn't do things by halves. Some people bite the hand that feeds them, she rips off the whole arm at the shoulder. Or so it seemed with her comment about Tesco being ""full of chavs"". Not forgetting the ""pensioners holding everyone up"" and ""screeching kids"". Wow, such contempt, even though their commercials bought Horrocks the home she dubbed ""Tesco Towers"" and, as she said herself, gave her the financial security not to have to do ""crap"" work. I wasn't surprised. I interviewed Horrocks years ago, presuming she'd be nice, but she was awful. With every question, she eyed me like a cobra weaving up out of a basket. I asked at one point whether she'd ever fancied doing my beloved Corrie, and she was really snotty about it. ""Why would I do Coronation Street?"" (Erm, because it's a British institution, because it's well written and acted, because the likes of Sir Ian McKellen don't seem to think it's beneath them.) Shortly after we'd spoken, I got word not to write up the interview, because of lack of space. What a relief. It was as if Horrocks had been given myriad blessings (talent, intelligence, quirky beauty, that engaging Lancashire accent), and instead chose to turn her back on her own working-class background, and become a dreary snob. Talk about going over to the luvvie dark side. On a wider level, how depressing that this is what ""doing well"" means to some people – the opportunity not to look back in anger, so much as to look around and sneer. There has always been mockery for people, who bang on about their working-class origins, their impeccable council house credentials – guilty! And I get it, I understand why this kind of thing (competitive retro-poverty?) can seem hilariously overdone, in that Monty Python ""We lived for three months in a brown paper bag in a septic tank"" kind of way. The question is, do you ""get"" us? Do you register that it's not all about chippy chest-beating and mindless class war, great sport though that undoubtedly is? Rather it's an intricate jumble of memory, insight, respect, affection, identification, and even survivor's guilt. Never mind that some of us feel as if we're only a couple of paychecks from ending up back there anyway. There's the sense of not wanting to forget where you ""came from"" (maan), because this feels like betraying the people who are still there. This is why the casual contempt directed at the ""masses"" never fails to make you flinch. I always thought ""common"" was the truly offensive C-word, but it was a dark day when ""chav"" showed up – simply because it was a new way to make sneering sound respectable. These days, Horrocks might think twice about using the word ""common"", but it's fine to speak of ""chavs"" marauding around Tesco. Thing is, I remember Horrocks talking about ""Tesco Towers"" in our interview, how the commercials freed her to be more choosy with work. Then, as now, there seems nothing wrong with that – I'm sure many actors do commercials for the same reasons. It wasn't Horrocks's view, it was the charmlessness, which I know wasn't a one-off. It's easy to lampoon those who are misty-eyed for the working class. But I'd still take their good hearts any day, over those who seem to think their success is a free pass to opine on the horror and hilarity of the ""lower orders"" they once belonged to. Note to Jane Horrocks: the only people who are truly common, are those who stoop so low as to call others common – or chavs, or whatever the hate-lingo is these days. If you don't know that by now, Ms Horrocks, you're as thick as Bubbles, your character in Absolutely Fabulous. Windsor, Cartland and Ellen – now that's an A-list The latest list of the most popular baby names is out. A fascinating barometer of changing times, it's usually studied with shrieking anxiety by parents, hopeful that their children's names aren't positioned too high (too ordinary?) or too low (they're freaks!). You can tell how ""hot"" your child's name is by whether it appears on novelty key rings or drinks bottles. Adults also like to check how their own names are doing, but I have no sympathy for the once dominant, now fallen, Susans and Pauls. They have had their moment. Barbara (and variants thereon) never made it on to popular names' lists, drinks bottles or even those ceramic plaques for the bedroom door. Barbara was considered tragic and passé when I was born and remained so through many different eras. There seems no male equivalent to its enduring low-level unpopularity (Barry? Derek? Ken?). Consequently, I love my name, simply because someone has to. It's got two Bs, two Rs and three As; it means ""foreign or stranger""; what's not to like? Obviously I would appreciate a mention of Barbara in the next list, even if it is just a pity party. If only paedophilia were so simple Baroness Scotland, chair of the National Catholic Safeguarding Commission for England and Wales, and its child protection chief have said that churchgoers should take Roman Catholic priests to football matches, or invite them to have a glass of wine, as this would stop them feeling ""lonely, isolated and unsupported emotionally"" and turning into paedophiles. Hmm. This past year, abuse allegations have doubled against the Catholic church, which Baroness Scotland rightly cites as a positive sign that victims are less afraid to come forward. However, is she seriously suggesting that, if people were more sociable towards priests, the molesters wouldn't be sexually attracted to children any more? That the occasional fun night at the bingo with worshippers would be enough to unravel the complex psychosexual tangle of the average pederast? As in: ""Invite me around for Christmas drinks or the kid gets it""? It's arguable whether loneliness is a reliable indicator of paedophilia. While one could accept the direct link between loneliness and general depression, child abuse seems rather too specialised. Paedophiles often choose professions that give them access to children, also the kind of status that makes them slow to spot and hard to catch. While some may be loners, other paedophiles are gregarious and charming, duping adults as well as children. All this sounds less ""isolated"" and ""unsupported"" than chillingly well-organised. Whether such levels of sickness, calculation and cunning could be neutralised with an invitation to watch a footie match or share a glass of sancerre seems unlikely. Baroness Scotland makes a valid point about the isolation of Catholic priests, but twinning it with paedophile tendencies seems random to say the least. Conviviality is a wonderful thing, but, the last time I looked it wasn't a cure for paedophilia.","Sorry, Jane Horrocks, but it's you who's being common | Barbara Ellen",2011-07-30T23:03:02Z,Barbara Ellen,society
"It is a curious feature of American justice that Nafissatou Diallo, the accuser of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, has given an interview to ABC news, as well as to Newsweek. Thanks to media convention she had the right to anonymity in the US, as she would have had in the UK. She waived it: had that happened here, however, it still would have been sub judice, whether she was anonymous or not, so to interview her would almost certainly have been contempt of court. It is therefore, from a British perspective, strange to see someone arguing their case publicly, before it's been adjudicated. The details that are supposed to have caused the case to collapse – firstly, her immigration status, secondly, her conversation with a drug dealer who may have been her boyfriend, thirdly, her changing the order of events after the attack – are sketchy. As Holly Dustin, manager of End Violence Against Women, said, ""rape victims can have insecure immigration status … and they can still be raped""; I would think her asylum claim was as good as irrelevant. The alternative is to say that if you're a migrant who fled an ambiguous situation, if you can get into another country, good luck with that – but you forfeit your rights under the rule of law. The conversation she had in which she purportedly made compromising remarks to a drug dealer hasn't been properly translated. And as for the order of events following the alleged attempted rape: she initially said she'd waited in a corridor to collect herself; it then transpired she'd gone into a room, DSK's lawyers say to clean it, Diallo's lawyers say to collect her stuff. But even if she did clean it, how can you possibly adjudicate on what an honest person would do in the minutes following a sexual attack? Still, it's understandable that with a crime in which it's one person's word against another, the credibility of the accuser takes on greater importance than it would otherwise. What is not understandable is the fact that Diallo's credibility – which is undermined here by hints about her trustworthiness in a range of situations rather than any evidence about her sexual behaviour – comes under so much more scrutiny than Strauss-Kahn's. Indeed, where people do mention the politician's reported priapism, it is in his defence: he could have any woman he wanted, so why would he try to rape anybody? There is, as we all know, a case being brought against him for the same offence by Tristane Banon, in France. And yet in some quarters that isn't considered enough to dent his word, while Diallo's word is wrecked, not just with an inconsistency, but even when her version of events deviates from what we might have expected. I went to France shortly after DSK's arrest, and many people were shocked that I would even dignify the accusation with a conversation. ""En France, nous avons la présomption d'innocence,"" they explained slowly, as if to a person from a country without courts. But presumption of innocence is only extended to the accused. The accuser surely deserves it as well, since a false claim of rape is also a crime. So the only thing to presume in a rape accusation is that you don't yet know: yet it is taken as the respectable course to presume that the accused is still innocent. Similarly, when a charge of sexual assault is made, everything the accuser says is picked over for inconsistency and improbability. This is an extreme example, but it's a real question from someone I interviewed in Paris: ""She claims he forced her to give him head, twice. But what does that even mean? Just sticking it in twice, or two full cycles of fellatio?"" All the accused has to say is: ""It was consensual."" Nobody says: ""What exactly made her consent to sex with you? What was your killer move? Do you have a really good line, or do you just do it with your eyebrows?"" I don't even think this is pure, unadulterated sexism, a more discreet version of sharia law, in which a man is just taken to be more trustworthy than a woman. There is a legal angle, where we all know that circumstantial evidence is not enough; that tittle-tattle won't convict anyone; and that even past crimes of exactly the same, or a very similar nature, have to be excised from the process of adjudication, in the interests of fairness. A past crime from the accuser, however, even if it has nothing to do with the case in hand, is enough to torpedo their credibility. Anything could do for Diallo now: if she were found to have a speeding fine, or to have ever been a prostitute, or to be a pickpocket. Just imagine how minor an infraction would be enough to destroy any chance of her being taken seriously. And yet, for Strauss-Kahn, a tabula rasa. There is a myth that the Strauss-Kahn affair highlights the differences between American/Anglo-Saxon puritanism (the possible 72-year sentence was fixed on as evidence of a tendency to overreact) and French ""passion"". In fact, beyond a few technicalities about arrest procedure, there is less difference between them than they suppose: in the US, you might get a bit closer to a prosecution, but the rules are the same. To be a credible rape victim you need to be innocent beyond imagining, not to mention beautiful; to be a credible rapist, you have to be so vile, so rebarbative, that it would be impossible for you to get laid any other way. Diallo said when she found out who DSK was she was frightened for her life: if it had happened in Guinea, with ""a powerful man like that"", she would have been killed. In the brave western way, nobody has to silence a complainant so crudely. Incredulity is enough. • This article was amended on 29 July 2011.The sentence beginning: ""And as for the order of events ..."" omitted to make clear that the charge is ""attempted rape"".

"It says something about Lucian Freud, who died last week, that his name, turned adjective, is never going to make it into the pantheon of modern euphemisms for ""we secretly think you're fat, but we're not allowed to say that, so we'll use an art reference instead"". Other artists managed it, Rubens being the runaway winner. If Christina Hendricks (Joan from Mad Men) had a dollar for every time she was patronised as ""Rubenesque"", she could give up acting and spend the rest of her days lying by swimming pools in bikinis made of diamonds. However, in terms of celeb-speak, Freud blew it big time by painting big people with love and honesty instead of hate and condescension. He painted flesh as it really is, instead of the tidy, firm, prepubescent, plasticised matter society demands it must be. Which is why Freud – or Freudesque – never made it into the exalted heights of celeb-cum-fashion-cum-media lingo. Odd, then, that when Freud painted naked big people, such as Sue Tilley, from the £17m-selling work Benefits Supervisor Sleeping, or the performance artist Leigh Bowery, he would sometimes be criticised for exploiting them, cruelly turning them into circus show grotesques. Actually, the opposite seemed true. If anything, it was celebrities, the adored, famous and thin, who came off badly in Freud's studio. The naked Kate Moss looks like she's fallen on to a beanbag at a really boring swingers' party. The Queen resembles some depressed woman in a care home who never gets any visitors and has had a crown placed on her head to give the staff a laugh. Freud's self-portraits were the most unforgiving of all: haggard and glaring, he often resembled a pederast startled in the process of searching for internet porn. Only Jerry Hall looks vulnerable and beautiful, maybe because she was heavily pregnant and not ""Demi Moore Vanity Fair cover!"" airbrushed-pregnant, rather a swollen, ""Mick's on tour again"", cheesed-off real kind of pregnant. I don't want to cry over Freud too much. I've read that when Hall missed a few sittings, he sent her drawings of herself with bodily fluids shooting out of all her orifices. (Do I sense that he might have had some issues?) Moreover, as a male artist of a certain stature, even when criticised, he was taken very seriously, whereas the amazing Beryl Cook's spirited, warm ""fat ladies"" were too often dismissed as little more than seaside postcards. However, even those, like me, who know little about art should thank Freud for unwittingly sticking it to body fascism. I say unwittingly because clearly he had no agenda. He simply viewed his corpulent sitters as more interesting to paint than the less corpulent, just as maybe a lush foliage is more interesting to some landscape artists than tarmac or concrete. He saw humanity and truth in lots (and lots) of human flesh –and these days that carries a resonance far beyond the art world. We are living in thin-centric times when even male anorexia is on the rise, and if a woman is famous she must succumb to a flesh version of Crimewatch. (Fatwatch: will the newly thin Pauline Quirke reoffend with fatness again?) Bearing this in mind, it's maybe not so surprising that some might find Freud's paintings shocking. Here are people committing what is, in modern terms, a criminal act – being big – and he's not even bothered to pretty them up. Far from any kind of thin-centric exploitation of his subjects, Freud's method inadvertently held up a mirror to society's growing paranoia and disgust about flesh. The fact that he was ever denounced as some kind of artistic ""chubby chaser"" says far more about us than it did about him. When British decency is not enough There are to be firmer guidelines about female genital mutilation. Which is timely because summer is the season when significant numbers of British girls are taken away, ostensibly for holidays, but really to travel to Africa, the Middle East and parts of the Far East to be circumcised. In theory, this is illegal and carries 14 years of imprisonment, but in practice, while 22,000 girls are at risk each year, there have been no UK convictions. That's zero, zilch, nada, though there is plenty of heartbreaking anecdotal evidence about happy, carefree girls going on ""holiday"" and returning depressed and introverted. To their credit, everyone – from government ministers to children's groups – wants to secure convictions, as well as give assistance to victims and raise greater awareness. What may also need to happen is that British people en masse have to stop panicking about anything with ""religious"" attached. There still seems to be this embarrassment about female circumcision, because not only is it is a ""religious thing"", it is often affiliated with religions the majority of us know little about. Bizarrely, it's as if we know our ground speaking out about ""white"" religious extremes, such as polygamy in Utah, but when it comes to anything ""ethnic"", or ""other"", there is a tendency to freeze. Ironically, this hesitation to condemn comes from a good place – the part of the British psyche that rightly prides itself on respecting other cultures. However, female circumcision needs to be stripped of its religious trappings and exposed for what is – the mutilation and assault of defenceless girls. These are British children, our children, and we should be protecting them properly. Our respect for other cultures is the best part of us – but taken too literally, in this context, it does not help these girls. The curry that tikkas all the boxes Tikka masala, long vaunted as Britain's favourite curry, has come eighth in a poll, which was topped by the far hotter jalfrezi. As the poll was in Chaat! magazine (the in-house publication of the British Curry Club), this is hardly surprising. People who love curry so much that they join clubs are unlikely to pick the bastardised dish, invented in Glasgow, which entailed adding Campbell'scorrect tomato soup to placate the weedy UK palate. Arguably, all this poll proves is that tikka masala did its job well. Curry in Britain is a tale of two halves. On the one hand, there is the common weekend sight of groups of lager-swilling males, scarfing curries so hot their internal organs melt, as they gulp water straight from the jug and beg waiters to turn the fire extinguisher on them. However, there are others, including me, for whom curry eating is not an extreme sport. My curry journey started with vegetable korma, moving on to the reckless spiced heights of, erm, mild vegetable curry, perhaps with a samosa if I was feeling ""really crazy"" (OK, fine, you guessed it, I'm a heat-wimp). But even those daredevils who end up progressing to jalfrezi, madras or, dare I say, the Indian pudding menu, have to start somewhere. For many, the foothills of their Indian journey would have been the tikka masala. The vast majority of Britons couldn't cope straight off with authentic Indian food, which is why the mighty TM has always had a role to play. Mock its sticky, sickly inauthenticity all you like but for many over the years it has acted as a gateway dish for the wide-ranging delights of Indian cuisine. This is an achievement in itself.

"Phew, glad that's it all sorted! That nasty old phone-hacky business. Will the populace burst into a chorus of ""I can see clearly . . . now the rain has gone""? Not exactly. Truth. Exposure. Revelations. These are words that need to be got to the bottom of, appropriately enough, on my watch, where the buck stops. It's a firestorm of cliches. Everything has changed for ever. Or not much. It's the end of an era. Or all a smokescreen to distract us from the collapse of Europe and actual starving human beings. We keep being told that the public is not really bothered and it's not ""a doorstep issue"". Then the next minute we worry that fundamentally trust is blown in the whole establishment. Surely we are simply understanding that the establishment is a lot more than our elected representatives? A select committee cannot remedy this. A truth and reconciliation commission would find it hard going. For we are living in a splitscreen reality. For those that cared, the Murdoch show was compelling stuff; for those that didn't there were a whole lot of other channels to choose from. Undoubtedly the media is fascinated by stories about itself, even as it details and deflects the disinterest of the public in such stories. Yet however narcissistic a bunch we are, this story is bigger than us. It cuts through the arteries of influence – we are witnessing the actual haemorrhaging of power from one dynasty. But to where? It is dizzying stuff. Like an Adam Curtis documentary. Or just being extremely stoned and realising that everything is connected to everything else. All of it with terrible ""repercussions for society"". But this dizziness is not unfamiliar to me. Or you. For as each day brings forth more information about illegality and possible convictions and the intertwining of those in control, it is apparent we are being spun round. And around. Spin is what got us into this fine mess. David Cameron, the glossy product of this culture, hired a man, Andy Coulson, because he was good at spin. He ignored warnings that he may have presided over a culture of criminality. I recall several broken promises about ""the end of spin"". Remember Gordon Brown? Once he represented the end of spin for almost an entire week! A coalition government proclaimed itself as the end of spin at one point. In the early 90s MPs such as Clare Short publicly asked for the spin to stop, saying there was no point in trying to manipulate the media as it couldn't be done. Peter Kilfoyle remarked, ""It is like smoking: a very bad habit but hard to give up"" – in 1992. This need to manage perception – not simply to manage policy – is what brings the politicians and media together. With the police turning a blind eye. This is not party political: it has come to be seen as the way things have to be done. We no longer know how to do things differently. Thus we are told Ed Miliband has found his voice recently. It's a shame it's the voice of someone who talks incredibly slowly as if we are all rather idiotic five-year-olds. Is it an attempt at ""gravitas"", possibly the result of speech therapy? Those who have been media trained always remember everyone's name, take ages to say everything and try to make physical contact. Media training basically boils down to learning to breath and grope in a polite sort of way. There is nothing new or natural in this. What Miliband actually says with his new found voice – an alternative narrative still not materialised – matters less. Cameron, on the other hand, is seen to have got off because he is so good at presenting himself. He can do it for hours at a time. What for? Because he is the prime minister. Why is he? Because he can be. His substance is his self-belief that he spins into something even grander. Voiceless and always looking on the verge of tears is Nick Clegg. Yet the spin here is that this has been great for the Lib Dems as it allows them to distance themselves from the Tories. Really? Actually none of these media perceptions have made much difference to the polls. If people are convicted then Cameron may be derailed, but the actual structural change that needs to happen to stop all this corruption needs more than inquiries. To end a culture of spin you have to know where it began. Oh, with Nixon sweating under the lights, they say. Oh no, it was really Clinton who understood spin that New Labour slavishly copied. But then didn't Thatcher lower her tone? Image-making isn't new. Douglas Coupland celebrated Marshall McLuhan this week and it was he who predicted: ""Politics will eventually be replaced by imagery."" Politicians would be content to abdicate power because their images are more powerful than they could ever be. The devil is in the detail always. I refer you to the spin expert Alistair Campbell. My favourite part of his diaries are him and Mandelson having a punch-up over Blair's outfit. I loved the fact that at Camp David he writes, Blair ""had put on what was to all intents and purposes a vest"". Campbell told him he couldn't wear it ""because it's a fucking vest and you're the prime minister"". Blair had to answer serious questions to the press so Campbell then has to talk him out of ""a ghastly Nicole Farhi creation"". These then are the dark arts of presentation. Whether it's a dossier on war or a dodgy jumper. The public via the media has to be persuaded of its serious intent. Campbell also tells us that Piers Morgan saw politics as just another branch of showbusiness. With reason? The line between what matters and what doesn't appears blurred in Campbell's mind and in the real world. As the old political elite lost its self-confidence it stooped ever more lowly before the global elite. Murdoch was at its apex and national laws were meaningless to him. His empire ran its own state. That state may now be failing. Or it may go rogue. When Cameron spoke of the importance of the press being able to tell the truth to power – this is the noble cause after all – he then said: ""It is equally important that those in power can tell the truth to the press."" In some ideal world, yes. But who now is? He evaded the big questions – the truth is a malleable concept. In other words we are still being manipulated but the public may have a little more insight into the techniques of manipulation. Some are speaking as if the spell has been broken. Wait and see. New spells are being woven. Hierarchies are breaking apart, new ones forming. Technology is at the heart of this decentralisation. If information is power, is illegally obtained information illegally obtained power? If so, who now holds that power? And who are they accountable to? This may well be a period of transition. But from the inside out or the outside in, I would say we are nowhere near any such level of transparency in politics or in the media. Anyone who says otherwise is not simply spinning but downright lying.Comments on this article will be opened at 9am.",The end of spin? Don't be daft.

"At last, a real crisis. The Franco-German salvage operation for the eurozone was inevitable for the simple reason that Armageddon never happens. Nicolas Sarkozy and Angela Merkel patched together yet another ""temporary"" bail-out for the Greeks, and will do so for the Portuguese and Irish if need be. German taxpayers will pay the Greeks' bills and aid Europe's banks as they continue to profit from 20% interest on their sovereign loans. Power always wins, so long as it can get someone else to pay. A more intriguing crisis erupts in Britain. The chancellor, George Osborne, showed impressive cynicism in abandoning his opposition to a ""two-speed"" Europe and demanding that the eurozone move swiftly to fiscal union – with Britain firmly outside. Only such a union, he said, would discipline the debtor nations and thus avoid bank anarchy that would spill over into the British economy. Britain would have no part in any rescue, but it relied on the eurozone to continue on its path to ever closer union. Cynical Osborne may be, but he is right in his historical analysis. The latest Greek bailout is the moment when continental Europe finds itself forced to transmogrify from a loose federation into a brittle unitary state. If European politics starts to implode and return to xenophobia, manned borders, ethnic cleansings and trade boycotts, that start is now. This is a true turning point. From the earliest days of European union after the second world war, such a point was the greatest danger. As long as national currencies could move flexibly in a climate of free trade, Europe's extraordinarily diverse political economy could enjoy a ""variable geometry"". The safety valve of devaluation allowed countries to adjust over time. Their distinctive autonomies and political cultures could survive. That safety valve is now turning off. Huge subsidies must flow from high-performing to low-performing countries within the eurozone to pay government bills, support projects and finance sovereign debts. In their wake come bureaucratic intervention and fiscal discipline. This means harmonised taxes, harmonised enforcement, harmonised regulation and harmonised government, only distantly accountable to electorates. Once monetary union was introduced, back in 1999, the rest had to follow. Gordon Brown's greatest gift to the British nation was to face down Tony Blair in 2001-02 and stop him joining the euro. Blair regarded anything anti-European as ""hopelessly, absurdly out of date and unrealistic … a kind of post-empire delusion"". The euro was to be the culmination of his plan for European supremacy. Brown stopped it. The epitaph on this particular spat is Blair's brief and dismissive reference to the euro in his memoir, as if he was never really in favour. It is a bizarre rewriting of history. Only a fool could want Europe to return to the divisive feuds and nationalist horrors of the 19th and early-20th centuries. Any student of the Balkans knows that such horrors are never far below the surface. But a monetary union that denies nations the freedom to breathe and adjust their economies in their own way over time runs just this risk of regressive reaction. Each step towards ""ever-closer union"" has brought reaction nearer. The Single European Act of 1986 was necessary to police free trade, but the Maastricht and Lisbon treaties put in place the architecture of a federal state that has become ever more rigid and ever more unpopular. The single currency bound the politics of Europe with hoops of steel. Osborne wants those hoops to tighten further, to trap the 17 eurozone countries in a realm of unaccountable federalism, a fiscal rigidity that he must know will eventually snap. The test will be to destruction. Something must be done to get the Greeks to pay their taxes or the Germans will refuse to pay their subsidies. As Osborne says, eurobonds are needed that would require Germany to stand behind southern states' debts, but this will mean southern states accepting a ""German-designed economic policy"". Brussels must fix taxation and public spending targets on weaker euro states or bank defaults will wreck Europe's shaky economic equilibrium. Yet already attempts in Brussels to impose uniform corporation tax are tottering. How can a true fiscal union hold? We have already seen the demands of the Franco-German axis and the IMF furiously resented by ailing countries. The Greeks are rebelling in their humiliation, and the Germans are rebelling in their generosity. Across Europe the old pro-EU consensus is evaporating. The Slovakians have declined to join the euro bailout, accused by the EU commission of a ""breach of solidarity"", words reminiscent of the old Soviet Union. The latest Euro-barometer of public opinion shows for the first time that overall distrust of the EU outstrips trust, predominantly so in Britain, Germany and France. Polls show ever fewer countries regarding membership as a good thing, with opposition strongest the farther north we go. It is ominous that the politics of euroscepticism is fusing along old historical lines. When the EU was a sound trading union it was backed in Protestant northern Europe. As it slid into institutional orthodoxy and heavy cross-border transfers, its appeal shifted to the Counter-Reformation south. The high-flown language of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing's first draft of the Lisbon treaty was that of a papal encyclical. As before the Reformation, the taxing of northern Europe to sustain the subsidies and debts of mother church lasted awhile, but it could not last for ever. German taxpayers may bail out the Greeks, because half the Greeks' debts are to foreign banks. But these taxpayers will not also bail out the Portuguese, the Spaniards and the Italians. The attempted revival of the Holy Roman Empire is doomed. Luther's theses will soon be nailed to the doors not of Wittenberg but of the Berlaymont palace in Brussels. ""Ever closer union"" was always a dangerous fantasy, a top-down imperialism forged in the over-fed minds of the cardinals of a pan-European faith. It thought it could deny political reality. Its hubris lay in a belief that somehow monetary union could leave national identity untouched, that a corrupt European parliament could offer democratic accountability enough. Now the good times are over, that accountability cannot validate the awful disciplines that must be imposed on debtor nations. Vigorous domestic democracy is the one strength of Europe's postwar states. Distant discipline will not wash. Ever closer union falls squarely into the historian Barbara Tuchman's definition of a grand historical folly, ""a policy demonstrably unworkable"" and widely known as such at the time. It was a policy pursued by Europe's leaders, like so many follies before, as ""a love-child of power"". The attempt to impose fiscal union on all Europe will bring its demise. But where Osborne and his brand of scepticism are wrong is in so obviously willing this demise. When monetary union reaches breaking point and unravels in an orgy of xenophobia, Britain will not be immune from the chaos. The pocket Napoleons who embarked on this venture may meet their Waterloo. But Britain's economy is unlikely to escape the carnage.","Monetary union, always unworkable, has set in train a European disaster | Simon Jenkins",2011-07-21T20:00:06Z,Simon Jenkins,world
"So I have to write really quickly because Leveson wants the diary for his inquiry which is incredibly flattering when you think I have only been doing it for a year, as well as convenient because it is nearly full up anyway, although Anya said she would not be in any rush to buy a new one if she was me, and I was like, loving the unhesitating loyalty, girlfriend. Actually, though I will not tell Anya, I might start one of our compact mid-year 2011-2012 ones, to be on the safe side, with a matching address book because Dave says we need to start a new one with no Chippy friends, or Times friends, or trusted colleagues who have let us down in a most dreadful way, he can barely look Oik in the eye.

"More than a decade ago, the American writer Neal Gabler published Life: the Movie, arguing that events of the greatest moment – from news to high politics – had come to be experienced as mass entertainment, that we followed moments of real life as if they were merely a story played out before us, complying with an unseen script. Even before Rupert and James Murdoch appeared before a Commons committee, the hacking saga had acquired that same quality. People admit to being hooked on the story, watching the nightly news as if it were another episode on a DVD boxed set of the latest acclaimed TV drama. And this story has complied with the rules of the high-class thriller almost immaculately, with its layers of intrigue, its hint of a conspiracy going right to the heart of the nation's most powerful institutions, its low-life villains – in this case, the tabloid reporters and private detectives they hired – dominating the early episodes, gradually replaced by bigger and bigger players, until the trail of suspicion leads to the very top. If anything, the hacking story has suffered from being a tad OTT, cramming too much action, and too many eye-popping characters, into too little time. Most dramatists would be happy with a plot that unmasked skulduggery inside the world's most powerful media organisation. That would be plenty. But this one has taken in the Metropolitan police, felling the commissioner and one of his most senior lieutenants, and seems to be getting ever closer to Downing Street. Resignations that, if they had come singly would have dominated the news for a week, have come in clusters, with three of the biggest last weekend. The pace has been dizzying. Today saw a climax of sorts, albeit with a set-piece scene that seemed to have been written for the stage, rather than TV. Facing an inquisitorial panel of MPs was a media mogul once deemed omnipotent on several continents. That fact alone was dramatic: the Wizard of Oz brought before the munchkins, forced to defend himself from the MPs he had once intimidated and disdained. Before the low – and contemptible – act of pantomime, the attempted foaming, this was a tableau bursting with drama, both public and curiously domestic. So yes, we had a global corporate titan forced to explain himself. But we also had a young wife in a bright pink jacket, nervously watchful and protective of her much older husband. The video of her right hook on the foam-pie assassin was played for laughs in some TV coverage, but it looked like an eruption of tension that had been bottled up for nearly three hours. Wendi Deng won plaudits, even from her husband's most dogged accusers: she was the Tiger Mother, defending her man. More epic still, almost Shakespearean, was the dynamic between father and son: Rupert placing his hand on his son's arm, as he sought to interrupt; James, anxiously watching his father floundering, desperately trying to intervene and take over. Cynics wondered if the whole show was phoney – if old man Rupe was faking semi-senility under Tom Watson's questioning in order to extract sympathy and make credible his claim to have been in the dark about the NoW's darkest practices. He did rally remarkably as the session went on, remembering circulation figures from the mid-1990s and alive to the legal meaning of the phrase ""wilful blindness'. (One recalled Ernest Saunders, who avoided full punishment for the Guinness affair by an apparent lapse into Alzheimer's disease, from which he miraculously recovered.) The effect of all this was, incredibly, to make Rupert Murdoch – for decades the villain of left-leaning nightmares – a figure of vulnerability, even pity. By the end, the MPs were praising the old man's guts for turning up. But that may not cut much ice with News Corp investors: indeed, what we may have witnessed in the cramped Wilson room of Portcullis House was the last hurrah of Keith Rupert Murdoch and the de facto transition to his son. James, with his transatlantic business patois – all ""pro-active"", ""going forward"" and ""financial quantum"" ie cost – drove journalists mad, but it will have reassured the money men, persuading them that it's time for a generational shift. If Murdoch Snr lost his power to scare, then what remained of the reputation of the Metropolitan police was pushed further into the mire. Each one of the Met trio who appeared sought to shove the blame onto the desk of a colleague claiming that they had barely done anything wrong, which was curious given that two of the three had resigned. The revelation that 10 of the Met's 45 press officers were ex-employees of News International, coupled with the utterly casual way in which Neil Wallis, the former deputy editor of the News of the World, was hired, only confirmed that Scotland Yard and the newspaper group had become so intertwined, the force had come to resemble NI's security wing. As for the politicians, it was a good day for parliament – feeling its strength as if for the first time. Now that MPs have grilled the powerful before the gaze of the world's media – as their US congressional counterparts have done for years – they might develop a taste for it. If they do, they will need to sharpen up their interrogation skills. Watson delivered a masterclass, asking short, precise questions that bamboozled Murdoch Snr utterly. But too many of the rest were vague and general, allowing James to regurgitate the Harvard Business School textbook and run out the clock. Which brings us to the man not there but whose fate may depend on these events. The most excitable commentators – and interestingly these have been Conservative bloggers rather than Guardian types – have wondered if this crisis could end with the toppling of David Cameron. They have been tweeting away merrily about who might follow, with some MPs said to be ""buying shares"" in Theresa May. My own view remains sceptical: what we know so far certainly damages Cameron – making him guilty of extremely poor judgment in hiring a man who had to quit the NoW over hacking – but it does not yet threaten his survival. That said, two developments could hurt him very badly. The first was the revelation that Wallis had acted as an informal adviser to Andy Coulson even once Coulson was installed at Cameron's side. That means that the NoW was not in Coulson's past, as Cameron has always insisted, but that the connection lingered. Now everyone will want to know what advice Wallis gave: did he pass on valuable information on Labour that had been acquired illegally? If he did, that would surely be terminal for Cameron. Nor does the email exchange between his chief of staff and the Met, released yesterday, help. It suggests a degree of collusion between the Met and Downing Street that, even if designed to keep the PM safely out of the loop, looks suspect. The Camerons spent a recent holiday watching DVDs of the compelling Danish political drama, The Killing.

"When President Obama, the supreme rationalist, says that there are just days to avert Armageddon, everyone should sit up and listen. For months, Republicans have used their new majority in the House of Representatives to block any move to lift the artificial cap on the amount the US government can borrow. If by this Friday they still refuse – insisting on up to $4trillion of spending cuts, excluding defence, and no tax increases as the price of their support – then the US will be unable to service its public debts. The biggest economy on Earth will default. The results will be catastrophic, argues JP Morgan chief executive Jamie Dimon – a warning repeated by Obama. The US government will have to start to wind down: soldiers' wages and public pensions alike will be suspended. But in the financial markets there will be mayhem. Interest rates will shoot up and there will be a flight from the dollar. Banks, uncertain about their expected income from their holdings of US Treasury bonds and bills, will call in their loans, creating a second credit crunch. Some may collapse. Even to get days away from such a prospect, says Obama, will now have costs: every creditor to the US has been shaken to the core by American politicians not taking their responsibilities as borrowers seriously. They will exact a higher price for lending in future, even if a bargain is struck now. But the Democrats cannot agree to the Republicans' absolutist demands, in part because the arithmetic of deficit reduction does not work without tax increases and cuts in defence spending, in part because they passionately believe that with taxes the lowest for 50 years, the US's rich should share in the pain and in part because in any human exchange there is an element of horse-trading. The Republicans want to suspend the rules by which not just Washington but any political system operates. They want to be political winners who take all, risking even the collapse of the US economy to get their way. Yet even though their sums do not add up, they will not budge. They are immovable. Steve King, an ultra-conservative from Iowa, says that warnings from Wall Street's finest are ""empty threats"". Others, elected as Tea Party candidates last November, consider they have been told by God to pursue the holy mission of rolling back the insidious and demoralising advance of the federal government. Taxation is the illegitimate confiscation of honest citizens' hard-earned dollars; in a perfect world, there would be a tiny state, close to no taxation and no regulation. Americans must confront the reality that their country is allegedly bankrupt, a situation they say is created by irresponsible Democrat politicians and their allies, false Republicans. ""Real Republicans"" don't blink. President Obama has tried to fashion a bargain with a collection of rightwing politicians that most in Washington regard as both mad and dangerous. Yet, after months of talking, the Republicans will not offer to bargain, causing President Obama to walk out of the talks last Thursday in pure exasperation. It says a lot about American politics and culture that such a passionate minority believes that it can defy not just American political tradition but also the normal terms of trade that define human association. Everyone expects there to be a compromise at one minute to midnight on the very last day. I am not so sure. These are politicians who in some respects have more in common with Islamic religious fundamentalists than the Enlightenment tradition which gave birth to western democracy. The Tea Party sees neither virtue nor integrity in any position but their own. Nor do many of their number want to build political careers. They have been sent by God and their electors to bring down Washington. There has always been this fundamentalist strand in US life, but what has inflamed it over the last decade is a twofold process – a wrong-headed understanding of why US economic pre-eminence is being challenged, closely linked to the breakdown of a public realm in which ideas are discussed, traded and exchanged in a climate which respects argument. The abolition of the Fairness Doctrine in 1987, which required all broadcasters fairly to represent all points of view, has created a mass media shouting, ranting, sloganising and overwhelmingly from the political right. The leader in the charge is Rupert Murdoch's Fox News, a TV channel with an audience of 100 million in which all news and comment have to be shoehorned – subtly in its news operation and overtly in its commentary – into a conservative worldview. It operates, as the former White House communications director Anita Dunn has said, ""as either the research or communications arm of the Republican party"". Leading Republican stars such as Mike Huckabee or Sarah Palin are on its payroll. Its political shows pull no punches: the hosts are hard-line Republicans. If Fox News were to permit the case for tax increases to be fairly reported or discussed it would not be doing its job. Murdoch, refusing in a Fox News interview last week even to discuss the News of the World, would be displeased. No explanation of the Tea Party ""Real Republican"" intransigence over the debt talks is possible without understanding how its political base has been constructed and sustained. But the damage goes well beyond the US getting so close to debt default. It makes rational discussion of wider US policy options close to impossible. Like reporters in the Soviet Union or China, Fox News journalists have to parrot an ideological line: the US economy's dynamism is rooted entirely in sturdy, enterprising, God-fearing individuals threatened only by federal taxes and regulation. Thus the Republican negotiating stance. Navigating an economy through the aftermath of a credit crunch with a mountainous legacy of private debt and crippled banking systems is enormously difficult. On top, there is the spectre of the implosion of the euro. Yet in the US – and to a degree in Britain – the political right is implacably opposed to the creative public action that in the past has been crucial to success in such circumstances. It is already clear that even if the US avoids default in the weeks ahead, the price will be to so cramp the US government that it can do little or nothing. Mr Murdoch is apologising this weekend for the behaviour of his papers over phone-hacking.

"So it has been slightly unyay because we totally trusted Perkins until she said she was tendering her resignation on account of Chequers never having sunk so low, even with the Blairs.

"And in other news, it was announced that romantic literature has failed lamentably in providing women with contraceptive advice. In a widely noticed piece for the Journal of Family Planning and Reproductive Health Care, a Ms Susan Quilliam, gifted self-publicist and ""sexual health professional"", argued that a cavalier attitude towards safe sex in romantic fiction correlates, ""worryingly"", with negative attitudes to condom use among female readers. Leave aside, for now, the fact that the solitary study in which Quilliam encountered this correlation proves nothing about romantic fiction and safe sex – keen readers will find it hard to quarrel with her central point, that these novels supply fewer pointers on reproductive matters than do manuals written by sexual health professionals. Equally, unless there have been great changes recently, the latter contain little by way of plot, character, narrative and suspense, but as Quilliam points out, it is the very escapism of romantic fiction that fosters psychosexual problems. ""While,"" she allows, ""there is much more real-life awareness nowadays – female characters have jobs, male characters are sensitive and sensible, both face challenges such as addiction, disability, single parenting or domestic violence – still a deep strand of escapism, perfectionism and idealisation runs through the genre."" And not just through that genre – much more damaging, concerned parents might think, is the complete disregard for reproductive health awareness in literature for younger readers. Perhaps we can forgive this carelessness in a story such as The Hobbit, though its publication coincided with a good deal of unsafe sex; or The Secret Garden, despite the charged relationship between Mary and Dickon. But considering her obvious affection and respect for young adults and the importance of early intervention, it is unfortunate that JK Rowling neglected to squeeze even one lesson about sexual health into Harry Potter's Hogwarts timetable. Unsurprisingly, in the later books, we find the 17-year-old alumni, often roaming the world in small, unaccompanied gangs, placing themselves at considerable risk. Recall the scene in a tent, more fully explored in the last film, where Hermione dances with Harry? Only memories of Ron Weasley appears to stand between Hermione and the strong possibility of a teen wizard pregnancy. With luck, Rowling will read Quilliam and take the opportunity, in her new website, Pottermore, to address this oversight, even if it is only with a new spell – condomiamus, say, or a delayed papilloma vaccination for Hermione, although parents would probably prefer a dedicated new teacher, tasked with sexual health education throughout the academy. Ideally, following Quilliam's intervention, we can look forward to a flowering of fictional sexual responsibility, in all genres, with authors routinely combining escapism with contraceptive best practice. In fact, a concerned sexual health professional – let us call her Susan – could make a fine heroine as she juggles single-parenting with the delaying of longed-for consummation with a lover who, Darcy-like, must learn to recognise the value of appropriate protection in a respectful relationship of equals. And, presumably, although Quilliam does not propose it, male-targeted literature ought also to promote caring sexual behaviour. It would be the work of a moment, for example, for an editor to persuade John le Carré to update his novels with a few scenes in which Smiley, in a brief moment of optimism, makes a precautionary visit to a chemist or directs a reluctant fellow spook to the nearest STD clinic. Pending the arrival of this material, Quilliam's preference, given a choice between no reading and an epidemic of Bovarysme, is for no reading, at least for weak, giddy types likely to have their heads turned. ""I do think that if readers start to believe the story that romantic fiction offers,"" says Quilliam, ""they store up trouble for themselves – and then they bring that trouble into our consulting rooms."" Like fellow campaigner, Margaret Oliphant, she sees all too clearly the damage caused by sensation fiction, whose women ""give and receive burning kisses and frantic embraces and live in a voluptuous dream"". Many of today's women readers being, it seems, no less silly and sentimental than Oliphant's were in 1867, Quilliam counsels her fellow sex professionals: ""Sometimes, the kindest and wisest thing we can do for our clients is to encourage them to put down the books – and pick up reality."" But the stuff is everywhere. How can the woman instructed to say no to Mills and Boon, to chicklit, even to AS Byatt, be stopped from falling back on Jane Austen, gaining false ideas about social advancement through romance, then descending. by degrees, into depravity, social exclusion and the queue for Quilliam's consulting room? With general illiteracy still a work in progress, it must help that the Conservative are moving so quickly to destroy the lending libraries which have, for generations, been a principal source of this romantic nuisance. ""Close your library and save 10 local women from unplanned pregnancy,"" is probably the closest the abject libraries minister, Ed Vaizey is likely to get to a rallying cry. Too bad for Quilliam, however, and Vaizey, that her paper coincided with another diagnosis, by a fellow psychologist, to the effect that fiction is actually good for you. Promoting his new book Such Stuff as Dreams: The Psychology of Fiction on Radio 4 last week, Professor Keith Oatley, said that reading fiction assisted people's ""social understanding"" and helps, in the manner of a flight simulator, with the development of empathy: ""The more time you spend, the better you are at understanding other people"". Consider that Ed Miliband, the robotic, goggling fratricide, reads no novels, because they are ""all made up"", and it makes quite a lot of sense. On the other hand, would he have been more human if he'd read Watership Down? How much reading does the cultivation of empathy require? Given that, professors of English and literary critics ought, following their years of total fictional immersion, to be models of social understanding and empathy, a conclusion you would be hard put to draw from contributions to the TLS or LRB letters pages. And most perplexing – how do you account for a person such as Ed Vaizey, who claims to be a great reader and watches, the picture of indifference, as British libraries are killed off or handed over to untrained volunteers for gradual dismembering? By rights, the simplest, most cautionary fiction should tell him that he will be despised for ever more. Unless we can trace his glib philistinism to a weakness for Jeffrey Archer. To award literature a healthful, utilitarian value, as much as it might appeal to humanities departments eager to claim ""impact"" for this officially useless discipline, is as risky a proposition, surely, as to damn it for corrupting the female mind. Champion fiction because it is good for you, or ban it because it is bad for you and, either way, before long, you'll end up with a piece in a newspaper saying it makes you fat. As well as being a completely useless contraceptive.","But Mr Darcy, shouldn't we be taking precautions? | Catherine Bennett",2011-07-09T23:06:00Z,Catherine Bennett,uk
"Say what you like, this does finally give meaning to David Cameron's ""we're all in this together"" catchphrase. Whether the members of Britain's necrotic establishment are wading in it, or are up to their necks in it, will be a matter for you to call. But what an irony that Murdoch tabloids, infrequently righteous in their crusades, have finally been shown what major corruption looks like. It's not a couple of swingers daring to live an unconventional lifestyle in a Wilmslow terrace – it was in the mirror all along. Yet the solemn announcement that the News of the World is dead (long live the Sun on Sunday!) does not indicate the Murdoch-controlled culture that has debased this septic isle for decades has been dismantled. This week, people have beheld MPs saying what they actually think about Britain's most obscenely powerful unelected foreign tax exile, and marvelled as if they had seen unicorns. That gives you some idea of the scale of the clean-up, and unless all manner of establishment drones get brave and stay brave, revulsion over the corruption of public life by Murdoch and his soldiers will go the same way as that pertaining to bankers or MPs' expenses. People are right to be revolted. It is revolting. Indeed, there are so many threads that we should don rubber gloves and follow merely one of them for a flavour of the whole. So, do open your textbooks at ""war"". Rupert Murdoch was the only figure powerful enough to be able to state explicitly, without consequence, that he was backing war on Iraq to bring down the price of oil. So his ""free press"" all cheer-led for said war, and began commodifying their version of it, even confecting their own military award ceremonies as though the medal system were inadequate. The whitewashing report into the death of a scientist who questioned the basis for that war was mysteriously leaked to Murdoch's papers – another WORLD EXCLUSIVE – while others in his pay hacked the phones and emails of those casualties of war being repatriated in bodybags, to be monetised as stories all over again. Any complaint about this must be taken before an industry court presided over not by the kangaroo of Rupert's native Australia, but an even less engaged selection of backscratching editors, including his own. What a country we do live in. My apologies for repeating sentiments voiced in this column many times – as a recovering Murdoch employee, my sponsor insists I share thrice-weekly – but this is a land where a change in prime ministers constitutes the mere shuffling of Rupert's junior personnel. Anyone in doubt as to exactly how dirty a little secret Murdoch has always been is reminded that despite Margaret Thatcher being so close that they repeatedly Christmassed together at Chequers, she does not once even mention him in her memoirs. Not once! Like Voldemort, he must not be named. And such yuletide bunk-ups continued down the years, via the Blairs, all the way to the PM's festive supper with Rebekah Brooks barely six months ago. Perhaps Cameron will now de-BFF the News International boss. He certainly ought to. My friend Matthew is fond of quoting the legendary Manchester Guardian critic Neville Cardus, who never took tea with the notional enemy because ""to do so would be to dilute the purity of my hatred"". Clearly, we can't all be haters, and a certain amount of friendliness between press and parliament is necessary and beneficial. But you can't really kitchen sup with long spoons, and Britain would be a better place if politicians and journalists picked a lane and stuck to it, instead of pursuing the furtive, corrosive form of backscratching realpolitik which has got us where we are today. Until then, historians assessing this period will find even cabinet papers infinitely less revealing than guest lists. Within the placements of cosy parties in the Cotswolds lie many unpalatable answers. Perhaps they will ask themselves why tragedy-stricken Gordon Brown felt he had to invite a clutch of tabloid editors to the funeral of his baby daughter. If they find that conundrum too ghastly to contemplate, they might question quite why Brown asked the then Sun columnist Richard Littlejohn to his wedding. Fear, presumably. It certainly isn't Richard's charm. Yet did it save Brown from the inevitable Sun evisceration? Of course not. This is a relationship that has only ever worked one way. Forget America – Murdoch's empire is the one with which this country has long nurtured its most ""special relationship"", which has thus far always ended in tears for the prime minister of the day, and by extension for the country. So the outcry finally inspired by Nick Davies's heroic pursuit of the truth is a heart-soaring start, but it is still only a start. Turning it into a new dawn will take a courage which none of the main party leaders have shown before this very week, when not doing so would have been political suicide. As it seeks to power through the BSkyB purchase, News Corp will, by hook or by crook, attempt to begin collecting on the complex implicit deals it made with them and others.

"When Rupert Murdoch bought the News of the World from its ancestral owners, the Carr family, in 1969 he called it ""the biggest steal since the Great Train Robbery"". Now it has turned and bit the hand that did the stealing. The paper was Murdoch's first big acquisition, a prelude to the Sun and the Times. But the glory soon passed when he serialised the Christine Keeler memoirs and found himself ostracised socially and excoriated politically. This experience so shocked him that he turned against Britain, went to America and let the paper do its worst to the British establishment. Since the recent revelations of phone hacking the same British establishment has turned on Murdoch and his empire with a gleeful and often hysterical vengeance. One might think that no other media group ever intruded or transgressed any press code of ethics. But Murdoch's response has been drastic. He is closing down the News of the World for good, trying like Lady Macbeth to eradicate the ""damned spot"" that seems to sully all his current ambition. The game on which he embarked 42 years ago may have made him piles of money, but it has proved more trouble than it is worth. The loss of any newspaper is sad for any who value press diversity. But the ""news of the screws"" will surely not be missed. Under the Carrs it had a careless radicalism, usually taking the form of not minding whom its intrusions on private life offended. Today its contact with the world of public debate, with politics or economics, has become minimal. It seemed to rely on Max Clifford and others to feed it material, including eavesdroppers, and it feasted as much on the misfortunes of the unknown – vicars and minor actors – as on celebrities. It has been near impossible to find anything of substance in its total preoccupation with sex. Whether Murdoch can draw a line under this disaster to his reputation only time will tell. His bid to take over the remaining shares in BSkyB – over which a measure of government discretion still hovers – is certainly worth more than the ailing revenue from the News of the World. James Murdoch's statement in closing the paper last night was as repentant as it was possible to be. But this will be a suppurating wound.

"I remember it as a rat-infested dump. Water dripped down walls. Wires hung from ceilings. Pigeons colonised turrets and rafters. Gormenghast could not do justice to the profile of that destitute old lady, slumped at the far end of Euston Road. Poor St Pancras hotel embodied the contempt of modernism for anything old, stylish, romantic and, above all, Victorian. The place should be left to rot, an example to any who might find beauty in antiquity or economy in restoration. Thirty years ago I staged a ""flash"" party in the derelict staircase of St Pancras, to draw attention to its plight. British Rail and its architects had fought for years to demolish it in favour of a new King's Cross in the style of Euston. So we crammed the flights of steps with rail enthusiasts, put trumpeters on the landings and toasted the old lady with champagne. Valiant campaigners from the Victorian Society led by John Betjeman and others had managed to get the building listed, but at the time it seemed at risk of collapse. Nobody cared.     Illustration by Satoshi Kambayashi    Last month St Pancras hotel finally reopened to defy the forces of darkness. It is restored to its old magnificence, courtesy of three noble firms, London and Continental, Manhattan Lofts and Marriott hotels. The finest booking hall in Europe clinks with cocktails. The murals on the old staircase throb with colour. Arches leap across corridors and gilt drips from vaulting. Victorian restaurants, bedrooms and bars are booked solid. Sometimes, just sometimes, beauty wins. By happy coincidence, next week also marks the bicentenary of the birth of the creator of St Pancras, Sir George Gilbert Scott. He was the most prolific architect of his age, and possibly of all time, and also the most unsung. His works spanned the empire, from New Zealand to Newfoundland. In England alone, he designed 800 buildings and oversaw hundreds more restorations. He produced churches, schools, hospitals, workhouses, asylums and vicarages galore. He has 607 structures listed as historic, more than any other architect (next is Lutyens, with 402), including the Albert Memorial, the Foreign Office, Edinburgh Cathedral and the universities of Glasgow and Bombay. Scott restored 18 of the 26 English medieval cathedrals. From his office his grandson, Giles, designed Liverpool Cathedral, Battersea power station, red phone boxes and what is now Tate Modern. Scott towered over his profession, yet he has no biography. At least the Victorian Society has done him the honour of a celebratory magazine, adorned with a picture of Scott's great colonnade at Bombay university in rich Venetian gothic. The issue is more than a hymn of praise. It seeks to explain the role of taste in governing the changing appreciation of historic style. For decades, as Ian Dungavell points out, Scott was seen as a vandal, ""the bête noire of the society for the protection of ancient buildings"", for what was seen as his over-restoration of medieval churches. This helped fuel hostility to Victorian architecture through most of the 20th century. When Scott died, his enemy William Morris hailed ""the happily dead dog"". The Victorian Society has recovered Scott's reputation not as a destroyer of old buildings but as their scholarly rescuer. He was a meticulous lover of medieval architecture, reinstating hundreds of medieval churches in the manner in which he envisaged their builders had intended. He confronted an Anglican inheritance that had been neglected and was on the verge of collapse. He had to rebuild Chichester cathedral tower after it actually fell down, and used hydraulic rams to prop up St Albans Abbey. As Gavin Stamp points out, ""Scott treated buildings with careful, loving respect and intuitive structural knowledge"", so as to put them back to the use for which they were designed. At one derelict site after another, he had his assistants comb the ground to find fragments of medieval stone to re-erect and copy. He was a devoted follower of Pugin, giving him pride of place in the parade of architects on the Albert Memorial, with his own profile carved, diminutive, behind him. Morris's attack was unfair. Scott merely rejected Morris's authenticity of material in favour of authenticity of style. Had it not been for him, hundreds of English churches would today be ruins, stabilised in the picturesque wreckage beloved of the old ministry of works, with fragmented walls and gaunt gables set in immaculate government lawns. Scott was certainly a partial gothicist. His argument with Palmerston in 1858 over the design for a new Foreign Office in Whitehall saw an epic ""battle of the styles"". Palmerston pitted his imperial classicism against Scott's city-state medievalism. The plans passed through a compromise byzantine before coming to rest on the present Italian renaissance. Rarely was meaning in architecture subjected to such furious public debate, battle being joined in the press and in parliament, those being the days. A Tory minister, Geoffrey Rippon, tried to demolish the building as ""obsolete"" in 1963 but was stopped. I love St Pancras but see Scott's Albert Memorial as a more exquisite masterpiece. Restored by English Heritage in 1998, it is England's Taj Mahal, encasing the golden statue of Victoria's departed Albert in a soaring shrine in honour of western civilisation. Promenaders arriving at the Albert Hall next week should turn awhile from that pompous bosom of a building and admire this supreme work of gothic art. Catch it above all as an imperial sun sets across Kensington Gardens. What the neglect of Scott illustrates is how fickle is the eye of fashion. The dirt that came to encase his buildings, much of whose appeal lay in ornament and colour, was mistaken for ugliness. His attempt to rescue old buildings was seen as philistine, and judged worthless. Anything to do with the medieval revival was regarded as pastiche. The contrasting blank facades and unadorned interiors of 20th-century modernism were seen as clean, socialist and virtuous. All architecture is a pastiche of something, none more so than today's ""neo-modernist"" revival. Scott was wholly up to date in his use of such materials as steel, concrete, plate glass and the technology of steam. He even put a modern bathroom on each floor at St Pancras. But he understood the spiritual exhilaration of the vertical line, the pointed arch and the soaring turret. In an age of relentless novelty, he understood that architecture could reassure people, that buildings could perform new uses yet offer comfort in continuity. What was sad in the campaign to save St Pancras was the absence from it of Scott's own profession of architect, to which anything old is a nuisance and anything new is a fee. Anyone wishing to see what today's architects preferred need only trot down the road to Euston station, a building with no respect for any style past or present, indeed with no sense of visual delight at all. I gather it is to be demolished. I have struggled to see Euston as the St Pancras of our age but failed. If there is a ""save Euston"" society being formed, I am afraid it is not for me. • This article was amended on 12 July 2011.

"Living alone costs an extra £3,500 a year. And what do you get for your money? More time to read and stare out of the window; the ability to make a reasonable inventory of what's in your fridge, knowing that no bugger has been at your picnic eggs; the freedom to walk about naked. You could probably find a housemate who would accept all these things for much less than £3.5k. If only we could import a few honest values of the marketplace into the hearth, things would be so much more efficient. This news story falls into a category with ""Childlessness causes breast cancer"" and ""Children of divorce more likely to suffer mental health problems"". There's a faux-innocent tone, ""don't yell at me, I'm only passing on the facts"", which is hard to argue: these are merely facts. But just as you would never have a child in order to avoid cancer, and just as a desire for one's children to enjoy sound mental health would probably not be enough to avert marital breakdown, so the causal link here – between living alone and spending more – might be sound, but its proportions are off. And nobody thinks you could use a calculator to decide who to live with: a story like this isn't for the purposes of information; its purpose is to concatenate behaviour that runs against the norm with negative consequence. Solitary living has fluctuating status, according to how old you are and, to a lesser degree, your sex. If you're young, it's taken to be a sign of success, since materially it is. As we can see it's very expensive, so if you can undertake it under 30, you must be on a fast track to somewhere. A quotation often attributed to (though never said by) Thatcher – ""a man who, beyond the age of 26, finds himself on a bus, can count himself a failure"" – distills this belief, which might be why it's stuck in the national psyche. The ambitious young person wants a private space in which to determine his or her direction of travel – collectivisation is for losers. But communal living among the young is acceptable as well. So many people do it, after all, and seem to enjoy it and remember it fondly afterwards; it would be a myopic culture that sought to portray university halls as temples of failure. Even rich people live on top of one another until they're 25. By the time you're in your 30s, your living arrangements are much more proscribed. Communal living in mature adulthood is incredibly eccentric, somewhere between keeping llamas and being polyamorous. Single living is suddenly frowned on, especially for women. Unfairly, pets also suffer the taint of failure here: the primetime comedy trope, endlessly recycled, of the spinster living alone with her cats is often needlessly insulting to the cat, as if a better class of feline would find a family to live with. Men can get away for longer in their bachelor pads, but again, age tarnishes the image – at 40 you're living the dream, at 50 you're just a lonely guy with incredibly long toenails. If we accept that having a family is the desired norm, a lot of these preconceptions are based round the trajectory that culminates in procreation: you become financially secure, and prove it by having your own place; you attract a mate, and prove that by making them live with you; you have kids, and then live in a nuclear three- or foursome. But there is so much that is arguable, here, which is never argued. Even leaving aside that central structure – the primacy of childbearing, which may be hardwired but surely a sophisticated mind should be able to unwire it – why is living alone considered lonely when a) a lot of people like it, and b) the loneliest way to live in the recorded history of mankind is with one other person who you don't get on with? And why is living communally never considered, outside education, nursing homes and sitcoms? I don't think one's domestic identity changes that much over time – if you are temperamentally suited to an eight-strong house when you're 20, I bet you are at 40. It's because a respectable household has to do more than just propagate the species; the other footfall of cultural expectation concerns money. What would your domestic arrangement look like, at each phase of your life, if money were no object? Since living like sardines is cheaper, status attaches to small households – the fewer of you there are, the more successful you must be. I find myself in the irksome position of agreeing with a member of government, housing minister Grant Shapps, who said this week that so-called mates mortgages could be the solution to the insurmountable costs facing first-time buyers. Why not buy a house with friends? Why haven't we been doing this for years? For too long, status has come before preference. Those of us who'd prefer to live in gangs have instead paired off into twos, lemming-like in our conformity, but in the outcome, in our small, traditional households, un-lemminged. People who prefer to live alone at least have the independence of spirit to do so; £3,500 is a small price to pay for a mind of your own.","Living alone is pricey, but all households have their cost | Zoe Williams",2011-07-06T20:30:02Z,Zoe Williams,uk
"There could hardly have been a more telling testimony of our national plight. Last week, China's premier, Wen Jiabao, and David Cameron announced £1.4bn of orders for British goods. A day later in Germany, Wen and Angela Merkel announced more than £10bn orders for Germany. We just don't produce enough goods and services that the Chinese – or anybody else – want to buy. Germany is in the middle of a second ""wirtschaftswunder"" – economic miracle – with industrial production climbing by 15% over the last 12 months. By contrast, Britain's industrial production stutters along, growing at a mere 2.5%. However, the high-level meeting between the prime minister, chancellor, deputy prime minister, governor of the Bank of England and chair of the Financial Services Authority at Number 10 on Friday morning was not about industry and growth. Instead, it was about dealing with Britain's monstrously oversized financial sector and, more particularly, about the choices it has made – how it lends and to whom. Our banks, says last week's Financial Stability Review, have outstanding loans of £7 trillion, more than four times our GDP. But only 5% of that lending is to UK companies, the core, you might have thought, of a banking system's business. More than three times that amount has been lent in euros to borrowers in Europe, which, if the eurozone collapses amid widespread defaults by countries such as Greece, would provoke a second banking crisis, the subject of the meeting at Number 10. British banks like to talk of their ""risk appetite"" and lending in ways that are ""capital-lite"", as Lloyds' strategic review, which came with a further 15,000 of job losses, did last week. This means they do not lend to high-growth, innovative British companies. That requires more capital and management, even if the wider economic benefits are huge. Instead, they prefer, as Lloyds graphically set out, to offer small- and medium-sized companies ""capital-lite"" but fee-intensive advice on ""cash management, general insurance, pension and wealth management"". Better to use scarce capital to lend, say, to Irish property companies or French banks who in turn lend to Greece. For decades, governments have indulged these choices; to interfere would be to ""politicise"" banking. But it is profoundly political how banks use their capital and their judgments on what constitute risk. If, in extremis, they get their judgments wrong, the taxpayer has to bail them out, which is why governments must concern themselves in what banks do. Nor is it just a question of bank bailouts – one reason we have so little to sell to China is because of the choices our banks have made. Bluntly, they won't put enough of their precious capital behind British innovative enterprise. Over the next few months, a rare chance for change is presenting itself. Tomorrow is the last day to make submissions to the Independent Commission on Banking, chaired by Sir John Vickers. Its job is to recommend reforms so the taxpayer never has to bail out banks again, but it is also charged not to damage the advantage Britain allegedly enjoys by having a gigantic City of London. If Britain is serious about trying to reproduce Germany's success, it would be seizing this opportunity to reform finance, hardly a new complaint. Committees and commissions have identified the same problem for close to a century. The Vickers commission could yet be a tremulous start. In its interim report, it balked at some of the braver and more radical ideas – breaking up our banks that have become too big to fail or separating out the high-risk, investment banking arms that are cross-subsidised by the rest of the bank. Instead, it came up with a much milder idea. It proposes ""ringfencing"" different parts of banks' operations while requiring them to hold more capital. The bigger the buffer, the safer the bank. Vickers hopes this might make safer the parts of the banking system which are important to the economy. But in a submission that the Work Foundation, supported by National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts, is preparing for the banking commission, Paul Nightingale and myself argue that it could also transform the risks and rewards from lending to high-growth small- and medium-sized companies. In the current regime in which a bank has a multiple of choices, naturally it will use its scarce capital to get the maximum return – and that will not be supporting innovative companies when there are lush rewards in the exotic demimonde of shadow banking. A bank such as RBS under the domineering leadership of Fred Goodwin would overtly use the capital and deposits in its bread-and-butter high-street business – implicitly guaranteed by the taxpayer – to make massive punts trading all kinds of rubbish. But once that business option is denied it by a ringfence (better still a formal separation, but that is not on the table), suddenly lending to small- and medium-sized companies has to compete, not with the high-risk profits from investment banking, but with more humdrum forms of lending with their associated lower returns. It becomes more attractive to invest time and effort to develop a banking business that supports wealth-generating companies – rather like the Co-operative and the Swedish Handelsbanken, now expanding at huge speed in Britain. Equally, investment banking becomes exposed for what it is: a high-risk business dependent upon cross-subsidy from the rest of the bank and taxpayers to generate otherwise impossibly high returns and their associated bonuses. It will require more capital still. It should be no surprise that Vickers and his team are under enormous pressure to make their proposed ringfence as porous and soft as possible. Last week, Andrew Tyrie, chair of the Treasury committee, expressed his concern that the banks were doing deals and lobbying behind closed doors. He wants everything out in the open. Vickers holds two formidable aces. The first is that the chancellor has publicly backed the idea of a ringfence, so for him to propose anything weaker than Vickers is a political impossibility. The second is that the banks themselves are divided over the proposition. HSBC endorses the idea, as will the Co-operative and probably Santander. Lloyds would accept it as the price for having to sell off less of its branch network.Implacably opposed are RBS and Barclays, for whom a tough ringfence represents an existential challenge to their business model. Barclays is doubtless telling the government it might move to New York, RBS that a ringfence threatens its capacity to return to profitability and thus successfully recouping the government's stake. For the UK, the choice is no less existential. Tough ringfencing and more capital are not magic bullets that alone solve the problem, but they are preconditions for a better banking system. So what is it to be? Investment banker bonuses or the foundations of a more enterprising Britain? A lot hangs on the next few months.",British bankers are still gambling while small businesses go to the wall | Will Hutton,2011-07-02T23:07:11Z,Will Hutton,uk
"The creator of London's Gherkin, Ken Shuttleworth, likes to think of his work as ""outrageous"". ""I'd rather have controversy,"" the architect once said, ""than produce a dull, boring building that nobody comments on."" Unesco duly commented, when it was finished, on the unfortunate way Shuttleworth's huge, flashy edifice eclipsed a humble, if quite sweet little relic called the Tower of London, a world heritage site. Conservationists were disappointed that it replaced the listed Baltic Exchange, damaged by the IRA in 1992. But the new building, commissioned by a reinsurance company, won the Stirling prize in 2004, for the greatest contribution to British architecture. Unanimously approving judges said it was ""already a popular icon"". When wrangles occur over dramatic changes to the capital's skyline, the Gherkin is invariably invoked as proof that, when in doubt, shiny architectural outrageousness should trump the case for heritage and the popular aversion for more tall buildings. Only someone as idiotic as Prince Charles, you gather, would dispute that the Gherkin and its far taller successors are spectacularly appropriate emblems for a dynamic, forward-looking nation in no more need of planning regulations than it is of Viagra. It appears, however, that Prince Charles may have found a new ally. Ken Shuttleworth has just declared that ""the age of bling is over"". Si monumentum requiris, don't look at Ken's Gherkin. He wants architects to abandon ""crazy shapes, silly profiles and double curves"". If he were designing it again, he says, the Gherkin would look ""different"", with less glass. Interviewed by Emily Wright for Building magazine, Shuttleworth said the market should focus instead on ""beautiful, simple, rectangular forms"", eg not forms like gonads – the current mayor of London's term for Shuttleworth's sloping, all-glass City Hall. The architect has discovered the modest, the plain, the energy-saving corrective to showy, all-glass buildings. ""Companies no longer want to be seen spending that type of money on their HQ building as it doesn't look good,"" he said. ""Buildings need to reflect the time they are in."" This is the world of architecture, of course; a layperson cannot be sure Shuttleworth was not just saying it to cause one of his trademark controversies or, indeed, to prepare the way for his new, lower-rise, solid-walled development at Broadgate, an HQ for the investment bank UBS that is attractively described as ""an engine of finance"". But still, for Shuttleworth, that acknowledged master of architectural bling, to cancel the legacy of his own past is surely, when you try to conceive of an equivalent style reversal, up there with Katie Price denouncing pink. Except that a multitude of disappointed little girls leaves less impression on the landscape than the capital's still-advancing army of giant dicks, the emissaries, as Shuttleworth reminds us, of a time they are no longer in. Just last week work resumed on the ludicrous Pinnacle (or ""Helter-Skelter""), approved in 2005 and still a ""unique product"", according to its rescuers, a consortium of investors intent on bringing us the tallest skyscraper in the city. Meanwhile, in another case of retro, early 21st-century exhibitionism, the growing Shard, designed to be the highest building in Europe, persists in its incredible deformation of the London skyline. Asked for his opinion of Renzo Piano's spiked tower/obelisk, his fellow icon-maker, Shuttleworth said: ""I just don't get it. I don't understand it."" A principal objection appears to be its costly glassiness. ""I was there the other day,"" Shuttleworth said, ""and I can't see how they are going to make it work environmentally."" But that is missing the point. The point of the Shard is showing off, not sustainability. Timed, inevitably, for Olympics readiness, this tall object is due to light up, and have rings or something coming off it, to show the world how mighty we are once we've called in an Italian architect and Middle Eastern finance. Once construction had begun, thanks to John Prescott, in his then role of taste-arbiter for the nation, Boris Johnson hailed the building as follows: ""If you want a symbol of how London is powering its way out of the global recession, the Shard is it, rising confidently up to the heavens."" Does anyone, with the possible exception of bankers, want a symbol of how London is ""powering its way out of the global recession""? As is now customary, with the mayor in charge of London's aesthetics, I don't believe we were ever asked. But if, as Londoners, we'd said oh yes please, would we have chosen this import from the Dubai school of economic symbolism, erected in a place where it overturned, at a stroke of Prescott's pen, planning principles that protected the inner London skyline from speculators for half a century? Already, viewed from what was supposed to be, even when Prescott destroyed it, a protected – even iconic – view from Hampstead Heath in north London, the Shard, ""rising confidently up to the heavens"", has, as predicted by all its opponents, reduced Christopher Wren's elderly competitor to an earthbound, fussy-looking nuisance. The Shard, for God's sake. Like professional entertainers – give it up for the Gherkin! The Cheesegrater! The Helter-Skelter! The latest piece of speculative crap funded by the well-loved Qatari royal family! – new towers now arrive with ready-made nicknames, possibly to preclude the invention of ruder ones, probably to advertise, in advance, their guaranteed iconic status. Anyway. In the happy time when the fate of this particular building was still uncertain, with English Heritage describing it as a ""spike through the heart of historic London"", and most of the public saying they were against very tall buildings, its supporters deftly aligned critics with the Prince Charles school of Toytown philistinism. Concerns about views were dismissed as ignorant nimbyism. ""Only if you live in Hampstead Garden Suburb, darling,"" mocked one passionate Shardist, as if the thing were a shrine to low-cost housing, not greed. Whatever architects may say about Charles's interference, his fondness for pastiche has surely been a boon for skyline trashers everywhere, allowing their critics to be stigmatised, instantly, as thick Poundburyites whose very objections to new architecture only confirmed the geriatric worthlessness of their opinions. Conversely, the transformation of the capital into a developers' playground could be portrayed by someone such as Ken Livingstone as clever and modern. That he pledged, in the absence of any skyscraping mandate, ""to promote the development of tall buildings"" is worth remembering, now he's up for re-election. Even now, critics of Piano's spike are apt to dilute their heresy with some judiciously expressed devotion, to the effect that his wonderful Shard would be simply marvellous if only it were somewhere else. Unless, that is, the heretic happens also to be an architect, such as Ken Shuttleworth. You can't say carbuncle: you can say silly, crazy and bling. As moments go, this feels positively iconic.",Will no one halt the vandalising of London's skyline? | Catherine Bennett,2011-07-02T23:06:37Z,Catherine Bennett,uk
"It was said of the guestlist for Truman Capote's Black and White Ball that the host made 500 friends and 15,000 enemies. Legend has it that those most wounded at their non-inclusion fled New York, claiming business overseas – but, in actual fact, to escape the shame of missing the social event of the century. I adore the story, but with that mixture of total fascination and total incomprehension that forms the bedrock of my interest in showbusiness. I have never angled for an invitation, nor been remotely upset to be NFI to any event. Being ""forced"" to spend the night at home instead, eating crisps and shouting at the telly? Chalk up another victory. And yet, and yet ... in the name of all I hold sacred, is there anyone who can somehow get me an entree to the marriage of Miss Heidi Withers to Mr Freddie Bourne? By now you may be aware of Carolyn Bourne, whose emailed attempt to teach her future daughter-in-law a lesson in manners has gone viral. Heidi, whose sins included sleeping in and helping herself to more food when a guest at Mrs Bourne's house, has yet to break her silence. But we have heard from the father of the bride, who declares Mrs Bourne ""so far up her own backside she really doesn't know whether to speak or fart"". The upshot is clear: I simply cannot miss those wedding speeches. Please do just take a moment to imagine them, and you'll see why the event has instantly eclipsed the nuptials of Kates Moss and Middleton – to say nothing of the Princess Bride tribute act going on in Monte Carlo this weekend – as the hottest ticket of the season. In the meantime, let us address Mrs Bourne's 95 theses of guesthood. John Mortimer divided the world into cavaliers and roundheads, but it could be just as cleanly split into people who agree with Mrs Bourne, and people who back Heidi. Alas, it gives me negative pleasure to admit that something – nurture? Bitterness? Beaten-ness? – has me siding with Mrs Bourne. It's not that I love how her job is ""breeding pinks and dianthus flowers"", nor that she appears to be a fictional construct spewed out by the Random Daily Mail Character Generator. It's that I have spent most of my life adhering to her wretched rules of guesting – rising at dawn so as not to breach some nonexistent breakfast code, packing Mars bars so as not to faint from hunger, and generally coming to the conclusion that the only reason to spend so much as a night under someone else's roof is for the pleasure of returning home. Furthermore, like the parents who have suffered horrific times at boarding school yet regard it as the most natural thing on earth to inflict the same character-building misery upon their children, I see no reason why everyone else shouldn't live this ludicrous existence too. They don't, of course, as I well know – being married to someone disposed to doing as he pleases no matter how excruciatingly in contravention of social niceties he may be. When visiting the houses of friends' parents he will think precisely nothing of locating their TV, drawing the curtains of the room it is in (even if they are in it), and holing up to watch sport all afternoon. I recall one Boxing Day lunch with some septuagenarians – I mention their age merely as shorthand for the more mannerly attitudes of a bygone age – when, having announced he would be skipping lunch to watch the football, he returned just as we'd started eating. He urgently required their Sky password so he could buy the game on pay-per-view. Oh dear, they floundered, after a slightly dazed pause, they weren't sure they'd know where it would be, not having the remotest clue how to work the blasted box and so on, only having bought it for the cricket and not really being up on … ""Would you mind having a quick look?"" he cut in, smiling brightly, ""only kick-off's in five minutes."" The hostess eventually returned to a cold plate 20 minutes later. Chelsea beat Villa 1-0. Yet in the words of Kevin from The Wonder Years: I learned a lot that day. And not just that the greatest superpower, and one I will never possess, is the inability to feel shame. You see, not only did I actually want to watch Chelsea power their relentless and uninspiring way to a one-goal victory, I was far too repressed to say so. I'm not sure which is the least flattering of these two distinctly unflattering personality traits, but I think we can agree neither is anything to burnish the CV. So I must confess the most wistful admiration for Heidi, whose ability to sleep till mid-morning in someone else's house makes her, in my book, freer than the freest of spirits at Woodstock. But some drilled-in madness means I must confess it through the pursed lips of her ghastly old future ma-in-law, too pointlessly defeated to realise that half a morning not having to tend to guests is bliss indeed, and that the best way to ensure it keeps happening is to mash a sleeping pill into dinner that night. I can only hope that this – which comes from a place of love, as well as one of rancorous self-loathing – is enough to secure me an invitation to the undisputed wedding of the year.","Forget Moss and Middleton, Withers-Bourne is the wedding to be at | Marina Hyde",2011-07-01T19:30:02Z,Marina Hyde,uk

And Cleggsy said it was child benefit, didn't we remember his warning, and Govey said rubbish, they will have forgotten, science tells us the smaller female brain is incapable of sustained analysis, that's why we only have a fashion week, not a year. And Oik said the smaller female brain cannot handle abstract thoughts such as retirement ages, and Lansley said women were good as gold before hormone replacement, but the new HRT postcode lottery should sort it.

"How do you solve a problem like Beyoncé? She is the personification of the equality conundrum. On the one hand she was the first woman to headline Glastonbury, and this is a hugely big deal, since without that – and a bit of Florence and the Machine before – the overwhelming impression remains that only men truly know how to boogie. But what does she do with her new supremacy, her crowning achievement for all womankind? She sings a song about how, if you wanted to go out with her, moron, you should have pursued that desire with a proposal of marriage. ""Put a ring on it,"" she sings, waving her hands about like an Andrews Sister on amphetamines. ""Put a ring on it"", mouth the girls in the audience, dead-eyed with the madness of crowds. As if the past 50 years had never happened, as if one's own sexual destiny were a meaningless bauble, to be hung off the first john with a bank account who shows an interest. It's distressing. And yet would you prefer it to have been Coldplay again? The same dilemma plays itself out, from the New York Times to the IMF. That's not quite fair in the case of Jill Abramson, that paper's first woman editor, who has never shown herself to be anything other than a right-thinking feminist. Christine Lagarde, on the other hand, is very much the Beyoncé of international finance. She is problematic for these reasons: first, she is not above touting about all the ancient stereotypes of femininity, which egregious tropes are what keep women out of high office in the first place. She talks about her ""feminine and understated"" negotiating style, and how helpful it is, though frankly, her immediate stance on Greece – belt up and get on with it – won't strike protesting Greeks as at all understated, I shouldn't think. Lagarde said in an interview that the fragile foundations of the euro were down to its ""founding fathers … Founding fathers not mothers, notice. Regrettably there was no woman at the table at the time"". She is often to be heard bemoaning, in a cheerful way, the excess of testosterone in the room; she lightheartedly told Jon Stewart on the Daily Show that men were responsible for the financial crash because of their manly behaviour. The delivery and extremity of these statements does cover quite a spectrum – sometimes she seems sincere, other times she's clearly mainly joking – but still, I am not a big fan of the subtext, a worldview that holds one sex to be inherently more sensible than the other, whoever's favour it comes down on. No purpose or truth is served by these generalisations. Oh, and then there's her politics: a favourite of Nicolas Sarkozy, she is avowedly neoliberal, overseeing $15bn in tax cuts and chipping away at the 35-hour working week (the French used to call her the ""American minister""). Anything that damages social equality generally, whether increasing the wealth gap or cutting back on the welfare state or job security, will affect women disproportionately: this has been shown time and again. Lagarde may as well be doing Beyoncé's naked finger dance for all the good she does for womankind. Prominent women do not necessarily pursue the rights of women generally, and it is almost worse when they pretend to (Lagarde said once: ""I feel accountable to the community of women. And I don't want to fail because of them."") than when they don't – compare her with Margaret Thatcher. Yet the evidence is that while the high-profile letdowns stick in our minds, much important work goes unremarked: women in high office, politically, often form cross-party alliances to tackle specific women's issues that leftwing, male-dominated regimes have ignored. And centre-right or even rightwing parties will often adopt traditionally leftist policies which, in parliaments without many female representatives, people don't even talk about, let alone recognise as political currency. Angela Merkel is not a bad example, having introduced publicly funded childcare and policies to reduce violence against women. The civil architecture of gender equality – our Equality and Human Rights Commission; in Europe, the European Women's Lobby; in the UN, the Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women – comes from pressure within the ranks of power, not from protesting voices of outsiders. So even while one might, as a voice of protest, have much purer political goals and more consistent feminist messages, there is also a lot to be said for the more establishment business of muddling towards equality while possibly prioritising other, unfeminist aims at the same time. Moreover, it is axiomatic in the equality business that women should have the freedom to be as politically varied as men, as idiotic and selfish as men if they must; Theresa May has to be allowed to happen in order for Lisa Nandy to flourish. Rejoicing in female representation only when it chimes with your view is not, frankly, very feminist. Even though we are in this ironic situation where a male alleged rapist, being a socialist, would probably have pursued more female-friendly policies than a neoliberal woman, that does not mean we should regret her ascent to the top job. And as for Beyoncé, for God's sake, woman.

"Help me, I'm confused. Was Levi Bellfield standing alone in the dock last week, charged with the murder of 13-year-old Milly Dowler, or were the Dowler family, parents Sally and Bob, and sister Gemma, squashed in there with him? Dad's bondage porn stash and Mum's alleged ""favouring of Gemma"", both of which – and more – ended up cited as possible reasons for Milly not being murdered by Bellfield, but having run away instead. Sickeningly, even Milly's angst-ridden ""I hate my nose""/""No one fancies me"" age-appropriate outpourings in her diary were aired in support of Bellfield, making one wonder: is this the first case of ""teenage"" itself being subpoenaed as a witness for the defence? With respect, I don't agree with Milly's family about bringing back the death penalty; or that the basic human rights of even the likes of Bellfield should be taken away. Then again, I haven't had a loved one murdered and my life pitilessly shredded for nine years ... and counting. The Dowlers' howl of rage and pain on the court steps was perfectly justified. Surely more so than the bizarre lines of attack they suffered in court, presumably fashioned to represent a defence – any defence, however ludicrous – so that Bellfield could appeal at a later date. Indeed, while everybody is concentrating on the viciousness of the questions directed at the Dowlers, we are perhaps missing the surreal levels of irrelevance and stupidity. How did one man's bondage stash ever get to feature in another man's murder trial? Was this the first ever instance of porn-by-osmosis? Moreover, how was Milly's ""dark side"", or, more specifically, bog standard teen angst, introduced as a crucial factor? A 13-year-old girl concerned with peer pressure and her looks, wondering if it would have been better if she'd never been born – this isn't court evidence, it's an old episode of Grange Hill. One of those ""issue"" storylines, usually solved by one of the gang giving the forlorn lamenting teen a big hug. Indeed, this is precisely the sort of tragic inner monologue that only becomes poignant and amplified when people have committed suicide. Which makes dragging it into a murder case all the more offensive and nonsensical. Milly Dowler did not take her own life, she had her life taken from her, so it's really not an issue how she was feeling. Happy as Larry, miserable as sin, she was still going to get murdered. It's not as if men like Bellfield are prone to psychoanalysing their victims: ""Are you consumed enough with teenage angst for me to kill you – I wouldn't want to murder a 13-year-old who was happy with her nose?"" There is supposed to be an investigation into what happened in that court, and people are calling for change. However, it's my understanding that it is already the case that barristers are not allowed to ask any question they want, and must always justify their line of scrutiny as relevant. Therefore, what we may actually need is for everybody in court to pay proper respect to the rules and guidelines that already exist. As for Milly's ""state of mind"", just like all other murder victims, it's up there in terms of total irrelevance with the suicidal thoughts or mild depression of the 9/11 victims the day before the planes crashed. It had no real place in that courtroom. How wretched that her bouts of teen misery could be used against her in this cynical, absurd, fashion; shocking that entries in her own diary should end up getting aired in court, in an attempt to get her own murderer off the hook. Women do have gaydar. Straight up A study from the University of Torontocorrect claims that women really do have ""gaydar"" – and that we use it to sort out homosexual men from potential heterosexual mates, with the ultimate aim of procreating. Hear that, people. Gaydar is not a skill women pretend to possess when we're drunk in bars, randomly finger-jabbing at strangers with one hand, while holding glittery sandals and a bottle of Malibu in the other – it's a cold hard scientific fact/claim/thingie. That's how official it is. Apparently 40 women were asked to look at 80 men's faces, some gay, some straight, with the same expression, and no ""visual clues"" allowed (I very much hope this isn't implying anything about gay men being partial to Kylie T-shirts). Not only did women score well, they scored even better when they were ovulating, which, translated to straight man language, means hormonally ""up for it"". There's more: when women were given ""romantic stories"" to read before looking at the photographs, their gaydar became even more enhanced. I'm sorry but they're going to have to be more specific about these ""romantic stories"". One too many dodgy Mills & Boons, with open-shirted, wild-haired Fabio-types on the cover, and I think I'd be wishing every man was gay too. This is thrilling news for women everywhere – usually evolution takes bazillions of years to achieve even the tiniest biological redesign, and yet this gaydar thing has happened barely a decade after the first episode of Will and Grace. However, there is one major omission from the Toronto study, and that's whether men have any kind of gaydar for the opposite sex (les-dar?). After all, men need to guess a woman's sexual orientation. Or is it the presumption that they don't much care? Naomi, you were right to take a bite at Cadbury I'm astonished that the Advertising Standards Authority did not uphold Naomi Campbell's complaint about the Cadbury's advert for the Diva chocolate bar (""Move over, Naomi, there's a new diva in town""). In fairness, Cadbury's has already withdrawn the ad – but not racist? Really? I would say it was racist, in a blundering Love Thy Neighbour kind of way. How else could you describe a black model being rendered synonymous with a chocolate bar? Were no white ""divas"" available that day? Anyway, if Campbell's temper is the point, surely a mobile phone advert would make more sense, seeing as she's always supposed to be tossing them at staff. Chocolate bars? Nah, Naomi hasn't thrown them around so much. In my opinion, Campbell's complaint was sound. Elsewhere the accusations of racism against Chris Evans appear to have subsided, and quite right, too. Blurting ""I can barely see you"" as the The One Show's studio lights bizarrely faded, isn't ""racist"", just because a black woman happens to be sitting on the interview couch.

"Not unreasonably, I thought the tale of Aung San Suu Kyi's love for Dave Lee Travis could get no more sublime. Interviewed this week ahead of her Reith lectures, the Burmese democracy campaigner revealed the DJ's since axed World Service show had been a highlight of her years under house arrest. This, to make the obvious facetious joke, really brings the horror of the experience home. I do hope you didn't miss the Hairy Cornflake being invited on to the Today programme to discuss the revelation, as DLT somehow managed to reduce the entire pro-democracy struggle to a mere plank of a far more important argument: namely, a decade-old BBC staffing decision with which he disagreed. In doing so he crystallised perfectly the mindset of a particular type of cast-off BBC personality. It was just as possible to imagine the moan seeping from Noel Edmonds, or Simon Bates, or even Gentleman Jim Davidson – and of course from their fictional analogue, Alan Partridge. Theirs is the tragedy of misunderstood genius – indeed, one wishes the true poet of their number, Mike Read, could write one of his long-running musicals about such butterflies being broken on the wheel. Meanwhile these blasts from the past remind one what a very blasted place that past was. I have no truck with the youth of today, who think the likes of former BBC 6Music DJ George Lamb are the worst thing ever. Certainly, Lamb is an irritant, albeit one now banished to the spittle-flecked Valhalla that is TalkSport – and in today's radio firmament he may appear to be an irritant of a rare order. But these kids don't know they're born. They simply have no idea what it is like to turn on the radio and, with about three exceptions, actually want to do serious physical harm to whichever DJ is on air, as it was for years when I were a lad. John Peel understood. It was Peel who, along with Kid Jensen and Paul Burnett, planned to ambush and attack Simon Bates in the BBC car park – a plan on which he sadly never delivered. Bates is still out there, apparently breakfasting on Smooth Radio, and doubtless furious at the coverage Suu Kyi's endorsement has lavished on his erstwhile rival. So please, don't retort that you think Jo Whiley's annoying and Chris Moyles an overrated boor. I will not for one second accept it is possible to feel the same levels of visceral hatred for either as you could for Bates, or DLT, or any of the other fallen masters of the Radio 1 universe. Yet oddly, having said all this, here begins another love letter to the BBC. As mentioned, it seemed as if the tale couldn't get more sublime. But then it did, with news that the government had done a sudden U-turn on World Service funding, allocating an extra £2.2m to shore up the Arabic service that has played a significant information role in recent and ongoing uprisings. That this should happen the very day after DLT's exhumation by the heroic Suu Kyi is curious timing. Can it really be that the Hairy Cornflake has in some small part – and obviously entirely by accident – contributed something of worth to human civilisation? DLT will doubtless be peeved that official Foreign Office briefing fails to acknowledge his role in the Arab spring. More troubling, however, is the fate of the Foreign Office website worker who headlined the news ""massive U-turn on BBC World Service Funding"", before someone noticed and it was yanked. That the employee is now facing disciplinary procedures for stating the truth is a neat irony – and a reminder that the World Service's impartiality is better preserved by the BBC than the Foreign Office. But quality relies on adequate funding – and the coalition's penny-pinching in this area is at best the most parochial failure of imagination, and at worst, an entirely political attempt to destroy the product. On travels remote and otherwise over the years, I've lost count of the foreigners who have expressed admiration for the BBC, and I've always felt a mixture of totally unearned pride and amazement that something so many at home take for granted, or idiotically resent, has such an impact on the wider world. People are always banging on about how Britain doesn't make anything anymore, but the BBC is in many ways its greatest export – on a good day, it's even better than the arms we sell to Colonel Gaddafi – and certainly the country's last great institution, given the floundering NHS. This is what makes successive governments' attempts to kneecap it so screamingly depressing, with the cost of not cutting the World Service absolute peanuts set in a context that would include the £260m we've spent on Libya thus far. There is only so much more chipping away they can do before it is effectively destroyed. So next week, as the culture secretary Jeremy Hunt inevitably approves Rupert Murdoch's expansionist takeover of BSkyB, do just imagine a world in which people had to rely on big-hearted Rupe and the famously infallible market to provide a service a hundredth as good that offered by the World Service – even without the Hairy Cornflake enlivening its schedules.","Dave Lee Travis, unlikely hero of global democracy | Marina Hyde",2011-06-24T21:15:01Z,Marina Hyde,world
"Very shortly now, most of the population – except the class warriors of the Tory party – will take to the streets to demand the overthrow of capitalism. It won't take long. Overnight, the dignity of labour will be restored, and jobs created. Wealth will be understood to be about more than just money, communities will bond, and the world will live as one. This is a lovely fantasy ruined by the perpetual failure of the bloomin' working class to head up this revolutionary vanguard. But, comrades, it is even worse than that. Many of ""them"" don't even bother voting Labour. Can you imagine that? I can, actually, as I grew up in a Tory-voting working-class household and can easily rattle off the explanations for their bad behaviour: the evil manifestations of the rightwing media, consumerism, false consciousness. Or I could say, why should people vote for a party that increasingly does not look like them or speak like them, when they can vote for people who just seem to be in charge anyway? Finally, though, Labour is on the case. The policy vacuum is trying to suck in some ideas. Historically, oppositions may take more than five years to get in gear, but the fallout from the crash is so severe that there is a kind of desperation around at the moment. Simply hoping that growth doesn't happen, in order to prove the coalition wrong, does not constitute an opposition. Like many, I long ago lost faith with the Labour party – and indeed the bubble in which much ""leftwing debate"" takes place. Nonetheless, the old question, ""What is the Labour party for?"" has to be answered yet again if it is to continue. When I worked at Marxism Today in the late 80s, ""the project"" evolved from an analysis of Thatcherism that understood the ""aspirational"" voter. The fruition of this was the coalition of different classes that brought in Blair. Recognising that Labour could never have been elected by appealing only to its traditional vote was key, but now something else has gone wrong. In securing the middle-class vote since 1997, nearly five million of its voters, mainly working-class, have drifted away. If the party is to survive, Labour, now more managerial and bourgeois than ever, needs to find a way to win back what it used to consider its ""natural"" base. How can it resuscitate the values that brought the Labour party into being, and appeal to ""ordinary people""? One way, I suppose, might be not to sneer at such people. The party's tortuous jargon – ""direction of travel"" etc – gets it nowhere. Some of this will be knocked out in this weekend's Labour policy review. It will be interesting to see how much influence the Blue Labour strand of thinking has had. Ed Miliband is said to be impressed by this small group, which includes James Purnell and Jon Cruddas. While I don't share much of their thinking, I do at least think they are moving Labour out of denial about how bad things really are. In trying to claim back the word blue from all its nasty Tory connotations, we are told to think of Miles Davis or Picasso. Or how about just the blues itself? I woke up this morning and my core vote had gone? The prime mover behind Blue Labour, Maurice Glasman, now in the Lords, is right to say it is not enough for the party to appeal to those former Labour voters who went to the Liberal Democrats – it has to go further, but it cannot do so without what Glasman calls ""a plausible ideology"". Of the party itself, he says, ""It had no narrative of the past 13 years that could explain its lacks of transformative power."" Renewal, he argues, will come from a seeming paradox. The party must be ""radical and conservative"". Conservative in the sense of conserving what is good, whether it be forests or families. It starts, therefore, from a set of values rooted in relationships. This is part of an attempt to reach out to those who left Labour for the Tories. These are the people who probably read papers you don't like. But Blue Labour is saying to them, it's OK to want a sense of belonging, of decency, of stability, of not being blown around by the gusts of globalisation. Rebutting the New Labour obsession with change, cosmopolitanism and individualism, it looks to a pre-1945 tradition of guilds and co-ops. It talks of family and community and seeks to identify itself with those who feel disoriented and insecure. This is code for talking about crime and immigration. It talks up tradition, not modernity. This refiguring of terrain is an electoral strategy that may repel the left of the party, but what else is on offer right now? Not the smashing of a system, even though that system has been shown to be so fundamentally flawed. Much of what Glasman preaches strikes me as more conservative than radical, especially in relation to women. I fail to see how we need more socially conservative policies at a time when women, particularly single parents, are bearing the brunt of these cuts. Part of Labour's ""tradition"" surely includes embracing women's rights. All the talk of reciprocity, mutuality, solidarity and civic culture could easily be Red Toryism or ""big society"" waffle. Except for one thing: the talk of limiting the market and the commodification of human beings. The big society discourse is, in contrast, utterly silent on the market. Whether any of this will translate into vote-winning policies is debatable, but it is a move out of inertia. Yes, it is mired in nostalgia for the radical conservatism of William Morris or Ruskin, but other parts of the left are currently wallowing in daft strike nostalgia, so denial takes different forms. The public sector has still to take the public with it, though it is heresy to say that. The calculation may well be that the coalition does not need public sector votes anyway. This is the context in which Miliband will seek to reconnect with the so-called conservative working class. Is this anything other than another great moving-right show? Let's see. It is at least a realisation that the third party does not have years to tell us how it is different from the governing parties. The crash seems to have produced not a desire to limit the market, but to limit our vision. And a desire for familiarity. What is meant to be a paradigm shift is an attempt to make Labour electable. It is pragmatic, not revolutionary. This aim is merely to soften the blows of capitalism with an almost spiritual faith in ""relationships"". It is, as Cruddas told me, an attempt to start a conversation. Some see Miliband tacking to the left, but I don't agree. In reality, his seeking to change ""the common sense of the age"" is a form of cultural politics. Genuinely new and radical politics may well spring up from places we don't yet know, but what we are seeing is the return of what was repressed under New Labour: we are once more talking about class and ideology. Labour needs the working classes again as much as it needs to rewrite its own ideology to attract them. That alone makes me feel kind of blue.",I suspect Blue Labour is just another great moving-right show | Suzanne Moore,2011-06-24T19:00:00Z,Suzanne Moore,politics
"What would you do this morning if you were a Greek? Would you agree to your government cutting public sector jobs, pay and pensions, and increasing taxes? Or would you do what thousands of Greeks are doing and take to the streets, calling the bluff of Germans and French and making them dig deeper into their pockets? I would not hesitate. I would take to the streets. Britain may not have that option, but Greece does. Eurozone bankers have been lending the Greeks loads of money for years, knowing they could not repay and assuming Europe's taxpayers would come to the rescue. The rescue is now costing $155bn and rising. This is not to save Greece's economy but merely to service the loans it already has. Why should Greeks accept the anguish of austerity when they know their extravagance will be financed from across Hamlet's ""bourn from which no traveller returns"", from foreign taxpayers beyond the grave? Closer European union, so called, was a bad idea for precisely the reason now seen on the streets of Athens. It was an attempt by a supranational economic authority to supersede national democracy. Bluntly, it assumed the commercial culture of ""greater Germany"" could be imposed on a wide variety of cultures by virtue of geographical propinquity. Countries with a high propensity to work and save would discipline those with a lower one. Banks would finance it all. It was fantasy born of utopia, the perfect precondition for a sovereign credit bubble. Greece is to a united Europe what Northern Ireland is to the United Kingdom. It forms just 2% of the European economy – having been admitted in the latter's most imperial earlier phase in 1981 and richly subsidised ever since. Greek politics has adjusted to half of all workers being reliant on the state. Eight hundred thousand civil servants have their jobs protected by the constitution. Prevented by euro membership from devaluing its currency, Greece has found the cost of financing its budget deficit way beyond its capacity. But this is no problem as Europe continues its subsidies and stands behind its loans. In particular, Germany always pays. Now Germany is fed up – but it is fed up with the inevitable consequence of its own unionism. The EU admitted Greece when it was just seven years from corrupt military dictatorship; 30 years since, it still produces governments addicted to external support. There is no way Greece can sustain an overnight shift to Germanic efficiency, with an overvalued currency, slashed wages and hundreds of thousands thrown out of work. The parallel with Weimar Germany is too uncomfortable. Sometimes political theory meshes with practice to serve a nasty message. If you invent a federation that requires nations to converge their economies, you must accept what happens when convergence fails. The Greeks were openly encouraged to believe that EU taxpayers would ease them painlessly into a modern economy, a foolish, implausible and now dangerous prospectus. Eurosceptics said so at the time. Europe's paymasters can huff and puff, just as Greece's politicians can pledge and promise, but come the July meeting of the eurozone financiers, they will do what the politics of the moment demands, which is to keep the money flowing down Europe's arteries into Greece's bank balances. Europe will pay and Greece will again be off the hook. There may be some ""debt reordering"" but the banks have already insisted they will help only in a ""purely voluntary"" role in this. As during the credit crunch they expect their risk-taking to be underpinned by Europe's taxpayers. The banks will play their old trump card, promising a ""global credit meltdown"" if Greece is not helped to finance its debts. Any hysteria will do to avoid them losing money. The Greek predicament is a system failure. Democracy works only where accountability bites, where taxing and spending within a given timeframe are related to voting for party representatives. It arose in Greek city states, where people knew and could discipline each other in the arts of war and peace. It is thus within Britain's ""united kingdom"". No one talks about a Northern Irish budgetary crisis because that budget is subsumed under a general consensus. However economically rotten parts of the UK may be, London always pays. European union requires richer nations to subsidise poorer ones. This includes Britain because, whatever David Cameron says, it signed up to ""ever closer union"" with Greece. These cross-subsidies, especially those supporting sovereign debts in Greece, Portugal and Ireland, enjoy no democratic accountability. They are the creation of banks and browbeaten ministers at late-night meetings. The ministers are the Fifa of high finance, an oligarchy in thrall to lobbies and special interests, floating on national subscriptions. I assumed that one day Germany would get fed up with having its 20th-century war guilt exploited by a spendthrift Europe. But that day is not today. German and other banks need Europe's taxpayers to bail out their Greek and other loans. Debt must be indulged and subsidised again, whatever the political spin that covers it. Everyone seems to agree that what should happen will not happen – that is a shrinking of the eurozone, a devaluation of Europe's peripheral ""currencies"" and a corresponding cut in their indebtedness. Germany and France, the joint custodians of ""Europe"", are not ready for such a step. A union is a potent thing. It usually takes a war to break one up, and Europe is not at war. The EU has become so constitutionally flawed that few of its states dare put continued membership to referendum. The lesson is clear. Sovereign states with distinct political cultures should never surrender control over internal affairs to foreign agencies unless their people are amenable to such a loss of autonomy. Greeks eagerly joined the EU and the euro because they thought there was money in it. They were absolutely right. Why should anyone reject 30 years of such gift horses when others are paying? European union was a commendable bid to rectify the failings of the past. But it is now something quite different, a bid to dump the failings of the present on the heads of the future. As a result one cynical motto should be hung round the neck of every EU institution: don't worry, the children will pay.

"It appears that Little Britain creators, David Walliams and Matt Lucas, are ending their partnership. Permanently, temporarily – who knows or cares? If this is the end of an era, good riddance. People slag off Frankie Boyle, quite rightly sometimes (gags about Down's syndrome kids, how depressing). However, at least with him, one gets the impression that there's a conscience rattling around in there, the sense of someone on a true comedy kamikaze mission, always primed to go down in flames. By contrast, when Walliams and Lucas hit the big time, they exuded the frantic, scrabbling aura of also-rans who'd been hacking away in the shadows of TV and radio for years. Indeed, basking in the postcoital glow of their longed-for fame, they'd say things such as: ""There were times when we wondered if it would ever happen for us."" Maybe this delay (bringing with it desperation and lack of confidence?) explains why they lunged so frantically for the lowest common denominator and refused to let go. Perhaps this gives context to the endless spew of chav jokes, mental illness jokes and fat jokes, with Lucas, by far the more talented of the duo, clinging to ""fat is funny"" as if the only thing he had going for him was his high BMI. Elsewhere, there was the gormless teen mum Vicky Pollard; that creepy care-in-the-community skit, with Andy Pipkin, the guy in the wheelchair. And then there were dragged-up ""women"" so hideous they made Hinge and Bracket resemble glamour models. The relative charm of Daffyd, ""the only gay in the village"", just wasn't enough to save what was one of the most sneering, cold-hearted, nasty little shows ever seen on British TV. Rewarding middle-class, educated, comedy workaholics for lampooning people without any of their advantages, struggling on the margins of society – was this where we'd come to, a boorish festival of exploitation and contempt? Walliams once gave an interview saying something to the effect of how he found ""inspiration"" just looking around ordinary streets and seeing funny little people leading their funny little lives. Hmm. One wonders why he didn't just look around the private members' clubs he frequented, where there were plenty of ""funny little people""– specifically, vile media prats. Why didn't Walliams write ""comedy gold"" about this, an elitist sphere he knew about, rather than a world of pain he didn't? Admittedly, I've developed a real problem with the preening Mr Walliams and the way he oozes about the place like the Peter Mandelson of comedy. I reacted to the news of Walliams's laudable charity Channel swim with an inner howl of: ""NO! Does this mean I'll have to hate him less?"" Which is pathetic. Then again, how much swimming would a comedian have to do before they were cleansed of the karmic stench of having a hand in creations such as Vicky Pollard, who alone gave certain sections of the media a label for the disgust they love to express towards young girls spiralling downwards, due to poverty, illiteracy and teen pregnancy. By my calculations, that's a lot of front crawl. Little Britain had our full attention and, for the most part, all it did was escort us down to an underclass bedlam to jeer at the loonies. So spare us this pompous announcement of their split, as if something terribly important has occurred. Little Britain USA tanked and so did the unfunny Come Fly With Me. It would appear that the partnership that brought us ""yeah, but"" is going out in a blaze of indifference, which, in my opinion, is fully deserved. Be brave, Harry, and take up abseiling So Prince Harry is going to fight the Taliban as an Apache helicopter pilot. If I remember rightly, there was some sibling rivalry, aired between William and Harry, a couple of years ago. It went along the lines of: ""I wanna fly a helicopter in Afghanistan."" ""Nah, I wanna!"" I thought then as I do now: what is this – a military version of boy racer syndrome? Now here we are again. I don't want to undermine Harry's courage, which is surely as real as that of all service personnel in his position. However, this is lunacy. The mere fact of his presence will stoke enemy interest to an unprecedented degree, therefore putting everybody working alongside him at far greater risk. What bigger scalp could there be as payback for Osama bin Laden? Never mind the extortionate extra costs involved in protecting a royal – why did they have to announce it? Shouldn't the entire operation have been kept secret, only made public on his safe return? That way, Harry wouldn't have painted a giant dartboard on his forehead or endangered his comrades. So what if a prince of the realm wants to fight for his country. Tell him he can't, because he's a security risk. Personally, I'm rather less concerned at the thought of thwarting Harry's military ambitions than I am for those compromised by his presence. Middle Eastern conflict seems dangerous enough without an action prince turning up in a helicopter. As Captain Mainwaring used to say: ""Stupid boy."" Harry should be made aware that courage is mutable. In this instance, the truly brave thing for him to have done would have been to drop the whole military idea and take up abseiling or hang-gliding – indeed, any pursuit that only puts his own neck at risk. Take That fans have nothing to be ashamed of Much has been made of the ""lairy, middle-aged"" Take That fans on tour. At the band's Manchester date, Robbie Williams observed: ""We used to have the record for girls fainting. Now it's for the most boozed-up, middle-aged women. I, Robbie Williams, am proud of you."" Nice one, Robbie, I owe you a cheeky bra-flash. As for those who look down on the rampaging ""Thatters"", how dare they? My mum was always gallivanting off to gigs in middle age: first Barry Manilow (Mani-love!) and then Will Young. Health issues mean she can't stalk either of these gentlemen as exuberantly as she used to, but I'm glad she did. When her children were very young, she never had any money and rarely went out, so she was fully entitled to embrace her inner teenybopper in later years. I'm sure many of the ""Thatters"" have similar stories – some people don't get to have a proper ""yoof"". Anyway, who passed the law saying that live music was just for the young and trendy?

"Recently I had to go and see a man about a dog. Dog is as good a word as any, as it is at least a word that we can all say. I had gone to make my ""last will and testament"" and I spent some time talking to a nice guy about what will happen to my house ""eventually"" – should something happen to me. Call me morbid, but I do think ""something"" is going to happen to me. And it won't involve a dog. I am going to die. Sooner or later. Many people have said it is entirely sensible to make a will, but indicated that I must not go on about it, as it is ""depressing"". When I got the document, as it had no mention of death, I emailed it to my grown-up kids to check it out. One said: ""Thanks. That's cheered me up LOL."" In all fairness there is very little that she does not reply LOL (Laugh Out Loud) to. Just don't let her design my gravestone. It will be along the lines: ""WTF!!! Mum you still aint up? ROFL. Soz."" This is the context in which we talk – or don't talk – about death. Legal types still use ""passing over"", which I find creepy and ghostly. Each profession has its own discourse and some medics are honest to the point of brutality. The best doctors I have encountered have been at the worst of times. Those in the hospice where my mother died made no pretence, and therefore ensured enough diamorphine for her to be unconscious. After the torture of hospital where ""palliative care"" was a theory not a practice, this was a relief. In paediatric intensive care, too, medical staff have been loving and truthful. When one of my children had meningitis, in a unit of eight, two other children died in one day. The staff gathered us together and told us how sad they were. This acknowledgment does not happen on coronary and cancer wards, where other patients wake up to an empty bed near them. Where denial sets in, then, is hard to pinpoint. Death is ordinary, and yet we still cover it up. Undertakers may be a little more eco, we may have life celebrants and some neo-pagan rituals thrown in, but it's still a business that tries to sell you the most expensive wooden box it can. The whole thing takes you back to an era in which toilet rolls were covered up with strange lacey dollies. Making preparation for one's dying, however, has now become bizarrely politicised, as the reaction to Terry Pratchett's extraordinary film, Choosing to Die, has shown. We saw Peter Smedley, who had motor neurone disease, go to Dignitas in Swtizerland, drink poison and die. Sure, he and his incredible wife were all stiff, upper-crust charm, but they were fearless, as was the film. The film gave us (and then took away) these people who felt they had no choice but to die in a strange part of Zurich. They were scared to wait until their condition got worse and they could not travel. As tears rolled down my face, I was confused as to what I was crying about. Then I was even more confused by having this issue somehow debated in left/right terms with the insinuation that the BBC is trying to make us all commit suicide. My assumption that a libertarian or even liberal mindset would be in favour of ""assisted dying"" was wrong. The right is petrified of this ""right"". The ideal remains ""slipping away"". Some do. My nana died in her sleep. My grandad's watch stopped at the exact time. Once, on a bus, the conductor asked me to nudge the woman next to me as we had reached the last stop, and indeed she had. I could not wake her. Nor could the ambulance men. So she had died next to me, by which I was embarrassed. It wasn't till someone else started boasting about seeing a dead body did I realise that I had seen one. Callow, yes. Uncomprehending, yes. Not wanting to die on a bus was my main reaction. It's a bit undignified, and all that resuscitation in public? No thanks! Now I have lived a bit more, I simply do not want to die in agony or waste away. Please don't tell me it's not like that, as experience tells me different. ""Two, four, six, eight, not the Church and not the State. Women will decide our fate,"" we used to chant at abortion rallies. I feel the same way about how I die. Yes, my ideology – and I recognise it as such, unlike some people of faith – involves a notion of autonomy. The claiming of rights over my own reproductive system, and how long this body lives, changes as medicine changes. My invoking of this as a right, more properly a choice that can be legislated for, is in no way a judgment about anyone else's quality of life. Yes it's a bit me, me, me. Rather like a birth plan, I imagine death plans probably go wrong. Having done drug-free, natural childbirth, there is no way I want a drug-free death, even though we can't all be Aldous Huxley whose last words were: ""LSD 100mg. i.m."" (intramuscularly – his wife obliged and injected him twice). But still I am mystified by the right, who argue so strongly against the nanny state, but see assisted suicide as sinful. Their job is to protect the already vulnerable, and I well understand the caution of some of the disability lobby. Yet I find this sudden concern with the elderly or the severely disabled strange at a time when they are already not being properly cared for. At all. As with abortion, the issue is: at what point does extending my right encroach on someone else's? For those against abortion, it will be the rights of the foetus. For those against assisted dying, it is more difficult to understand who is being protected. It was clear Pratchett's wife wants to care for him, and there is dignity in caring, just as there is love in setting someone free. Our fear of dying is intertwined with fear of dependency. To speak about death challenges the living. I am with Beckett: ""They give birth astride of a grave, the light gleams in an instant, then it's night once more."" But then I find Beckett ultimately life-affirming and funny (yay, Samuel Beckett LOL!). If life is about that instant, then we must live fully in the here and now. We can only imagine what a good death might be when we are still compos mentis. But to be with someone dying is to live with how it is now, and how it will be when they are gone. These are parallel universes that cannot be magically resolved. Right now I feel I want to die when I have had enough. This talk of assisted dying is another kind of avoidance, though. The reality is of assisted living. And as we speak, for many it is not good at all. We have an ageing population – with dementia increasing – and it's bloody tough. That is the future. I may at some point want to refuse that future. It is my affair, and I take comfort in this. To be pro-choice on assisted dying means simply to me to be entirely pro–life.",My death is my affair – just don't let my daughter design my headstone | Suzanne Moore,2011-06-17T20:45:01Z,Suzanne Moore,society
"For Reiss, Zara, LK Bennett, Whistles, the news just gets better. William and Kate have advertised for a dresser. Since Kate dresses in Reiss, Zara, LK Bennett etc, this means that high-street fashion is to be respected as never before. For example, Kate's £49.99 day-after-the-wedding dress, when it makes its next appearance, will surely become the first Zara garment in history to be ironed, wrapped in tissue, unwrapped, ironed, accessorised and laid out, along with the almost as frugal £129 pumps and a pair of nude tights, by a dedicated member of the royal household. The posts of valet and butler are also, according to some reports, being advertised within Buckingham Palace, after a change of heart by the prince and his wife, who earlier proposed to manage without help. ""He and Catherine will live without domestic staff and they wouldn't do it any other way,"" his secretary announced. As much as this appeared to be a laudable effort to empathise with austerity Britain, it was also a neat bit of pre-emptive propitiation, the Cambridges having said we should not expect much royalling from them for a bit. Not having a butler, dresser and housekeeper has duly turned out to be a highly effective, not very taxing way of differentiating their modern, less hierarchical sort of royalness from the unabashed petulance that is exhibited by everyone but the Queen, according to ex-servants. Prince Andrew might employ a carrier of the royal ironing board and Prince Charles a dedicated toothpaste-squeezer: the Duchess of Cambridge has been seen flourishing a supermarket trolley and buying liver for her husband's supper. So, after eight months of brilliant press, on the brink of an official outing to Canada, the couple have found the ideal moment to make adjustments that begin to bridge the gap between their own, staffless household and Prince Charles's retinue of 149, including 25 personal attendants. To date, their willingness to take on a starter pack of servants has itself been presented as something of a sacrifice: a forced surrender to the oppressive, royal life they are soon to begin in what is depicted as a beastly, previously asbestos-ridden warren of undecorated rooms in Kensington Palace. Reports stress that their flat is ""modest"" to the point that it was comfortless enough to be used by staff, has enjoyed only the barest of refurbs; is practically an uninhabitable cave, in other words, and not, in any circumstances, to be confused with the sort of luxurious, KP apartment where Princess Margaret once devoted a lifetime to hand-washing her coral collection. For the successful candidates, the new jobs are – money aside – win-win. If, as seems probable, Kate has yet to appreciate that servants are sub-human, then conditions in the new household will have to be an improvement on those described by the much denigrated ex-butler Paul Burrell, who entered palace employment as a teenager. ""The art of being a good servant,"" he wrote in A Royal Duty, ""was to perform as many of my duties as possible without being seen. A servant's life was spent in the shadows and, at best, he or she should be invisible. At its most extreme, this requirement led a scurrying army of maids or footmen to hide until the coast was clear."" At Sandringham, for example, they would hide in a cupboard under the stairs. If hiding was impossible, the routine for royal staff was to press themselves against the nearest wall, bowing as their employers passed by. As a butler working for Charles and Diana, Burrell acquired additional duties – covering up for both employers' adultery, warming the sunbed for Diana, cowering from objects thrown by Prince Charles at Highgrove. ""In a flash, he picked up a book from the table and hurled it in my direction."" The consolation, of course, was fabulous material for his memoir, an account of royal service offering far more indictable material concerning the Windsors' treatment of servants than anything they did to Diana, who could be foul to underlings herself. Nobody came close, however, to Princess Margaret, with her trick of feeling the Balmoral television for warmth, in case staff had been watching as they waited up for her, according to the tradition that has domestic servants, of all households, working far longer shifts than any factory employee. ""A servant's life was insular and restrictive, tiring and unsociable,"" wrote Burrell, sounding like a social historian of the 17th century, and he was not, remember, a maid or, worse, a valet to Prince Charles, like Ken Stronach, who watched a washbasin being wrenched off a wall. Unless William and Kate plan a more enlightened regime, preferably staffed by monoglot Poles, they should appreciate that their advertisement for staff amounts to a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for any dresser, butler or housekeeper with the energy, at the end of a 12-hour day, to keep a diary; expect the first, behind-the-scenes titles in, at most, five years' time. Injunctions, which Charles has used with great success, given his record on publicly invading his own privacy, cannot prevent a resourceful memoirist trying his or her luck in America, as Wendy Berry did with The Housekeeper's Diary. As future defender of the faith, perhaps it was understandable for Charles to fear Berry, most merciless of the servant-historians, though, after Diana's death, her protection officer, Ken Wharfe, and private secretary, Patrick Jephson, were good enough to flesh out any aspects of the marital nightmare the housekeeper had missed, concerning night-time creaking sounds (Wharfe) or Diana's self-delusion (Jephson). It cannot guarantee their future privacy, unfortunately, that the Cambridges are sure to refrain from the Wales' tantrums and cruelty, their indecent babyishness and successive affairs. After all, people pay the National Trust and watch Downton Abbey merely to enjoy the vivid contrast between upstairs and down. And if William and Kate come, like their parents and grandparents, to expect their intimacies to be routinely observed by silent, eye-averting menials bearing job titles and uniforms that would have been familiar to George III, that has got to be as interesting as Downton, though possibly, in real life, less lovable. Today, as in the creepily seigneurial DSK scandal, a word like ""chambermaid"" can sound as insulting to personal dignity as a pair of snapped fingers or shout of ""Boy"". Recent mockery of Trudi Styler's feudal affectations and of the absurd Paltrow's advertisement for a full-time classic tutor/musical virtuoso/Olympian for her children also suggest that the rules of private, domestic employment may finally be changing, in a way that may ultimately impact on the home of the new Lord High Admiral of the navy. What kind of person, nowadays, wants to think of themselves as a servant or ""in service""?

"As if conducting some perverse sociological experiment, I managed to have a child in each decade, starting in the 80s. Don't worry, I've stopped now. Chatting this week, I asked them at what age they had become ""sexualised"". My middle child said: ""Mum, when will you stop making up words?"" ""It is a word,"" said the oldest. ""There is a government report on it."" We then talked about who was going on the Slut Walk. The 10-year-old told me off about the word ""slut"", saying it was disgusting. This is the same 10-year-old who asked me what fisting was a few days ago. I may be fairly liberal, but I did not answer fully. We are all censors at heart. If I don't tell her the internet surely will. So yes, as a parent, I understand feeling powerless. Often. Of course I can block sites, but I cannot monitor what my kids see and hear all the time: the sexual ""wallpaper"" that is said to surround them. This was how the Bailey review describes the sexual imagery with which our culture is saturated. Our children are growing up too soon. They are encouraged to venture into territory that they are too emotionally immature to inhabit. These are the charges, repeated again and again, which presuppose an age of purity. I have made them myself at times. How this imagery affects us all needs to be studied. Properly. The latest report is an example of how not to do it. The Bailey review set up by this government – at what cost, I wonder – was headed by Reg Bailey, who is head of the Mothers' Union, a Christian charity. Still, it is quite novel that something that was in both the Tory and Lib Dem manifesto has been acted upon. It must really push middle-class buttons. Never mind that we had reviews by Professor David Buckingham and Dr Linda Papadopoulos only recently. And two by Professor Tanya Byron on internet safety. What does Bailey bring to the party? To be honest, little we don't already know, and zilch in terms of evidence to back up any of the claims made. And as we have come to know, there is not even a basic understanding that our view on sexuality may be culturally moulded rather than revealing some innate ""truth"". OK, so I will put away my Freud, but it is significant, as Dr Petra Boynton has said, that this is yet another report that does not include much about how young people themselves feel. Actually, my daughter is right. There is a basic problem with the word ""sexualisation"". What does it really mean? It is used now to describe a kind of societal grooming of girls – and the entire discussion is focused around girls – into a premature sex life. Our children know and see too much too soon. (Whatever happened when children did not have separate bedrooms from their parents, I wonder?) Still, left and right agree that the selling of padded bras to seven-year-olds is abhorrent. The display of naked breasts on the middle shelf thanks to Lad Mags is not nice. Don't worry – such mags are in decline anyway, and nothing in this report will challenge Page 3 or indeed the peculiar ""sexualisation"" of those poor Middleton sisters with their breasts, bottoms and legs now permanently on display as they lay back and think of England. Or Wales. Wherever. Those who like posh totty are also those who don't want to see ""raunch culture"" acted out by their own offspring. Personally, I do not want to explain Rihanna's supposed excitement over whips and chains any more than to explain why a woman who has never supported herself is now a national ""icon"". Here is where it gets a little difficult. The omnipresent sexual imagery long questioned by feminists precisely because it devalued women is now being questioned by the right, who in every other respect are pushing things back for women. The Tories are not the Taliban – of course not – but rightwingers are invariably fundamentalist in the attempt to control female sexuality. The awkward encounter between the right and feminism is premised on this daft word, sexualisation. So let's call it as it is. We are talking really about commercialisation. Bodies do not exist without sex. Is there a difference between infantile and adult sexuality? Yes. At what age can that sexuality be commodified? At what age can it consume? At what age can it be regulated? These are the real but difficult questions. And the hardest one of all, what really makes children grow up ""too soon"", may have nothing to do with sex and everything to do with poverty. Watching the incredibly revealing BBC1 documentary Poor Kids this week, to see small children scratching their eczema while talking about parental debt and how things can never change, shows us some kids do learn the facts of life way too young because of deprivation. This glimpse into gross inequality should shock us as much as porn downloaded on to mobiles in the playground. But we live with it. We cannot control what we are sold and not one of the Bailey recommendations suggests we can. The hardcore shot is this one: this government will not act to regulate the market even when the market sells additive-filled food and thongs to little children. It will instead make sensitive noises at the outer edge and the middle class will dress its children in pretty polka-dot dresses while the useless underclass will dress its little girls as tarts. Boys clothes, indeed their entire sexuality, are ignored. Generally they should not wear hoods or have their jeans hanging off their arses. Otherwise they can go hang. The Bailey report is not only ineffective practically, as no one will do anything, but it is theoretically vacuous. There is indeed a body of research that seeks to understand how visual imagery affects us, and what harm it may cause. It is often done under the cover of the much-maligned media studies. But experiments and evidence appear to count for nothing against the moral panic of concerned parents. The viewing of porn, we are told, for instance, is addictive. What model of addiction are we using here? If we want the state to intervene – ie censor more material – we need to think very carefully. I started off talking about my girls because I wonder if my youngest has been exposed to much worse stuff than my eldest. Certainly, in terms of technology she has more access to more imagery. But it seems to me that they have ""grown up"" at around the same time, though in a culture that has shifted from telling us ever more strongly that what we look like is much more important than how we think or feel. What is needed then is not some weird repression of sexuality or of young people, but of a rapacious capitalism that commodifies every desire and yes, will sell sex to children. No review that tells politicians this is what they need to regulate is ever acted on. Concerned parents, even that nice David Cameron, need to put out or shut up. Instead, they will protect their own children, knowing full well that the system they get down on their knees in front of means other people's children may get screwed. Because ""other people's children"", if no longer kept innocent, will in such a world inevitably be guilty.","Yes, our children are growing up too soon.

"Answers. We must have answers. What drives a congressman to jeopardise his career by tweeting a lewd photo? What immensely nuanced reasons cause a young, fit sportsman to take advantage of a handful of the gazillion sexual opportunities offered to him? At some clinical level, is it deliberate self-sabotage? Does the love rat believe himself unworthy of his success? Does having sex with hot cocktail waitresses mean you hate yourself? Will there ever be enough articles written in specious pop psychology in which humanities graduates affect to unravel the synaptic waveforms which might cause a public figure to be a silly billy? Questions, questions. Pondering the fantastically psychologically complex cases of sexting US congressman Anthony Weiner, and shagging Manchester United footballer Ryan Giggs, and all the Tigers and Coles and Clintons that have gone before them, it is clear that we couldn't begin to fathom what the hell's going on here without recourse to expert guidance from a Nobel neuroscience laureate. Yet at the same time, I can't help but think of a favourite scene from The Big Lebowski. Jeff Bridges has just watched a Mr Big write something on a pad before tearing off the page and leaving the room. Convinced that he may have a vital lead, the Dude scribbles a pencil across the paper to bring out the imprint of whatever was inscribed on the page before. The revelation? Just a doodle of a naked man with a huge penis. In some ways this visual gag is the movie in microcosm – a riff on film noir detective stories in which the search for a rational explanation is continually frustrated and there basically aren't any answers (other than to just go bowling). The plot of The Big Lebowski is, of course, infinitely more complex than that of any of the current crop of sex scandals. Forgive the lapse into technicalese, but could it be that Weiner et al really didn't give it much thought, and just succumbed to the temptation of a quick shag – virtual or otherwise? Such is the lunatic optimism of the aroused human – not always, but frequently enough for us not to require the smelling salts. Whether the tendency towards time-worn pratfalls is one of those notional qualities that separates us from the animals, I don't know. Perhaps an ethologist would get in touch and enlighten us as to whether an alpha male lion might ""risk it all"" by flirting with an outsider, or sparing a gazelle, or whatever would make him feel obliged to deliver a shamefaced press conference to the rest of the pride? Failing that, the Disney Corporation must explore the idea in The Lion King III: Simba's Sexting. Those people claiming Weiner was subconsciously sabotaging his career are little different from those who keep saying they feel ""lied to"" by men who have cheated on someone other than them. They ascribe motives that were never there on any meaningful level. Ooh, but it's the arrogance, they say. It's his arrogance in thinking he wouldn't get caught. Is arrogance really the right term? Surely ""temporary suspension of disbelief in the possession of an erection"" is fairer? It's less catchy, and makes it sound less of a two-fingers to you and me, but it's a more realistic explanation. My suspicion is that fairly soon after Weiner tweeted the photo of his tumescence – one doesn't like to hazard how many seconds – he was overcome by feelings of self-reproach. Disbelief would have been back from suspension, until the next time. But there's no design to it. We might coarsely refer to it as the cock-out theory of history: people doing daft things in the misplaced hope they might get away with it. To overthink Mr Weiner's failure to give his actions sufficient thought is to miss the point entirely. Bizarrely, though, love-rattery is increasingly viewed as some kind of psychiatric affliction, as opposed to a straight-up moral failure. Tiger Woods had to go to hospital for it, you'll recall (where the shrinks appear to have totally ruined his golf game, as I'm sorry to have predicted at the time). Was he unwell? I genuinely think the Daily Mail writer who this week said of Ryan Giggs, ""I can't believe this despicable rat duped me for so many years"", is unwell on a far more significant level, and urge him to get treatment. But millions seem to disagree. Adultery is becoming viewed as a crime against the rest of us, as opposed to a betrayal of the spouse. Perhaps Weiner will be back with some retroactively applied explanation about how he didn't believe himself worthy of his wife's love or whatever, and will survive to fight another day. The good news for those who like a bit of scandal is that human beings – and even that fairly closely related species, politicians – are mostly incapable of learning from others' mistakes. So it won't be long before another public figure miscalculates the cost-benefit analysis of showing the world his pants, for reasons that, after the event, will seem completely inexplicable even to himself.

"Dave loves, but maybe I went too brown in Ibiza cos Anya said ""the future's bright"" the minute I walked into the summer ball, but the weird thing is, it is. Because people are finally seeing how much Dave has learned from my luxe retail experience and even Oik grasps that it is literally insane to have Anya and Tamara and me around and not apply our knowledge of pricing intangibles, like L'Wren Scott wanting $2,300 for her small Lula bag, which is not actually unreasonable even if it does look fairly boring and clunky, because you've got to factor in stuff like the noise it makes when you open it. I mean, I said to Cleggsy, very slowly because he was really struggling with the concept, on the face of it, a high-end tree might seem fairly worthless, given it doesn't do much and you could eventually grow another, just the same? But it still has a value when you think of the divine rustling sound, plus the lifetime offer of shade, the range of classic colours in a whole variety of different greens, all the leaves that had to be specially grown, the exquisitely crafted bark, and the fact that you're looking at half the infrastructure for a hammock, if you favour the artisanal look. Of course when it finally clicked about eco-valuation Cleggsy started going outrageous, how can you put a price on beauty, next thing you'll be costing happiness – I'm like, do keep up – and now he looks so idiotic because the experts are saying the value of nature is totally awesome? Oik thinks if we only sold off robins it would pay for the whole NHS restructuring without any significant impact on worms. So Honest Phil obvs wants a piece and Tamara says whatever we're selling, she's in, this could be bigger than Jimmy Choo. But imho we wait, cos Springwatch is still talking up the robin price and there's so much stuff left to value, a small iconic songbird might be practically worthless compared with the moon, which admittedly does not serve any purpose I can think of, but everyone said the exact same thing about Prada and now that is worth $15bn.

"Cast your minds back to Tony Blair's great triumph of 2007. He appeared in a sketch for Comic Relief with Catherine Tate, who was playing the stroppy Lauren Cooper. She takes tea in to Blair and starts babbling about Center Parcs and Nike Town. Exasperated, the then prime minister came back with: ""Am I bovvered?"" What a guy! He could act? Who knew? If only Gordon Brown had been able to do a turn in Gavin & Stacey, maybe things would have been different. Anyway, part of Lauren's diatribe was actually about chavs and pikeys. Her accent is heavy patois. This is now the London accent. The fact is our ""racist"" white working class sound mostly black. I remember no great outcry about chavs then. We laughed at her and Vicky Pollard. Murmurs about Little Britain's white, privately educated men making fun of young working-class women and blacking up started to make things a bit uncomfortable. But not as uncomfortable as the average city bus ride. There are always arguments on buses, people muttering to themselves, chicken boxes thrown, gangs of kids irritating those desperately trying to read Ian McEwan. You are either on the bus or off the bus. Or, if possible, in a taxi … but on the bus I do hear the word ""chav"" often thrown around by those who would be seen this way by others. Owen Jones's new book, Chavs: The Demonization of the Working Class, is really much more about class, and is a blinding read. I like much of what he says, but don't share his faith in the Labour party. Nor the culture of offence that springs up around ""banned"" words. I say banned words because Meral Hussein-Ece got in a bit of bother after tweeting about being stuck in ""chav land"". She is a baroness and a Lib Dem, and she should know better. She was describing aggressive behaviour, and I defended her because I don't really know her as a peer or Lib Dem but as a Turkish Cypriot councillor where I live, who spent years filling in benefit forms and setting up refuges for women. Has she done a lot for working-class people? Yes. Is she now getting vile racist abuse? Yes, such as: ""We would love to see you striped (sic) of your British passport and sent back to the third world dump you came from."" Here, the end point of identity politics looms into view. I am working-class made good. (Or bad? I told the Labour boys attacking her that I didn't give a flying fuck for their sanctimony. But I am not a baroness. Any day now, surely?) Our kids went to schools not good enough for our MP, the first black woman to get into parliament. Here, at what academics call the interstices of race and class, and others would call a huge mess, a clearer understanding of the class politics that Jones calls for would indeed help. But is this uptightness about chavs really new and heartfelt? Isn't it all really simply a question of definition? Julie Burchill talked about chavs in 2005, but because she is a maverick her arguments went unheard. Michael Collins wrote The Likes of Us: A Biography of the White Working Class in 2004. He had a go at me in it, as I have described the killers of Stephen Lawrence as ""white trash"". I stand by that absolutely. In fact, one of my all-time heroes, Roseanne Barr, once described herself as America's greatest nightmare – ""white trash with money"" – and much of what Jones describes – the turning of the lower orders into subhumans – is not confined to the UK. Jeremy Kyle's moralising to dispossessed, DNA-tested losers is merely a formula where this bizarre bullying constitutes entertainment but is also the only time you see working-class people on TV. But then culture always moves faster than political discourse, and as this discourse has been about the feral, feckless workless for so long, it now works in tandem with it. The old respectable working class with their work ethic and ""community spirit"" has been hammered out of existence. The jobs they do make them identify as middle class. Those who won't take those jobs are skivers. The new low-pay, part-time jobs in the barns of call centres and retail are not unionised. The last civil war – the miners' strike – put paid to that. I can't share all the nostalgia for some of these old ways of life. The claustrophobia of ""community"" and ""family"" for some of us felt like the ""learned incuriosity"" that Lynsey Hanley talks of about life on council estates. How do we recognise class, then? And how do we redefine aspiration as something other than individual? Weirdly, the economy may force back the Tory ideology on home-owning as younger generations will never be able to buy. If home-owning is the ultimate route to belonging, we are going to have a lot of people who will never belong. We can maybe see where the right is going. David Brooks's The Social Animal has been embraced by politicians precisely because of its inherently conservative conclusions about ""character"". Brooks trots through the neuroscience and sociobiology to explain how we are governed by more than reason. As usual, all the radical implications of Freud are stripped away. Instead, we learn that what makes us achieve in life is not IQ, but impulse control. Self-restraint. Where best do we learn that? In stable middle-class families. A culture of instant gratification is learned in disorganised families. Poor people. Single mums. The usual. In other words, social policy has to start with this. Giving actual money to poor people is a stupid idea. They suffer from moral poverty. This sense of a lack of self-restraint peaked in the gendered holy trinity of chavdom – Katie Price, Kerry Katona and Jade Goody. The right fear out-of-control women. Always. If we understand anything at all about the political unconscious, then the chav phenomenon is the rampant id. I want it all here. Right here, right now. I understand the feeling, sure. When listening to James Delingpole ""arguing"" with Jones on the radio, my main thought was that if this kind of mind is what the best schools produced, the money would have been better off spent on crack and crisps. But to watch the middle class argue over whether the word chav is as derogatory as Paki or nigger is ludicrous. Chavdom is just a smash-and-grab on the ""values"" on offer. It is a response to the rich slagging off the poor for being poor. It's a sideshow. If you really want to embrace this class solidarity, go for it – and Jones is passionate about this. But I don't see a collectivity forming around this one. I have no need to embrace my inner chav. I already deep fried it. And I hate shopping. Call me a traitor to my class. The C-word is not chav but class, and another word will spring up to replace it. It always has. False empathy is just another kind of false consciousness. What values are being defended here, and by who? While we argue about which words are the right ones, we do the job of the right. The answer is to neither demonise nor celebrate aspects of working-class life, but to extend choice in every way. Culturally and politically. By any means necessary.",Debates about the word chav are irrelevant to the working-class experience | Suzanne Moore,2011-06-04T08:00:01Z,Suzanne Moore,society
"It's the season of cyber-panic. On iPlayer, you can watch Adam Curtis tying together Ayn Rand, the crash of 2008 and early 20th century botany into a warning about computers threatening civilisation. The aftershocks of Nicholas Carr's admirably impactful book The Shallows ripple on, spreading an uneasy suspicion that the internet is corroding our mental faculties. Last week Nicolas Sarkozy hosted the eG8 forum, dragging the technology industry's big players to Paris, and lecturing them with a De Gaulle-esque sweep about the inviolable supremacy of governments, and the dangers of the online realm becoming ""a parallel universe outside laws and morals"". We all know the tropes: porn, privacy, the mortal danger of Facebook for kids, and apocalyptic fears about cyber-warfare. Talking of which: on Wednesday, 24 hours after the Pentagon served notice that it would now consider any deliberate cyber-attack by a foreign state an ""act of war"" (that is, an action worthy of military retaliation), news broke of another assault on Google email accounts, allegedly launched from China. The targets reportedly included ""senior US government personnel"", whose across-the-board use of Gmail appears to make them vulnerable to this latest spurt of online mischief, based on ""phishing"" – that is, directing victims to divulge passwords via fake websites. In response, Google urged its users to spend 10 minutes ""taking steps to improve your online security so that you can experience all that the internet offers – while also protecting your data"". The American government, perhaps, might also instruct its employees to make things that bit more difficult for hackers by spreading their email accounts around a bit. That, though, is not the way our world seems to work. We seem to accept it as something as inarguable as the weather, but Google now has a terrifying dominance of the world's internet use. In Europe, it controls around 90% of the online search market. At the last count, Gmail had 193.3 million monthly users. In 2007 Google purchased DoubleClick, specialists in the technology whereby people's web habits are tracked, and ads are targeted accordingly. Google also owns YouTube, Blogger and the social networking site Orkut. When it comes to ownership of the smartphone operating system Android, things get complicated, but Google is effectively in charge, having acquired Android Inc in 2005. And so the list goes on. Google's browser Chrome now accounts for 14.5% of European web use, and is on the up. As is Google's apparent appetite for any technology business it can get its hands on: in the first 10 months of 2010 alone, it spent $1.6bn on new acquisitions. If you have ever raged against the stranglehold practised by Rupert Murdoch, bear one thing in mind: Google's power now threatens to make him look like a village newsagent. Rather than trying to put jump leads on increasingly impossible ideas about copyright enforcement, or somehow subjecting the web's endless information flows to the edicts of domestic courts, it's this issue that merits serious attention from the world's governments. Sarko et al should take note: compared to the old fear that Microsoft might monopolise access to the web via its software (the spark for its epic tussle with the US department of justice), we are talking about something of a completely different order. Google has a shot not at control of the means to access information, but the information itself. Potentially all information, which is something worth panicking about. There are glimmers of hope. In one of those turnabouts that defy satire, Microsoft is pursuing Google via the European commission, claiming that it unfairly promotes its own services via web searches. In Texas, antitrust investigations by the attorney general's office are ongoing, triggered by websites' complaints about their lowly Google rankings. Thanks to a judge in New York, there are now very serious doubts about Google's quest to somehow digitise every book ever published (optimistically, it has already scanned 12m of them). Meanwhile, there are rumblings about a possible watershed investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. Yesterday, Bloomberg ran a story with the headline ""Google Antitrust Probe by US Could Take Years"", and paraphrased a renowned technology lawyer: ""The agency is likely to examine whether Google is using its position in internet search to subdue rivals in adjacent markets with threats and jacked-up advertising rates."" It would certainly be a start. In the meantime, some advice, not least for employees of the US government. Don't feed the tiger. Think back to the frontier days of dial-up, when pluralism reigned. Have a look around for alternative email providers, search engines and video-sharing sites. You can find them using Google.

"The beauty of this Twitter story – apart from, see how it runs! – is how much more exciting gossip is when you have only bare bones: ""A wealthy financier attempting to have his sister-in-law and her husband jailed""; ""A TV presenter's alleged attempt to gag his ex-wife""; it's intoxicating. It sounds like the beginning of a parlour game that Martin Amis and Salman Rushdie might play. Clearly, though, there's a danger here that someone, at some point, is going to step in and make a proper distinction between the public interest and things the public are interested in. The new definition won't include anybody's love life at all – not even Prince Charles's or William Hague's! The public interest will be all government instruments and global catastrophes – such an oxymoron, because we really won't be interested. But, more to the point, unpalatable, because somewhere in the future a new generation will decide that all gossip is in the public interest, just for the leavening effect it has on the rest of the news. But by then it will be too late, because we'll have forgotten how to read and talk. Into this argument comes a book that has swivelled the subject completely. Lisa Bloom's Think: How to Stay Smart in a Dumbed Down World concludes that the problem with gossip is not that it is unfair on celebrities: the real disservice is the one we do to ourselves. It ruins our minds for higher things, it infects our personalities with the deficiencies of those we gossip about, and it has a concomitant impact on society – such that serious debate at a national level, and community undertakings at a local one, is left undone, because everybody's too busy wondering if Britney wears a wig. The book has been controversial in the US and, to a lesser degree, here, but mainly, so far, for its two least interesting aspects. First, that Bloom herself is as responsible for so-called ""celebrity culture"" as anyone, having been a legal affairs commentator for CBS and CNN. She is not known for her constitutionally important coverage; she's the woman who knows what Michael Jackson's sentence might have been, and what might happen to Lindsay Lohan. Second, the argument has been painted as a new instalment in the eternal catfight: now it's the highbrow against the mezzobrow, mothers v non-mothers, working mothers v stay-at-home mothers, fat women v thin ones. The willingness of women to define themselves against other women's deficiencies is something I find increasingly weird. Sure, it's enjoyable enough, winding yourself up about women who waste their education counting calories and what a bad advert they are for your sex. But can you ever, in a million years, imagine men doing this? Arguing among themselves about whether watching sport was more socially destructive than reading a book? So you have to leave the gender stuff aside to get anything from Bloom, and that's quite difficult, considering that it addresses itself directly to educated women. It takes its hectoring tone from the fact that we owe it to ourselves, not as people but as women, to be more serious. But I think that's just what you have to do to get published. What is interesting is Bloom's central contention about ""mirroring"". Because celebrities are by definition narcissists, our interest has normalised their solipsism. This has a number of effects: we're all in thrall to beauty regimes that are ludicrous and, more to the point, inappropriate for the woman on the street. Is there a greater waste of money than the exigencies of vanity? Probably even hedonism has more going for it than the totally fruitless and expensive battle against time. There's been a trickle-down effect, so that positions that would have been ""ironic"" in the 90s are now taken seriously – young women, according to Bloom, would in the main prefer to be run over by a truck than get fat. But there are aspects of this that are demonstrably true: before the financial crash 70% of plastic surgery in America was undertaken by people earning less than $25,000. It was one of the hardest-hit industries of the recession, because so much of it relied on credit. How can this be explained, surgery being important enough to get into debt for, unless people are imbibing the priorities of those they admire, whose own behaviour – no doubt under the pressure of our scrutiny – becomes less and less admirable? There are similar signs everywhere: The Spirit Level showed how many teenagers today, as compared with the 50s, would strongly agree with the statement: ""I am a very important person."" The authors ascribe the rise of ""defensive narcissism"" in the absence of any true feelings of worth, in societies where the value of a person is counted in cash, and many people don't have much. The cause and the effect are often indistinguishable, with a culture and its audience, but it's surely not mere coincidence that as narcissism rises, so narcissistic individuals are lauded, not judged. I am in the inequality camp, and think there is clearly more going on here than an educated class, female or not, simply deciding to worship Britney Spears. (I know … I am way behind with my worshipful females. It should be Lady Gaga.) But I love this idea, that the victims of gossip culture aren't the gossipees but the gossipers.

"As a rigid intellectual discipline, Palinology can be frustrating. Reading between the fluffed lines, ghostwritten tweets, torrential income streams and shadowy Arizona house purchases that constitute the former Alaska governor's unconventional political discourse makes Kremlinology look like the Ladybird Guide to Russian Secrets. In the context of Sarah Palin, apparently simple questions such as ""Is Africa a country?"" and ""Is she gearing up for a presidential run?"" become suddenly opaque, as experienced political watchers give up trying to discern a strategy in favour of less maddening tasks, such as juggling jelly or herding cats. Every so often, however, the strip lights flicker on – and it appears the world was being granted just such a moment of clarity this week. And so to The Undefeated, a two-hour documentary produced with Palin's blessing, as well you might imagine of an opus that reportedly compares her to Joan of Arc. Now, like the rumour that she has bought a house in Scottsdale, Arizona – a possible campaign base – I beg you not to read too much into this development. Even though the film does contain the caption: ""From here, I can see November."" And even though it will have its premiere in Iowa (I'm envisaging a Stars and Stripes carpet, and Palin saluting on it in a red sparkly dress, like the bit in Tootsie when Dustin Hoffman marches in front of the flag for a Time magazine cover). From there, it will be rolled out to the other early caucus states, while the movie was announced at the same time as a Palin bus tour of historical sites in – aha! – New England. So although I must caution against seeing this as the most sledgehammer of hints … do we dare to dream? Certainly the news forces an urgent reordering of my wishlist. Obviously the health and happiness of loved ones is important, as well as world peace, saving the whales, and putting my money where Trudie Styler's mouth is. But it is rapidly becoming clear to me that what I want most in the world, more than absolutely anything, is for Sarah Palin to run for the Republican nomination. Can you imagine? Can. You. Imagine? How long the thrill ride would last is up for debate. I am one of those who believes the spectacular implosion would occur well before Palin was tucking the nuclear button into her handbag and boarding Air Force One for her first state visit to Britain, and probably before squaring up for three Aristotelian debates – 270 minutes of TV gold! – with Barack Obama. But even a fortnight of it would be heaven. I must confess I'd assumed Palin had decided the jig was up after the midterms, which were undeniably disappointing for her, let alone after she planted the crosshairs squarely over her own foot with her grimly witless handling of the Gabrielle Giffords shooting. But here we are, heading into summer, with radioactive bore Mitt Romney her only rival in Republican polls, and a growing realisation that whatever happened, it could only increase her precious earning potential. That a run at the American presidency can be seen merely as a stepping stone to greater wealth says something about the prettiness of the pass to which we have come – but given that the Palins disport themselves like the provisional wing of the Addams family, they are unlikely to care much about the upending of such fusty old conventions. Indeed, the most fascinating aspect of a Palin run would be the chance to test Mama Grizzly's theory that the normal rules do not apply to her. This week Karl Rove – often the public face of senior Republican bewilderment at the Palin phenomenon – was cautioning that crowds turning out for this bus tour would not necessarily translate into votes, but the fact is he doesn't know. In his day, the bone idle Palin not having set foot in Iowa since last December on her book tour would have meant game over – but we are dealing with what a former colleague of Karl's would have called known unknowns, and even a few unknown ones. Once upon a time, Reagan's Marlboro Man-style campaign poster was the last word in outsiderdom. How very establishment that pose now seems, compared with the baroque nuttiness of The Undefeated. As for the wisdom of the Palin movie's title … well, you may find yourself unable to put your finger on the precise occasion, but nonetheless be beset by the nagging recollection that the old girl was defeated in some contest or other around about the 2008 mark. And those not mulling that one may be querying whether resigning the Alaska governorship midterm, amid a cloud of allegations, really counts as a win – or even a non-defeat. But you need to retune your brain to Palin logic. I can think of no neater example of this mindset than one found in her first book, Going Rogue, where madam explains how the New Deal caused the Great Depression. So, please, let's start looking at this the right way, and realise we've finally found a summer movie release to get truly excited about.","Is a Palin state visit too much to hope for?

"It has been unnerving, in recent days, to observe the scene being set by those who oppose overseas aid and who feel sneeringly confident of ultimate victory. The ""leaked"" letter from Liam Fox to David Cameron; questioning the commitment of 0.7% of gross national income by 2013; Melanie Phillips on Question Time in Wormwood Scrubs, suggesting that overseas aid be abolished and the money used for prisons (talk about a captive audience). Only Gordon Brown, in his bid for the IMF job, stood up for the world's poor, practically begging countries to keep their G8 education pledges. Meanwhile, all around there are sulky murmurings against the very notion of helping Johnny Foreigner, when we have our own deficit to deal with. ""We cannot afford to help other nations when we are struggling ourselves."" Let the scaremongering begin! Never mind the unpalatable fact that, for too long, certain regions, including Africa, were kept crippled by debts they had no hope of repaying. Or the school of thought that says the aid could still be manageable – although it would have been better applied in stages rather than in this dramatic last-minute lump, presumably designed to massage the figures into epic ""undo-ability"". Finances and affording it aside, where the ethics of aid are concerned, could we seriously afford not to? Much has been made of the fact that certain countries don't deserve aid anymore (""Russia, China, India? They're having a larf!""), but many of these are to be dropped from the register; those remaining still have huge bands of desperate poverty. Then there is the ""it goes straight to bandits or dictators"" argument. Yup, the world is complicated, but if aid agencies already have an ongoing struggle keeping a grip on chaotic infrastructures, surely robbing them of key finance is the cruellest and dumbest thing to do? Then there is the argument that these agreements were reached years ago, in ""better times"". All the more reason, then, not to renege: aid agencies depend on this financial support and have doubtless built years of strategies around it; they will be thrown into total chaos if it's removed. It is terrifying to think that the anti-aid mindset might take root, that people might end up being manipulated by self-interested politicians, anxious to divert attention away from cuts. Debate is always healthy, but this doesn't feel like a debate, more like the coalition-right slyly beginning the process of closing a door that was previously open. Or the application of the ""nudge theory"", set in place early to ensure that, by 2013, the British public will feel justified in turning its back and saying: ""Not our problem."" What seems to have been overlooked is that most Britons aren't heartless or, indeed, stupid. Post-Live Aid, it has become inbuilt in the national psyche that aid is not an unaffordable luxury, rather an economic necessity, if we don't want half the globe to collapse around us. Most of us realise that just because we are having a hard time, we can't junk our promises to people who have it worse. While some, casting around for a scapegoat, may have decided that the world's poor (anonymous, powerless, elsewhere) will do just fine, they don't speak for everybody. Indeed, it seems that those ""high up"" may be getting a little too cocky, taking their influence – what could be termed ""fear-pressure"" – over the British public for granted. It is not enough to plant some kind of anti-aid Gollum next to the collective ear to hiss: ""Charity begins at home, my precious!"" Flinging their nationalism right back at them, it is simply not the British way to stamp on the fingers of the desperate and watch impassively as they fall. This is truly the best of us and let us hope it won't only be Gordon Brown who'll keep the flag flying. Have enfants terribles had their day? Has the concept of the enfant terrible had its day? Film director Lars von Trier, questioned on past comments about his fondness for the ""Nazi aesthetic"", launched into a ridiculous ""Oh yeah, I'm a Nazi, I dig Hitler. Whatever! Not bovvered!"" routine. Not what he said verbatim, but you get the general idea. Then there is Dr Satoshi Kanazawa from the LSE, publishing his ""controversial"" findings on black women being less attractive than other races (because of too much testosterone, he concluded). Kicked out of the Cannes film festival for his remarks, von Trier apologised and said he didn't hate Jews. He might even have got away with it had it not been for John Galliano's drunken, antisemitic outburst in February. As for Kanazawa's findings – from where I'm standing, the likes of Beyoncé, Naomi Campbell, Iman and Tyra Banks are none too shabby. Nor does Rihanna appear to be suffering from too much testosterone (aimed at her, perhaps, but that's another story). Actually, most of us are aware that it is perceptions of ethnic beauty that should be the hot topic of discussion. Intriguingly, both von Trier and Kanazawa were almost instantly slapped down. None of this ""wow, controversial!"" baloney. Rather, an immediate: ""Just shut up."" Interesting. It is as if we have suddenly come down en masse with bullshit fatigue. Traditionally, the enfant terrible has been rewarded with praise, censure, but, above all, oodles of yummy attention. This they crave above all, because most of them are narcissists who will take any attention, even purely negative, over nothing at all. They should watch out. The brisk treatment of Kanazawa and von Trier suggests that, despite their best troublemaking efforts, they could be falling out of vogue. Gwynnie, you deserve a good dressing-down  Gwyneth Paltrow is in trouble for publishing her ideas for spring fashion staples – six outfits that cost almost 12 grand. She called them ""great pieces which are versatile"", not realising that, for most women this versatility would have to run to being wearable equally for doing the can-can or making supper to justify those prices. It's not entirely Gwyneth's fault. There has been a trend in recent times away from celebrities who are glamorous and Old Hollywood towards those we can relate to, who could be our ""bezzie mates"", if they weren't rich and famous (which they hate being, because they're so darned down to earth and decent, etc, etc). All this Ordinary Joe bunkum turns to ashes when they start advising people to splash out 12 bags of sand on one set of clobber for three months' wear. For most women, ""spring staples"" means having a quick sniff of last year's wedge sandals to make sure they haven't grown mould. Paltrow should be aware – she isn't being punished for her Marie Antoinette ""Let them wear Prada"" ways, rather for letting her ""Everywoman"" mask slip to reveal the super-rich actress beneath.",Cutting overseas aid is simply not the British way | Barbara Ellen,2011-05-21T23:03:06Z,Barbara Ellen,politics
"The people of the Pacific island of Tanna worship Prince Philip. His arrival in nearby islands in the past has been has been greeted with eating, drinking and general bonhomie. The Prince Philip Movement believes that the more it worships at his shrine, the better the chances of a bonanza of good things. Human beings seem to have an inbuilt desire for worship, however irrational, although the cargo cults across the Pacific can at least see an association between the landing craft, aircraft or even consorts of western monarchs they worship and subsequent prosperity. The free market, right-of-centre Institute of Economic Affairs, urging the abolition of all government subsidy to the railways and full privatisation of the rail system, does not even have that excuse. The Tanna islanders observed a relationship between what they revere and happiness, however daffy. Rail privatisation has been a disaster, but that does not inhibit the need of the devout IEA to worship at the shrine. The IEA was responding to a two-year investigation by Sir Roy McNulty into how to get better value for money from the billions poured into Britain's rail system. Since privatisation, the annual subsidy to cover rail running costs has quintupled to more than £5bn, Network Rail, which owns the track, has seen its debts explode to more than £20bn, and all to support a rail system with the highest costs and highest fares in Europe. Yet the British have rediscovered the urge to travel by rail. If the parameters are not changed and demand for rail travel doubles over the next 20 years, as is forecast, the subsidy and public debts of the rail industry will become unsustainable. Something must change. Rail privatisation was sold by the Major government with the same ideological, manic worship of the mantra ""private and competition are best"" as Andrew Lansley and David Cameron try to sell today's reform of the NHS. It would lower costs and offer more choice. At the time, it was clear to the non-devout that the rail system could no more be successfully fragmented as the price of privatisation than the armed services or the National Trust could be broken up successfully to compete with former parts of the integrated whole. Logic dictated that the old British Rail  had to be privatised and regulated as a single organisational unit. But why, pray, would taxpayers want to enrich a newly created private monopoly? Yet breaking it up to avoid creating a private monopoly, separating the provision of rail services from the ownership of the track, would wreck that organisational logic. It would lead straight to rising public subsidy, rising fares and structural inefficiency. But Britain's pro-privatisation movement held sway then, as it does now. McNulty knows the lie of the land. To discuss the merits of privatisation is off-limits. He thinks there could be hundreds of millions of cost saving – from better integration and co-ordination between the rail companies and Network Rail which owns the track, from better management of assets, and from better organisation of the chain that supplies the entire industry. He describes a baleful world in which the train-operating companies, with short-term profit horizons made worse by the brief duration of the operating licences, have zero incentive to cut costs, and Network Rail has no incentive to do anything efficiently to grow traffic volume, focusing entirely on spending whatever it needs to avoid another Hatfield disaster. As you read the long list of why costs, and thus fares, are so high, it is obvious they have an umbilical link with the way the rail industry was privatised – keeping the track owned and run by one company, giving freight to yet others and offering licences to operate rolling stock and the passenger services to even more . This has led to structural inefficiency and ballooning of costs, but this McNulty cannot openly ascribe to privatisation. McNulty's exercise comparing Britain's rail costs with four other European systems is hair-raising. For reasons McNulty is at a loss to explain (but probably due to industry fragmentation), Britain uses any given train on its network much less frequently and effectively than the Europeans, while anything from laying track to servicing rolling stock is hugely more expensive. Passenger traffic has increased by more than half over the last 14 years; more traffic should mean lower unit costs; instead, they have hardly budged. As a result, there is an efficiency gap of more than 30%. McNulty sets a target of 2019 to eliminate the gap (five years longer than the coalition gives the public sector). Yet, because he is unable to consider proposing structural change, he has to rely on a newly established Rail Delivery Group to tackle the issues, comprising the very same industry leaders whose incentives have created the costs that they are now supposed to lower. Martin Gilbert, chair of First Group, speaks for the industry when he declares in the company's annual statement that the financial interests of shareholders – not passengers or taxpayers – remain the company's overriding interest. All the executive teams at the train-operating companies have the panoply of bonus, share option and long-term incentive plans that British companies have imported from the US. Privatisation zealots believe that getting up the share price and doing the right thing on costs should be in perfect harmony. But in reality, a long-term efficiency strategy must mean paying attention to long-term issues, such as ensuring there are enough engineers, planning to guarantee trains are in the right place at the right time and managing contractors so they deliver on time and on budget. This is time-consuming and, in the short term, expensive – holding back near-term profit growth, essential for a high share price and personal enrichment. The British stock market's priorities have interlocked with an irrational industry structure and the result is the most inefficient and expensive rail system in Europe. Pay rates for some rail workers and their working practices hardly help matters: some of the practices that the unions defend to the last are just plain wrong. But they are hardly the core of the problem. In any case, the industry leadership to whom the task falls of making the case for workplace change is in no position to talk about remuneration restraint and commitment to efficiency. What is required is a wholesale restructuring of the industry – and organising our companies so they can take a more rounded view of their business than just the immediate share price. Without that, more fare increases, reduced services and cattle truck conditions for our long-suffering commuters are inevitable. Privatisation zealots are at the wheel. Prepare for the worst.","When we sold off the railways, we created today's shambles | Will Hutton",2011-05-21T23:02:01Z,Will Hutton,uk
"Ignorance is an easy thing to live with and, perhaps for that reason, common. Reading a disturbing book this week, I remembered a cheerful scene from my own life: a Chinese restaurant more than 30 years ago, a plate of chicken fried rice, the Bee Gees singing Stayin' Alive on the tape machine. It was my birthday lunch in Khulna, a town in Bangladesh that we'd reached that morning by the overnight steamer from Dhaka. I was with a photographer. What interested us? I recall a rickshaw ride in the cool-season sunshine and being paddled across a river in a flimsy boat to look at a steam locomotive on the far bank. We must have had several conversations with people who lived in the town, but nobody mentioned the massacres of eight years before. Then again, we didn't know to ask. The details are in a soon-to-be-published book – Dead Reckoning: Memories of the Bangladesh War – by an Oxford academic, Sarmila Bose. As all good history tends to do, it complicates and contradicts the simple, heroic narrative of national struggle. For 40 years, the world's perception of the conflict that gave birth to Bangladesh has been dominated by what Bose calls ""the ultimate word-number combination"" – the genocide of 3 million people. Bose grew up with the idea, as the child of a well-to-do Bengali family in Kolkata. Roughly, it goes like this. In trying to repress a popular rebellion in east Pakistan, an army from west Pakistan slaughters, rapes and tortures the civilian population until India intervenes and independence is secured. Ethnicity separates a Punjabi army from its Bengali victims. Millions die for no other reason than a difference in identity – in language, diet, dress and customs (though not religion, which is how two places separated by a thousand miles of India originally came to sink their differences in one Islamic state). What the story forgets is the prelude. At Khulna, for example, there was a kind of genocide, but it was perpetrated by Bengalis against the non-Bengalis they worked beside in the town's jute mills. The non-Bengalis were mainly Urdu-speaking migrants from Bihar, Muslims who had fled India at partition. On 28 March 1971, their fellow workers slaughtered large numbers of them, sometimes methodically in what Bose calls slaughter houses that had been set up inside the mills. Exact numbers will never be known; a reasonable estimate is several thousand men, women and children. According to testimony collected by Bose, their bloated corpses clogged the rivers for days. This happened before the Pakistan army embarked on its countrywide repression. After its defeat, with Bangladesh's independence established, Khulna's Bengali mill workers repeated their original atrocity of the previous year and sent thousands more non-Bengalis into the rivers. They were seen as traitors who supported the wrong side. These and many other similar bloodbaths were hardly a secret. The Pakistan government, led as usual by a general, was anxious to project the army's role as bringers of order to a country that was sliding quickly towards civil war. Even in the days of crackling landlines and unreliable telex machines, reports got out depicting scenes of cruelty and confusion. Then, on 18 June 1971, the Sunday Times published a long piece of reportage that more than any other single piece of journalism changed how the world saw, and would remember, the conflict inside Bangladesh. The writer, Anthony Mascarenhas, had been flown from his home in Karachi to Dhaka by the Pakistan military to report on the army's good work, but he returned with a different story, unpublishable by Mascarenhas's newspaper or any other in Pakistan. Instead, he'd flown with it to London to meet the Sunday Times's then editor, Harold Evans. According to Evans's autobiography, Mascarenhas told him that the army's outrages against Bengalis far outweighed those of Bengalis against non-Bengalis. Hindus in particular were army targets. Senior officers had told him that they were seeking a ""final solution"", determined ""to cleanse east Pakistan once and for all of the threat of secession, even if it means killing 2 million people and ruling the province as a colony for 30 years."" His eyewitness testimony and sincerity were impressive. Once his wife and family had been evacuated from Pakistan – neither he nor they could ever go back – the paper ran the story across two pages under the headline: GENOCIDE. Indira Gandhi, then India's prime minister, later told Evans that it had set her on a campaign of personal diplomacy that prepared the ground for armed intervention. It was a courageous act of reporting, and it may have changed the world for the better; the US never offered more than lukewarm support for its ally, Pakistan, which was defeated in weeks. Bose's book, however, raises troubling questions about the report's complete veracity – a massacre said to have killed 8,000 Hindus probably killed only 16 at most – as well as its effect. Soon after the war ended, a prediction (or threat) of 2 million dead had been elevated to the widely publicised fact of 3 million dead, which is still commonly accepted in India and Bangladesh. A truth about the Bangladesh war is that remarkably few scholars and historians have given it thorough, independent scrutiny. Bose's research has taken her from the archives to interviews with elderly peasants in Bangladesh and retired army officers in Pakistan. Her findings are significant. She estimates that during the conflict of 1971 a total of somewhere between 50,000 and 100,000 combatants and non-combatants perished on all sides. Much beyond 100,000 and ""one enters a world of meaningless speculation"". As to genocide, it would be more accurate to accuse the Pakistan army of political killing. Many Bengalis remained loyal to the old regime and went unharmed. The army and its paramilitaries (who were mainly Biharis) were at their most genocidal in their persecution of Hindu Bengali men, whom they believed as a group to be disloyal. By contrast, many Bengali Muslim civilians attacked non-Bengalis and Bengali Hindus purely on the grounds of their ethnic or religious identity and/or for material gain. In terms of genocide, their guilt is much clearer. Does this arithmetic and legalism matter? It happened 40 years ago and it's all very complicated – a shifting kaleidoscope of religious and linguistic difference and political loyalties, animated by old prejudices and fresh desires. The savagery is at times unbearable to read. In the words of Michael Ignatieff on the Balkans conflict: ""When people are sufficiently afraid, they will do anything ... ethnic hatred is the result of the terror that arises when legitimate authority disintegrates."" But it's not the only human habit that continues. Every day, foreign conflicts with complicated origins reach us dressed with appealing simplicity: a besieged town needs to be relieved, an autocrat removed, a regime changed – do these things and all will be better, if not exactly well. If nothing else, Bose's account warns us of how much we need to find out.",It's not the arithmetic of genocide that's important.

"For some 40 years, the American neo-conservative right has led an ever-more vehement crusade against the idea of the state. The aim has been to conflate the state with discredited socialism. The quest for a socialist utopia, runs the argument, has proved economically inefficient and politically coercive; because socialists deployed the state to achieve their ends, the state is thus economically inefficient and politically coercive as well. The superior form of economic and social organisation is a minimal state in a universe of moral individuals, families and companies freely contracting with one another in free markets. This movement has reached its apogee in two fundamentalist political movements – the American Tea Party movement and, unexpectedly, the British Conservative party. In the weeks ahead, the Republicans are set to refuse to lift the ceiling on the US national debt unless the Democrats accept a decisive down-payment in cutting US federal spending towards pre-modern levels. They want to reduce the US government to the scale it was in the late 19th century, even if it involves the hitherto unthinkable idea that the US government may default on its debts. Francis Fukuyama, a former favourite of the neocons, but increasingly disillusioned by how they led George W Bush disastrously to invade Iraq while indulging the recklessness that caused the financial crisis, has become more and more alarmed by the nihilism of modern American conservatism. It has become a potentially fatal virus undermining the American political system, which is now showing the same alarming traits as other systems that could not deliver good government – the French Bourbons, the Confucian emperors and even the late Ottoman empire. But while those regimes all collapsed because they could not create the trinity of state, law and accountability, on which the political capability to address their problems would have rested, the US possesses such institutions – except modern American conservatism wants to eviscerate them. Worse, it is partially succeeding. Fukuyama wants no part in the depiction of the state as the enemy of liberty and capitalism. Rather, he sees the state in positive and conservative terms – as one of the foundations upon which sound political order rests. Without political order, communities rob themselves of the capability to fight and win wars, manage technological change and reconcile inevitable human rivalries and feuds. We return to savagery. In this respect, the book is something of a landmark: it and its successor (which will take the story up to the present from the French revolution, where this volume ends) may be seen as one of the harbingers of the Tea Party movement and its little British echo reaching their high-water mark. Their political philosophy menaces the functioning state on which political order depends. The assumptions that the Founding Fathers made – that all Americans are bound by common values and common expectations that there should be a state, rule of law and accountability – are being fractured. The neoconservatives have become part of the crisis the US has to solve and, given the political deadlock that now characterises Washington, there is not much time. This is thus an immensely long letter to his fellow conservatives, reminding them that if social institutions such as marriage and the family are important, so too are state institutions. Fukuyama likes to argue by assembling an enormous weight of historical evidence to support his case and the core of the book is a Cook's tour of why and how varying civilisations have set about creating states, systems of political accountability and the rule of law. The enemies of political order are partisanship and cronyism – of family, kinship and tribe doing everything in their power to keep their grip on property and economic rent. This ossifies and holds back the development of the economy and, ultimately, threatens the soundness, security and resilience of the wider society. We are treated to accounts of how Spain buckled under the weight of its economically inactive aristocracy, China developed a highly competitive examination system for access to its mandaranite to stop jobs being given to family members, and how the institution of military slavery was created by Islamic and Ottoman rulers to avoid reliance on aristocratic family dynasties always tempted into internecine and destabilising rivalry. Some parts are banal and familiar; others, like the story of the mamluks in the Ottoman empire, new and riveting. All societies had to resolve the destructive impact of family cronyism and Fukuyama reminds us how Plato believed that families undermined the good republic. But it is not enough to have a state that is built on impartial rules. There also has to be law to ensure the rules are followed and systems of accountability to make sure that the law is implemented. And all have to be embodied in functioning legitimate institutions. Britain's rise to industrial prominence came about because it was the first society to create the institutional trinity. Fukuyama's account of 17th-century England is too thin for my liking and far too focused on state structures. What laid the foundation of the industrial revolution was that England equipped itself not just with political order but with an entire Enlightenment infrastructure and value system that enabled it to support industrial entrepreneurship. A free press; free scientific inquiry; the development of banking and the spirit of Enlightenment progress: all were crucial in the cocktail. Economic historian Joel Mokyr has set out the whole story in his masterwork, The Enlightened Economy, and it's dismaying that Fukuyama seems ignorant of his thesis. In this respect, he has still not escaped the free market fundamentalist categories in which he used to think. Markets, as much as the political realm, need institutions in which to work effectively too. None the less, he does have the bottle to take on the darling of neo-conservatism, Friedrich Hayek, who had a romantic attachment to British common law that he characterised as emerging spontaneously from British individualism. It was so effective, thought Hayek, because no central political authority had designed it or could design it, proof positive of the uselessness of the state and superiority of individual decision-making. Fukuyama shows that Hayek was 100% historically wrong. British common law only grew because of the universal court system created by the Normans: it was a product of the Norman state. All this may seem arcane, but I agree with Fukuyama that the US – and Britain – is in thrall to a set of neo-conservative ideas both profoundly mistaken and very dangerous. This book is part of the intellectual fight-back, importantly written by a conservative, laying the foundations to hit neo-conservatism very hard indeed. He plainly implies they are nutters who are the enemies of the west. He is assembling the ammunition. In his next volume he must fire it – and not miss.",The Origins of Political Order by Francis Fukuyama – review,2011-05-20T13:11:12Z,Will Hutton,review

"I like George Michael. I think there is an elegance and honesty about him, even when he's driving cars into branches of Snappy Snaps. I also liked the way he calmly told Elton John to back off, when the reformed coke-snorting King of Excess turned self-styled saviour of celebrity souls embarked on his crusade to make younger famous people see the error of their wild ways (just like Mother Teresa/Elton hadn't for about three decades). Then there are songs such as ""One More Try"", a soul-ripping ballad worthy of Aretha Franklin. There is much to like about George Michael. So why is he apologising and in such a bizarre fashion? At a press conference to announce his European tour, Michael said that he was sorry that young gay kids had suffered abuse and humiliation as a result of his high-profile antics. ""My behaviour meant these kids suffered abuse and the homophobic language that is legal in this country."" Michael said that his next album would reflect this, featuring gay and gay-friendly artists. He added that he wanted to help ""gay children"". ""We're notoriously bad as a community in helping children, because we don't have our own children."" Hmm. Hasn't he heard of Elton and David's happy baby news or the fact that gay adoption is rather popular these days? Moreover, who exactly are these ""gay children"", how old are they in Michael's mind and is it dangerous for him to be mentioning them? There seem to be a few strands at work here. Is Michael thinking of, say, 16- to 17-year-olds? Anything younger and could they really be classed as ""gay children""? It's likely that Michael is thinking of isolated young people, already aware that they are different, and sometimes afraid of that fact. This raises the issue of what gay means when you're not lucky enough to be brought up in liberal communities. For the majority, it is the stereotyped camp element of homosexuality that is the most amplified, not least by the straight community, which can be liberating, but also frightening. Graham Norton once said that when he was young, Larry Grayson unnerved him because that was what gay was supposed to be. Norton later worried that young gay people might be thinking the same about him. With this in mind, is Michael guilty of the heinous crime of bad gay PR? To my knowledge, getting off your head and driving into a branch of Snappy Snaps is not classified as a gay crime. Nor is there anything definitively gay about nodding off in your car, in a crumpled T-shirt, when the paparazzi are around. Daft maybe, but not gay. Apart from the infamous incident in the LA public loo, 13 years ago, there is nothing gay about Michael's public behaviour, nor is he a camp individual generally. Therefore it is unlikely that his actions have generated abuse and humiliation for young gay people. As for the poor gay children – it sounds like a long-lost Brass Eye sketch. No one is arguing that sexuality magically arrives at the age of consent. However, with all the homophobia swirling around, perhaps Michael should rethink his terminology. It's not as if we ever think of straight children – they are just children. The fact they are viewed legally as children gives them protection and it feels unwise to bring sexuality into it. Michael has no need to apologise – there was nothing predominantly gay about his Snappy Snaps escapade, just as there was nothing predominantly straight about Britney's head-shaving meltdown. As for the gay children, I think we all know what he meant, but maybe Michael should voice that thought differently lest it play into the wrong prejudiced hands.  Meet the minister for lifts and litter How proactive of the defence minister, Andrew Robathan, to intervene when he caught a ""young blonde woman"" stepping into a lift reserved for MPs. On being shown proof that she was, in fact, Stella Creasy, a ""young blonde woman"" indeed, but also Labour MP for Walthamstow, Robathan remarked that she looked too young to be an MP and declined to apologise. Robathan later remarked, somewhat randomly, that he always challenged people who dropped litter and wouldn't be stopping that either. It's hard to imagine what must have been Stella Creasy's delight to be thought too young to be an MP. ""Oh good sir, you make me blush at your delicious impertinence,"" she might have simpered, had this been a bad Jane Austen production, and not a woman just trying to do her job at Westminster. Then there is the revelation that there is a special lift just for MPs. Does it have customised buttons, reading in descending order ""Higher office"", ""Lower office"", ""Liberal Democrat""? What happens when a genuine nobody gets into the special lift – does it close like a defective automatic public loo, deluging the miscreant with jets of Toilet Duck? I'm also intrigued by Robathan's lifelong crusade – one he refuses to relinquish – against litter louts. A mental image appears of Robathan, a former SAS man, dropping on a rope from a helicopter to break litter louts' necks between his thighs. Even if this is not the case, who needs watertight national security when we have a defence minister wandering the streets, ticking people off for dropping Cornetto wrappers? I already feel a lot safer, don't you? Keep sweating the small stuff, Mr Robathan. After Maddie, where does the PM draw the line? As I wrote last week, I have every sympathy for Kate and Gerry McCann. I can understand why they wrote an open letter in the Sun asking David Cameron to review Madeleine's case. What did seem odd was Cameron's instant, protocol-breaking offer of help. The cynical mindset is that, in all the time Cameron has been prime minister, it took an open letter to make him feel that he had to act. Does this have the whiff of engineered populism about it? On the other hand, Cameron is probably genuinely sympathetic to the McCanns. In fact, he only did what I'd have done – cry: ""To hell with protocol, let's help the McCanns!"" But that's why I'm not prime minister. Indeed – and this is not the McCanns' problem – where does this special attention end? Scotland Yard is said to be concerned about possible implications regarding other cases. The government may find itself in a moral quagmire: there are other missing people, with loved ones just as desperate. Where do you draw the line? Understandably, the McCanns aren't asking too many questions about the wider ramifications of their latest lifeline, but perhaps others will have to.",George Michael crashing into Snappy Snaps doesn't encourage homophobia | Barbara Ellen,2011-05-14T23:06:07Z,Barbara Ellen,uk
"The great thing about marriage, as the comic and actress Rita Rudner once said, is finding that one special person you want to annoy for the rest of your life. Unless, that is, you choose to annoy them by playing talk radio all day, for there is only so much a person can realistically be expected to take. The case last week of the anonymous husband served with divorce papers on the grounds of excessive listening to BBC Radio 5 Live serves as a warning not merely to news junkies. The last straw seems to have been not so much his passion for phone-ins as his attempts to make his wife share it. ""I tried to tell her interesting things that I'd actually heard on 5 Live to pacify her, but as soon as I said that I'd heard it on 5 Live then the shutters would go down,"" he said plaintively (speaking, inevitably, on a phone-in). Apparently, she hurled his radio to the bottom of the garden. Yet had he built a soundproofed shed down there and taken the radio into it, would they still be married? There is possibly no greater threat to coupledom than the crazy idea that love is all about sharing one another's interests. Love is surely knowing when to run like hell from the other's godawful interests, thus preserving the happy fiction that they are still the thrilling person you fell in love with. Better a slightly resentful golf widow than having to play the game yourself. Most couples don't take this art of strategic separateness quite as far as the married writers Margaret Drabble and Michael Holroyd, who lived devotedly for years in Hampstead and Ladbroke Grove respectively, overnighting at each other's houses by turn. But whether it's separate beds, separate sinks or merely separate friends, nothing beats maintaining a small metaphorical room of one's own. And while a few may use that room to exercise their creative genius, perhaps the most useful thing to do in it is to unleash one's inner bore. Few of us are capable of being fascinating forever, not even to ourselves, which means time together should really be rationed if most couples are to last the distance. The moral majority gnash their teeth over late motherhood and marriage, but dawdling on the way to the altar is probably wise. Life expectancy being what it now is, getting hitched in one's 40s drags out the ""still trying"" phase of a relationship nicely while leaving perhaps as little as 45 years of married life during which to rack one's brains for new topics of conversation. Actress Harriet Walter, who recently announced she is to marry for the first time aged 60, is perhaps on to something. But for those who lacked such foresight, being happily partnered for a half century or more means making room for dullness. A successful relationship must set aside private space for those pursuits that make the other person want to run screaming down the street: anything involving balsa wood, keeping a scrapbook of pictures of the royal wedding or a keen interest in electoral reform. Why else did mankind invent the shed, the greenhouse, the attic? And there is always blogging. Having spent the last few months reading hundreds of entries for the Orwell prize for political blogging, it has been my genuine pleasure as a judge to stumble across some truly terrific, original, sharp writing. But to be brutally honest, it's also meant encountering one or two posts which were almost certainly only ever lovingly reread by their authors. It was these achingly detailed treatises on obscure factions in 19th-century leftwing thought, however, that somehow moved me the most, not least because they have probably saved countless marriages. All those spouses, valiantly suppressing yawns through decades of late-night homilies about the evolution of neo-anarchism, until the blissful day the web was invented and they could finally say: ""How clever, darling. Why don't you type it all up for posterity?"" and put The Archers back on. Even before blogging, there was the diary. The contents of Osama bin Laden's private handwritten journal, as opposed to his extensive computer files, have yet to be fully disclosed, but if any evidence should emerge that one of his wives helpfully suggested he keep it, then the CIA can probably stand down the translators. The true skill of finding happiness apart, however, is knowing exactly when it's necessary to come back together. It's not clear whether Mr Radio 5 Live had children, but if he did one can certainly see his wife's point. As a general rule, it stops being acceptable to hide in the shed all day as soon as there are small fists hammering on the door. It's not compulsory to take the parental bonding thing as seriously as did the model Miranda Kerr, who revealed last week that when in labour with their son, she made husband Orlando Bloom urinate in a bottle rather than dash to the loo and miss anything. It's not every woman who is generously prepared to share with her partner the uniquely painful bladder sensations usually known only to those in the very late, very squashed stages of pregnancy. But one of the best pieces of advice I was given before having children was that the biological purpose of mating for life is to have someone else to bore witless with the anecdotes about your children that only really interest the two of you. The dawn of parenthood is the one time it is essential to live in each other's pockets, not merely to spare the rest of us the evidence that your newborn is actually seriously gifted – no, really, look at the way she's nearly rolling over! – but to preserve each other's sanity. You can't share anything, from the white nights of sleeplessness to the bittersweet elation of their growing up, if one of you is constantly plugged into Victoria Derbyshire. And neither can you do so if one of you is permanently plugged into the office. So liberal-minded families should brace themselves for the unusual experience of being grateful to the coalition, as it draws up plans for overhauling what Nick Clegg once called the ""Edwardian"" system of laws governing maternity and paternity leave. For all last week's retro blustering about curbing sex discrimination payouts, these separate proposals to encourage ""shared parenting"" – with fathers able to spend much more time at home with a new baby, if they want – represent something of a watershed moment for the domestic balance of power. There is a more enlightened vein running through this government's thinking about the family than is often recognised. Although it would be boring to bang on about that too much.",We all need space in which to be a crashing bore | Gaby Hinsliff,2011-05-14T23:02:04Z,Gaby Hinsliff,uk
"Can you bear to watch the Goldsmith family hit ideological puberty? Of all the awkward sights currently on offer in public life, the spectacle of Jimmy Goldsmith's children and heirs attempting to direct the debate about privacy and freedom of expression is surely among the most excruciating. If only we could superinjunct the whole embarrassing business, and thus spare ourselves the spectacle of Zac Goldsmith and Jemima Khan adopting outlandish logical contortions that really do belong behind closed doors. To recap: Jemima Khan (Goldsmith as was) is the freedom of information champion – ""Twitter's greatest advocate"", as she described herself last year – who recently used an infinitesimal amount of her gazillion-pound inheritance to post bail for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. On Monday she awoke to what she called ""a bloody nightmare"" as a Twitter user falsely claimed that she had taken out a superinjunction to prevent intimate photos of her and Jeremy Clarkson becoming public. Well. Were the union a matter of fact, it would surely represent history's greatest instance of a man punching above his weight (don't forget Quasimodo never actually pulled Esmeralda). But it is a fabrication, possibly chinese-whispered out of the fact that Jemima and Zac did take out a privacy injunction in 2008 when their emails were hacked. So now our WikiLeaks devotee – Jemima is particularly passionate about ""the free flow of information in this digital age"" – is frightfully cross that someone has published sensational material with no regard for its consequences. She insists people distinguish between government and corporate transparency and an individual's privacy, to which the only response is: have you been on the internet lately? People do not care to distinguish between the importance of a North Korean nuclear test and whether Miley Cyrus is wearing knickers. Good luck regulating it. Perhaps Jemima really is unable to see that in the brave new technological world it is impossible to have freedom of information without freedom of misinformation. But she will find it difficult to escape the irony that the existence of the Goldsmith siblings' superinjunction was first revealed by a certain website close to her heart. WikiLeaks: proudly bringing you details of secret US drone strikes and minor celebrity gagging orders since 2006. And so to brother Zac, who this week called for parliament to make a privacy law – as though they'd do any better balancing the competing claims of the European convention on human rights than the judges do, on a case-by-case basis. Can you warm to Zac? ""I do not need a career in this world,"" he declared loftily a few years ago, adding: ""In 10 years' time I might be an eco-terrorist. But I'll take the most effective path, whatever that is."" No doubt, no doubt. It subsequently emerged that the ""most effective path"" had been to retain the non-domiciled tax status he had inherited, a privilege he relinquished in 2009, about 27 minutes before standing for parliament. So while Zac's attempts to cast himself as some kind of radical add to the gaiety of the nation, he'll forgive us if we take them as seriously as the idea of Clarkson giving his sister one. Much is made of Zac's charm, but it might be helpful to distinguish between good looks, which he undoubtedly has, and charm, of which he is in shorter supply. Try to imagine his public pronouncements being made by someone with the visage of George Osborne, and they boast all the charm of a minibreak in Mogadishu. If Zac loses his hair and puts on 30lbs by 2025, you might as well hand him the white cat. He is a chip off the old block. Goldsmith père once stormed off the Money Programme after being questioned in a manner that displeased him, a moment echoed by his son's infamous Channel 4 News interview concerning his election expenses last year. Indeed, given his father issued more than 60 writs against Private Eye in a single year and tried to get its editor imprisoned, it is perhaps inevitable that Zac should decline to devote his time to the more worthwhile reform of laws which have turned this country into the libel capital of the world. This week he preferred to wheel out that old chestnut about the need ""to distinguish between what is in the public interest and what is merely of prurient interest to some of the public"". Yet that aphorism now seems a relic of an age both more civilised and less civilised. From newspapers to rich men to government agencies, those used to controlling and deciding what the public are interested in are either playing catch-up or seeing their powers profoundly warped. Perhaps Zac and Jemima wonder what sort of world we live in when inherited wealth can buy bail for a freedom of information radical but cannot silence the free exchange of information and – alas – misinformation among the public. But while they mull it over, a period of self-imposed privacy from them would be most welcome. The posturings of the Goldsmith family may titillate us and give us all a laugh, but it should be perfectly obvious to all civilised people that they are really not the proper business of public life.",Zac and Jemima's posturing – who'll superinjunct that? | Marina Hyde,2011-05-13T19:00:00Z,Marina Hyde,politics
"Right from the get-go Dave said Perkins was a mind-reader because even before we ask her to do something, like tell Lansley that Dave is still in the bath, she does it anyway, and by the time we got to Chequers she'd organised a cake, a candle and blue balloons saying One Year Old! plus canapes, champagne and kale-water for Hilto, who is on the Gwynnie detox, with the blinds down so nobody would tell Cleggsy because it is so vital to respect his total loserdom, Hilto's orders are keep him sweet until he gives the go-ahead for dumpage. So naturally Cleggsy was texting non-stop and it was classic rofl rofl, because when Dave finally called him back on speakerphone he was literally sobbing about AV, Hilto fell off the sofa in hysterics, there was kale everywhere, Teresa had to stuff a curtain into Fellowes's mouth and Dave was going ""absolutely, very poor show, Oik really should know better"", and when Cleggsy started bleating about Lords reform the Fartmeister actually mooned at his voice, I thought Govey would explode.

"Wake up. The honeymoon is over. Back to reality. Even princes have to go to work like normal people. And Kate, who has opted to be a full-time RAF officer's wife, can wave him off, as she is now living the dream on Anglesey. The dream means running her husband baths, watching him play polo and attending the odd charity bash with him. Apparently, she wanted this old-fashioned role, which some call wife, but I call ""lovely assistant"". Indeed, despite the palace's plea for privacy after the nuptial glut, it may well be impossible for Kate to ""work"" because of the huge amount of attention on her. It has to be said, though, that up until now, Kate's jobs have seemed fairly token. Has this woman ever been financially independent? It seems rather she has spent her time being groomed to be a wife. That such grooming allows ""a commoner"" into the royals represents a triumph for the bourgeoisie. Last week's entrenching of establishment values, amid middlebrow mores and faux militarism, was lapped up by some. Many were indifferent. Few were stirred by pure republicanism, which remains abstract, but nonetheless we were repeatedly addressed as though we were all avid royalists. Royalists needed to pimp their romantic fantasy alongside their tea towels 24/7. The fantasy is that romance is always transformative. Mermaids get legs! Girls from the home counties get castles! The problem is that we know too much about the Middleton background to pretend this all happened naturally. The Middletons were on full display; a small business compared to the firm, but there is something rather corporate and manufactured about them. We have been invited both to sneer at them for social climbing, and to identify with them for their hard work and ""ordinariness"". Their back story represents almost a primer in the history of social mobility. From mining stock, Carole Middleton became an air hostess. She met her husband Michael while he was working as an air steward. They set up a family business selling party bags online. They made enough – we don't know how much, as their company is run as a partnership, so we don't see how much tax they pay – to send their three children to Marlborough College. As is always the way, it's the woman, Carole, who is seen as socially aspirational and pushy. Her girls, Catherine and Pippa, have been called ""the wisteria sisters"", as they are adept in social climbing. It is a recurring motif from Austen to Osborne that women are the schemers who dream of an upwardly mobile escape. It is Carole, too, who is said to have made the ""gaffes""; saying the wrong thing to the Queen, chewing nicotine gum at Sandhurst. It is Carole's prawn-and-cottage-cheese diet we know about. It is Carole who was laughed at when she was finally invited to Balmoral. There she was, laying flat out in the damp grass with a ghillie to instruct her in deer stalking. Nothing could signal the gap between the Middletons and the aristocracy more than this. The Middletons may like the races and have shares in a horse, but they don't kill large animals for fun. Blood sports are the province of our ruling classes, from our Queen to David Cameron. The bourgeoisie simply have to accept this is the way things are done. The values of the Middletons' class – hard work, respect for property and insular family life – are actually at odds with those of the aristocracy, who don't work and inherit wealth. But the wedding achieved a sleight of hand in its illusion of harmony. Thus, the Middletons were the stars of the show. Carole was deemed to have dressed well enough. Pippa, upstaged by her own backside, is the new top totty. James, who until now was known mainly as a cross-dressing cake-maker who liked posting pictures of himself naked on Facebook, has been reinvented as a speechifying young blade. Indeed, the Middletons, in outfits and behaviour, were conservative enough. It was the royals who wore what they bloody well liked, with Beatrice and Eugenie cleverly suggesting Spiker and Sponge from Roald Dahl's James and the Giant Peach. The dress, which was said to melt the hardest of republican hearts (really?), was a McQueen effort, with any radical edge softened, and unsurprisingly retro. Nothing to frighten the horses. Kate looked suitably demure. Except for the double nipple effect that this couture provided. The pretence of virginity is part of the facade, after all. The prince's mother, as if we could forget, was sacrificed on that altar. This wedding served to remind us, though, that the Diana moment is long gone. Since about 2002 the royals have got their PR in order. The success of their press operation is manifest in the uniform nature of the fawning coverage. Consent was assumed: we were all, we were repeatedly told, thrilled by this occasion. Hegemony was secured as Harry grinned at Pippa. The boring bits of the service, or the shots of most of the congregation unable to sing any of the hymns, were glossed over. The celebration of reactionary values was duly achieved, by assuming we are all bound up in them. No wonder the Labour politicians – at least those invited – looked so out of place. This was the ruling class en masse, preening itself for letting in ""a commoner"". Us commoners should be duly grateful. This young woman and her family may have got what they wanted, and they may give the monarchy a sheen of modernity. But there is little modern going on. The world of this wedding is that of a regressive culture in which women express their individuality by not wearing a hat, women are still unironically ""given away"", a good marriage is the sum of female achievement. As was made clear, and indeed taken for granted by those who should know better, we all think like this, except a few crazed republicans. The institutions of Christianity and patriarchy are unquestionable. Well, it's a wedding! Don't be grouchy. Yet there is another world out here where supreme indifference was not borne out of any hostility to the couple, rather a disdain for every convention on display. The bourgeoisie always presents its way of life as the only way to live. But there are others less stultifying. The fantasy that we may escape class, one at a time, through marriage, remains. The system on display last week is as rigid as it ever was. The acceptance of the Middletons by the monarchy was not some great moment of modernisation; it is simply a deal to ensure everything carries on as it always did. Our consent to this deal is sewn up by the continuing narrative, which assures us that every girl wants a prince. And a fairytale wedding. Whatever we say. Mindless babbling about the intricate lacework on a dress will stop us from seeing the straitjacket stitched into its structure, surely? And the conservative heart that beats within.","The Middletons were the stars of the show, but it was still a royal stitch-up | Suzanne Moore",2011-05-07T08:01:00Z,Suzanne Moore,uk
"As a certain someone once said: there's an old poster out west … actually, forgive me. There's an old poster by my desk, as I type this, for a movie that would have been at the forefront of my mind this week even were I not staring at a picture of Jimmy Stewart holding a pistol and looking rather troubled. If you haven't seen The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, then consider yourself immensely lucky, because you have the most wonderful treat ahead of you. The gazillions who know and love the John Ford classic, though, will be familiar with the story, set in a frontier town menaced by the outlaw Liberty Valance. Our principals are the grizzled cowboy John Wayne and the idealist newcomer Jimmy Stewart. A lefty lawyer beginning his political career, Stewart takes a frightful kicking from the start, but sticks with his programme of social reforms for the town – you may be on the point of spotting the analogy – working to improve education and even racial equality. Of Liberty Valance, he insists to John Wayne: ""I don't want to kill him. I just want to put him in jail."" Who'd have thunk it, then, that the person who should face down the outlaw in a duel is not John Wayne, but Jimmy Stewart. And who'd have thunk it even more that it is the bookish idealist who kills Liberty Valance with a single shot, in a piece of good fortune he can scarcely believe. Needless to say he becomes the town hero, and gets Wayne's gal. It is only subsequently that Wayne tells him that the shot that killed Valance in the so-called duel was in fact fired by him, from across the street. Not the fairest of fights, you might be thinking – but in the Duke's mind, the end justified the means. He urges Stewart to run for office and live up to the status this misattributed act has bestowed upon him – which Stewart duly does, becoming the state's first governor and then a senator. Yet weighed down by the moral compromise on which his success is based, he finally confesses all to a local newsman when he returns from Washington for John Wayne's funeral. Now he has learned the truth about Liberty Valance's death, does the reporter debunk the myth? Please. He burns his notes, uttering the immortal line: ""This is the west, sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend."" And so to Barack Obama, who will forever be The Man Who Shot Osama Bin Laden, with all the inevitable moral grey areas the title implies. Admittedly, the facts about Bin Laden's shooting have been corrected rather sooner than those concerning the death of Liberty Valance. At this rate, it will emerge by Monday that the al-Qaida chief was naked, with his hands up, and shrieking, ""Not the face! I'll tell you everything!"" when he was gunned down. But whilst it might appear that the ineptitude of the White House communications department is rivalled only by that of the Pakistani security services, those first golden hours of mythmaking have shaped the narrative that will endure in American consciousness. The legend has become fact. For my own part, despite considering myself a liberal, I must confess my tears have struggled to liquefy over the manner of the unarmed Osama's dispatch. It's not that my bleeding heart is all out of type A, nor am I summoning the cartographers, having finally discovered the outer limit of my liberal sensibilities. But it has been a while since I've had to make imperfect sense out of this type of moral muddle without the aid of West Wing creator Aaron Sorkin. This extraordinary tale really is made for Sorkin, that most brilliant poet of liberal realpolitik, in whose hands its moral complexities and compromises would stay lodged in the public consciousness far longer than the current mudslinging between the CIA, Pakistan, the military and the international lawyers could ever guarantee. Channel-hopping only a few hours before the White House announced Bin Laden's killing, I happened to stumble upon the Sorkin-scripted movie A Few Good Men, and watch for the umpteenth time Jack Nicholson's terrible bastard of a colonel deliver that horribly convincing post-moral speech about why Tom Cruise's college boy lawyer can't handle the truth. That movie ends with Colonel Jessep facing trial, quite rightly, and it is difficult to disagree in theory that the Bin Laden story should have ended in a courtroom too – though what the al-Qaida Nuremberg would look like is anyone's guess. Rather than taking place post-conflict, it would involve trying one's enemy in an information war, while that war is still ongoing. (Incidentally, can you remember a single thing from Saddam's trial? I'm ashamed to say all that sticks in my mind is the thought of the trapdoor opening at his hanging.) Indeed, as far as The Man Who Shot Osama Bin Laden goes, one can't overlook that its Liberty Valance precursor was a story about the end of frontier – the creation of civil democracy out of a land of vigilantism and wild west brute force. Given that we are supposed to live in that civil democracy today, I know it would have been better – or perhaps righter – to have brought Osama to trial. But I can also see how it was never going to work out that way. And I do hope that Aaron Sorkin is the man to create enduring cinematic magic out of that Gordian knot.",Is it OK to shoot an unarmed Osama bin Laden?

"Once David Cameron moved in the way he did,"" a senior Liberal Democrat told the Guardian on Thursday, ""the polls moved. It was unstoppable."" Well, perhaps. Certainly, along with the right-wing press, (lest we forget) the big trade unions and the more Neanderthal aspects of the Labour party, loud backing from the Tory leadership made the anti-AV camp some foe to beat. But we could also look at the defeat from another angle. The great opening up of the gap between the yes and no campaigns also coincided with the point at which senior Lib Dems decisively got involved, and tried to turn their backing for the change into a badge of difference vis-à-vis their coalition partners. I can well remember Gordon Brown's deathbed conversion to the alternative vote prompting mutterings that he was the last person you'd want to back any campaign for electoral reform, and the same surely applied to Nick Clegg, to the power of 10. As is often the case, I can do without the pompous fury of Paddy Ashdown: the Lib Dems should shoulder a lot of the blame for AV's demise, largely because they were toxic to start with, but partly because they occasionally ended up backing reform in almost as stagey and shrill a way as its opponents, and doubtless turned off thousands in the process. Chris Huhne extending Godwin's law into the campaign via his ""Goebbels"" moment springs to mind. I thought it wasn't supposed to be like this, at all. Back in November 2010, the Yes to fairer votes chair Katie Ghose said this:   ""The campaign will be completely different from anything that has gone before. We have simply got to organise from the grassroots up.""  A month later, the Guardian reported on a Downing Street press conference in which Clegg ""said that the 'Yes to fairer votes' campaign should be led by voters not politicians"", and hoped that the case for reform would be ""made particularly by people outside politics who want politicians to be made accountable to them."" The vision, as far as I could tell, was of the spirit of the ""purple people"" demo that followed last year's election result being rolled out all over the country. That happened, to a limited extent. But by the campaign's last stretch, the national stage was crowded with politicians trying to sell voters something they said would be bad news for politicians themselves, which is surely the dictionary definition of a questionable pitch. In Friday's Guardian, Timothy Garton-Ash bemoaned the yes campaign's failure to capture the public mood, and wrote this:   ""It is amazing how the anger at the dysfunctional, corrupt old politics of Westminster, which exploded in 2009 over the issue of MPs' expenses, seems to have evaporated.""  Not so, and it's precisely that lingering fury and scepticism that played some role in doing for the Yes campaign's chances: if you're trying to harness momentum for a change to the political system, you'd be well advised to keep politicians' voices to a minimum. So there we are: a fairly miserable little compromise, an equally miserable defeat, a very crafty prime minister, and arguably the greatest Lib Dem failure of all. It really is remarkable: I've just scanned the district-by-district results, and so far there are precious few parts of the UK where the yes campaign had a prayer (though hats off to Lambeth, Camden, Islington, Haringey, Glasgow Kelvin and Cambridge). Yes: AV is a preferable system to FPTP, and the usual voices were just as dastardly as you'd expect them to be, but that's really no excuse. And now there comes the redrawing of all those constituencies; to say that the Tories are currently winning is an almost cosmic understatement. And what of the future for electoral reform? Bleak, undoubtedly, though like plenty of people, my belief that so many of the failures of British politics are down to our creaking voting system remains as strong as ever. Knowing that that might be it for a lifetime, I guess people of like mind should do what should always have been done: clearly set out the goal (the single transferable vote in multimember constituencies, always the only satisfactory option) and stick to it, try to amass the right collection of voices and organisations (Eddie Izzard and Colin Firth were not it, I'd wager), understand that any convincing moves will originate well beyond Westminster, and make the arguments again, and again, and again. We all know the drill. Why are our politics eternally in thrall to a somewhat strange and very small number of people who want great public services but wince at the requisite taxes? Why no traction for urgent issues like social housing and rights at work? What are we doing privileging Mondeo man and Worcester woman? Why Milton Keynes and Harlow, but not Pontypridd and Rotherham? Why bother voting Labour in Camberley, or Tory in Llanelli? Why the tyranny of a cynically constructed centre ground that ignores just as many people on the right as it does on the left? The questions linger, and AV was never any kind of truly convincing answer, which leaves us with a simple enough story: a very British refusal to embrace a change, compounded by an equally British failure to convince people otherwise, whereby ""progressive"" forces made an array of the usual mistakes. All we can do, inevitably, is learn – which probably sounds as washed-out as I currently feel.",After the AV referendum: What next for electoral reform? | John Harris,2011-05-06T19:30:01Z,John Harris,politics

And then Dave's mobile went mad and he was shouting about the sheer awesomeness and it was even more history in the making than the wedding, with the Cobra gang crowding into the flat and everyone singing Hey Mr Taliban, with Govey on the bongos, and Obama rang and Dave went Waassup Barry, we're lovin' it, you're simply the best, Obama was literally speechless. But Farc did not get much done because after a minute's silence for the It-bag, we had to have another for Vivienne Westwood, because she may never work again after Eugenie's dress, and another minute each for all the hat victims, apparently Tara won't leave her flat, Beatrice is still heavily tranquillised, and four guests have been admitted to the Priory suffering from PTSD. Then Anya said her bags have been brought into disrepute, and Tamara went excuse me girlfriend, not as much as my shoes, and they want Philip Treacy prosecuted for inciting hatred of high-end accessories but Mummy just went his hats have always incited hatred in people of any taste, and I said I do not like to go I told you so but what more could I have done to urge extreme hat vigilance in the era of utilitarian chic than ACTUALLY NOT WEAR ONE?

"Last week, when Barack Obama released his birth certificate to silence those who had long questioned his American identity, he explained that he did not normally respond to such nonsense because ""you know, I've got other things to do"". Now we know that those ""other things"" included meticulous planning for an event that could well transform his presidency, reshaping both the way he is seen and the foreign policy he pursues. That Obama was able to announce the death of Osama bin Laden so soon after he had crushed the absurd charge that he was a foreign (maybe Kenyan, maybe Indonesian, maybe both!) usurper of the White House felt oddly appropriate. For the success of the operation in Abbottabad now makes Obama's rivals look small indeed, Lilliputians chasing wild fantasies while Gulliver deals with the things that matter. He has rendered even more laughable Donald Trump's declaration that ""I feel proud of myself"" for flushing out the proof of Obama's Hawaiian birth. The president has shown what a true achievement looks like. For, like it or not, no trophy mattered more to American public opinion. As the perpetrator of the most lethal terrorist attack on US soil, Bin Laden was a national hate figure, loathed far more viscerally than, say, Saddam Hussein. That's why his death brought spontaneous midnight crowds to Times Square and Pennsylvania Avenue – a response that never greeted the capture of Saddam. One US commentator described Sunday night as feeling like VE Day. Obama's role in slaying the dragon may not make him a national hero, but it will take a special kind of stupidity for Republicans to question his patriotism now. The killing in Pakistan will bury another criticism, rarely articulated explicitly: the suggestion that Obama was somehow insufficiently tough, insufficiently macho, to be America's commander-in-chief. It was there in the mockery of his taste for ""arugula"", the repeated descriptions of him as ""professorial"". A former speechwriter for Mario Cuomo, the hardball ex-governor of New York, once told me: ""There is a subtext of male violence that runs through American politics."" He reckoned male voters especially want to believe the president could take a guy out if needed, that he is capable of aggression. This partly explains the rapturous response that greeted Obama's merciless slapdown of Trump during his stand-up at the White House correspondents' dinner on Saturday night. Americans need to know their president has steel. Crude though it may be, Obama just passed that test with flying colours of red, white and blue. He did it, though, his own way. The tenor of his televised announcement was revealing. Yes, he was keen to take full credit: speaking of his own involvement and decision-making over several long months, lest anyone think this was the work of underlings or a drone that got lucky. But he avoided the crass cowboy talk that was a hallmark of the previous administration: the official statement of Saddam's capture began with the words ""We got him"". Obama's style was, by contrast, measured and steady, recalling 9/11 and speaking movingly of the images of ""that September day"" that the world did not see, starting with ""The empty seat at the dinner table"". From now on Obama will be viewed slightly differently at home and abroad, his coolness understood to be unflappable and poker-faced, rather than chilly and professorial. One former foreign minister who has seen the president up close believes that Bin Laden's scalp will lead other world leaders to conclude that, to paraphrase Teddy Roosevelt, ""Obama may speak softly – but he carries a big stick"". Expect the comparisons with Jimmy Carter – whose own raid to rescue US hostages in Tehran famously failed – to dry up pretty quickly. All this augurs well for Obama's re-election prospects in 2012, though of course 18 months is a long time in anybody's politics. If there should be another spectacular attack on a US target, conducted to avenge Bin Laden's death, then the current euphoria will melt away. Besides, next year's campaign is likely to hinge on the economy rather than security. But for now at least, the killing of the world's most wanted man presents the president with an important opportunity. Obama's greatest non-domestic headache remains the war in Afghanistan. One well-informed source says that, until Sunday, Obama was ""hemmed in"", especially by a military brass reluctant to walk away with anything that did not look like victory. The immediate argument in Washington centred on the number of troops scheduled for withdrawal starting 1 July, the military speaking only of a ""symbolic"" figure, the White House wanting more. In that dispute, Obama's hand is now strengthened, with public opinion likely to shift decisively his way. That's because, for a lot of Americans, the purpose of the US war in Afghanistan remains inseparably linked to its initial cause: 9/11. Now that the arch-perpetrator of that crime has been removed, why, many Americans will ask, do we need to stay? This may not fit with the highfalutin logic of the geopolitics crowd, but that is how much of US public opinion will see it. Obama could, however, do more than simply insist on greater numbers of US troops coming home. He could use Bin Laden's death to shift towards a full exit strategy, seeking what is surely the only credible solution: a peace settlement that holds both inside Afghanistan, necessarily including the Taliban, and outside, necessarily including Pakistan, whose own role in harbouring Bin Laden – unwitting or not – will cause many Americans to wonder if that country is actually friend or foe in the war against al-Qaida. There are risks for Obama. If he does not act quickly, he could find public opinion gets ahead of him – as impatience over the decade-long Afghan war turns into impatience with the president for not winding it down. For now, though, he has scored a valuable victory, one that lifts his own standing but also arrests the gloomy, declinist mood that has gripped some in his country, convinced that American power is on the slide. He has done in two years what his predecessor failed to do in eight. But Bush's ""Mission Accomplished"" banner should stay in the White House basement: al-Qaida remains, the war in Afghanistan is not over, and there is still so much more work to do.",Obama's rivals now look like Lilliputians to his Gulliver | Jonathan Freedland,2011-05-02T20:05:00Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"We shed no tears for Osama bin Laden. The most outrageous act of terrorism in modern times has led to the most gigantic manhunt and most costly tit-for-tat war. America's joy, as much of relief as of delight, is understandable. But the thesis must now be put to the test, whether an idea is more potent when its creator has died for it than when he was alive. Killing Bin Laden removes Bin Laden, but not al-Qaida or its cause. It will not end his franchise on jihadism. We must assume a furious bout of retaliation from those prepared to die in his name. The challenge now is not for the Muslim world but for the west. Can the clock be stopped on the ""wars of 9/11""? Can time be called on this rerun of the medieval crusades, America's (and Britain's) massive retaliation? Can the craving for revenge that fuelled the US's astonishing 10 years of war against weak but curiously potent foes at last abate? I recall the Afghan diplomat who told me in the weeks between 9/11 and the assault on Kabul of October 2001 that, provided the west did not go to war against Afghanistan, ""Bin Laden is dead"". A Pashtun loya jirga in Kandahar that September had come near to demanding that Mullah Omar expel Bin Laden and his Arabs. The view of observers was that opinion was moving against Omar's indulgence of them. Above all, al-Qaida's murder of the Tajik hero Ahmad Shah Massoud two days before 9/11, meant that every loyal Tajik wanted Bin Laden's blood. He and his hated Arabs had become ""unwelcome guests"" in Afghanistan, and had now undermined a mild Taliban rapprochement with its old friends in Washington's CIA. Leave Kabul alone, my informant said, raise the blood money and Bin Laden's days were numbered. Above all, make sure the Taliban are not driven into the arms of al-Qaida, or Bin Laden the reckless menace will become Bin Laden the saint. This advice was widely disseminated, but gained no hearing. The hysteria of revenge was overwhelming and the drums of war deafening. Who knows how many tens of thousands of Afghans died, and are still dying, to avenge Bin Laden? There can be no computation of the billions of dollars blown on the project, nearly bankrupting the US government. The Taliban were duly punished and the west trapped in ill-conceived ""nation-building"" in Afghanistan. American and British governments were so besotted by terrorism that they persuaded themselves of a new and fanciful threat from a wholly unrelated Muslim state, Iraq. Yet more thousands of Muslims died and billions were spent in the process. The west thus entered the 21st century massively ignoring Eisenhower's warning of what happens when too much power is vested in the military-industrial complex. Soldiers demanded ""surges"" and politicians capitulated. The continued drone bombing of Pakistani villages – starkly counter-productive, say the WikiLeaks revelations – shows there is nothing more lethal to peace than a general out of control with a new piece of kit. To what end? A few nasty guys have gone, in a world awash with them, and the west has lost its peace dividend. Britain, the US and western values in general have not emerged from a decade of conflict with their reputations enhanced, quite the reverse. A new centre of regional instability has been created in Pakistan, where it is clear that the military was sheltering Bin Laden. There is no ""conquest"" of the Taliban to be had, as there never has been in history. There is only a deal between the tribes and warlords of this troubled land, under the aegis of the neighbouring Pakistani state. It is America that has been al-Qaida's recruiting sergeant in the region. There are many well-meaning people in Britain who supported the Afghan war. They felt, out of some vague post-imperial guilt, that it was the west's ""manifest destiny"" to punish wrong-doing wherever it could, and to aid political and economic progress in the Muslim world. Even they must now wonder whether the game was worth the candle, whether the resources expended on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq might have achieved their goals more peaceably. Westerners cannot begin to comprehend the devastation their armies and bombers have inflicted on poor people who have the flimsiest of political and economic structures to survive them. The idea that the Afghan people can sensibly ""choose"" between the west and the Taliban is nonsense. All they want is peace, and all the west has brought them is war. It will take decades for the wounds to heal, and they will never be healed by western arms. The test for Washington and London in the aftermath of Bin Laden's demise is to recapture some strategic initiative, so as to meet the declared policy of a steady withdrawal from the Afghan theatre. This will require supreme restraint in reacting to whatever is the response of militant Islam to Bin Laden's death. There is one obstacle to this. Supreme restraint is a phrase markedly absent from the lexicon of western diplomacy towards the Muslim world.",Osama bin Laden is dead – but not al-Qaida or its cause | Simon Jenkins,2011-05-02T19:44:00Z,Simon Jenkins,world
"It was a feelgood day. The women who served me in the Co-op wore their special outfits. And to watch an attractive woman in a beautiful dress pledging her troth to a handsome man in a great abbey is a sumptuous sight. The Church of England was one unexpected and unambiguous winner – the bishop of London managed an address that combined due gravity, spirituality and hope. It was a reminder of this curious institution's importance to the nation. I was less certain about the royal family. The two princes looked so much like Diana's boys: it was only 30 years ago that she was doing the same as Kate Middleton. You wondered what must have been going on in Prince William's mind as his first act as a married man was to bow both to his grandmother, and to Camilla, his mother's nemesis, now occupying the place his mother would have cherished. Of course that is part of the royal family's point: to be the longest-running and glitziest soap on the planet – and this wedding was another classic episode: the gallery of medieval-style trumpeters made me laugh out loud, but at other times the effect was touching and affecting . Commentary is thus made infinitely harder: apart from the queen, no royal warrants any real reverence, so attempts to be serious collapse into unctuous banality. Simon Schama's comment to the BBC's Huw Edwards that there were three marriages going on – between Kate and William, past and future, and monarchy and nation – for my money won the prize. There was only one marriage; given the soap the Windsors have become, to suggest that the event represented more was unhinged. The Lancaster bomber and Spitfire flew over the BMW-owned Rolls-Royces and Volkswagen-made ""useful"" buses ferrying the minor royals around. The best the Brits could do was the dress. The fall from industrial grace from when Elizabeth got married in 1947 could hardly have been starker. There is, of course, an umbilical link between the flummery, sycophancy and empty titles and our ongoing economic sclerosis. Britain is not a society likely to produce either the next Google or another Rolls-Royce. But we do a good royal wedding.","The British economy might be sclerotic, but at least we can still do a good royal wedding",2011-04-30T16:00:02Z,Will Hutton,uk
"There were no trees inside St Paul's in 1981. The press assembled well before kick-off. We were innocents then, of the present as well as the future. The bride's bulimia (an episode the previous night), the bridegroom's mistress: how could we have known, what gave us the right to know? It was a beautiful day in late July. Nobody could have guessed that the marriage we were witnessing would plant the seeds of monarchy's near destruction. ""Lovely, lovely, lovely,"" the Washington Post reported next day in a severe case of adjectival exhaustion. ""Lovely, lovely, lovely."" About 750 million people watched. For a day, all was right with the world. The cathedral's dean, the Very Reverend Alan Webster, addressed us: ""Can you see at the back? Now if you have time to sing, do sing because the hymns have been chosen by the prince and not by clergymen and it's almost your duty to sing."" I don't think many of us sang – the invitation made us as sullen and awkward as an infant class – but an exception was certainly Jean Rook, the woman then billed in the Daily Express as the First Lady of Fleet Street. She stood in the pew behind and gave it her all, like Dame Clara Butt. The national anthem had been given a flashy arrangement by David Willcocks. I wrote at the time that it was like listening to the opposite of freeform jazz, where ""one realises with a deepening sense of loss that the saxophonist has left the melody behind and intends to mess about fruitlessly for the next 20 minutes""; that in this case, no matter how complicated the introduction, the tune would arrive in all its dreariness. The Sunday Times editor, Frank Giles, objected: ""I think it's a jolly good tune."" But he let the remark stand – he was (and so far as I know still is) a nice, elegant man of a kind you hardly ever see any more. A former diplomat, he'd served in the Moscow embassy in Stalin's day. Looking up his details now, I see he was 20 when the second war broke out, which may have made a difference to how he heard the tune. We tend to forget this fact of 30 years ago – that the crowds who came to cheer contained so many people who had once seen Lancasters and Spitfires as familiar objects. Aged 50, you would remember the war. Aged 60, you might have fought in it. As dawn broke over the Mall, young gangs could be heard chanting like football fans, ""Lady Di, Lady Di, Lady Di"". That seemed like a new kind of British behaviour, ribald and self-mocking. ""The line between a joke patriot and a real patriot,"" as the Spectator wrote, ""having grown fainter and finally disappeared."" But when the sun rose higher, an older generation came out to sweeten the atmosphere. I heard Maybe It's Because I'm a Londoner and Blaydon Races, neither of them sung within the quotation marks of irony. The singers knew the words. I wrote that it was as if I'd fallen down a magical well into a country peopled by Stanley Holloway, Will Hay and the Crazy Gang. In 1981, that country wasn't really so far away. British pits still employed a quarter of a million miners, ships stills went down the slipways of several dozen British shipyards, the Rolls-Royces that purred to the front door of St Paul's still had British engines. We took the most extraordinary things for granted. When Charles and Diana left on their honeymoon they went by special train – one just for them – from Waterloo to Romsey in Hampshire, where they spent three days at the Mountbatten house. Next they flew to Gibraltar to join the royal yacht Britannia for a Mediterranean cruise, with a marine band aboard and nearly 250 officers and crew, the crew as usual in plimsolls so as not disturb the royal rest. Again, just for them. Did I mind? Did anyone mind? Did the Guardian scowl? I don't remember that we did. (For myself, I loved the Britannia – beautiful lines, built in Clydebank – and nearly cried when in 1997 I went to see her leave the Pool of London on her final voyage.) Republicanism came out to play and threatened nothing. A few of my friends joined an anti-wedding excursion to France, where they drank lots of wine and handed out leaflets to bemused people in Boulogne. ""La classe ouvrière"" in Britain was finding it hard to make ends meet, these leaflets said, while at the same ""une somme enorme"" was being spent on the nuptials of an obscure naval officer and a rich debutante. If anything, this rather understated the position. Imprisoned IRA men were dying on hunger strike, urban rioting had erupted in several English cities, 2.5 million people (and rising) were on the dole. But at my local Funk the Wedding festival – how polite we were then – a poster saying ""Let them eat fishfingers"" was the nearest we got to the guillotine. No change there, you may feel, but at least the temperament of the royal crowd seems different. I walked along the Mall this Thursday. The phrase ""media event"" doesn't quite capture what was going on. The spectators camped in their tents were certainly there to watch the pageantry, but they were also aware that they existed to be talked to, filmed and photographed. So there was one group, immobile with their flags and funny hats at the fence, and a constant procession of people behind them holding notebooks and cameras. ""Have you come far?"" ""Are you enjoying yourself?"" ""All the way from San Diego, really!"" We sounded just like the Queen. In other words, the crowd was there to see and be seen. A jolly bunch of women singing Get Me to the Church on Time had the words in front of them, and tended to stop when the cameras turned off. No need to sneak up on them like Cartier-Bresson. The modern crowd knows its importance as an actor. Whose death explained it to them? I give you the nervous, unknowing girl at St Paul's 30 years ago. ""Lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely"" (Washington Post).","Royal wedding then, and now | Ian Jack",2011-04-30T06:00:00Z,Ian Jack,uk
"Relax. It is not important. The dress is not important. The bouquet is not important. Whether the hair is up or down is not important. The guest list is fine but for some silly hitches. The royal wedding tells us nothing about the state of the monarchy, the fate of the government, the class system, or the habits and morals of the young. Its global fascination lies in its re-enactment of the princess myth, of commoner marrying warrior prince. For all but the desperately glum, it is the apotheosis of public celebration – and much cheaper than the Olympics.     Illustration by Satoshi Kambayashi    That said, you could have fooled me. The tosh poured from the media these past few weeks has tested to breaking point the laws of demand and supply for journalism. Kate Middleton's choice of dress may be of absorbing interest to some, but that it indicates (in the Daily Telegraph) a monarchy choosing between ""a link to the past, or upper-middle-class safety, or fiercely up-to-date"" is beyond me. How the bride wears her hair can apparently hold the attention of 300 million women worldwide, but it cannot seriously suggest partiality or otherwise to the coalition. There may be good reasons for the Middletons to arrive at the Abbey by internal combustion engine rather than horse, but this is hardly, as alleged, a snub to the Green party. As for the cake, the gastrointestinal pundit, Amanda Foreman, opines that the addition of a chocolate-biscuit version to the customary fruitcake indicates that royal couple are ""comfortable in themselves"". Indeed ""because of it [the chocolate biscuit] they are going to shape the monarchy in ways that will bring life and vigour to that institution"". If Britain's monarchy is susceptible to a biscuit, Foreman must know more about its ingredients than I do. The global brain clearly has trouble dissociating the fascination of a happening from its significance, or otherwise. Confusion has certainly been sown by the wedding being attended, unwisely, by so many of the pseudo-trappings of statehood, such as the attendance of dotty foreign monarchs and dodgy ambassadors. This was bound to pollute a family occasion with political controversy, and so it has done. Whoever thought the occasion suitable to the diplomatic corps should be fired. William is not a serving monarch but a serving junior air force officer. The wedding of the second in line to the throne would ""matter"" only if the British crown carried power or influence over the lives of British citizens and if, in addition, there was an acute shortage of candidates for the job. Neither is the case. The Queen and the Prince of Wales are in rude health. The impotence of the crown has been established for three centuries, and there are dozens in line to the throne. So why has the BBC found 550 otherwise unemployed staff to work on up 10 hours of wedding coverage? Why is NBC flying over its entire anchor team? Why has the editor of Majesty magazine gone back to smoking? Why is Oprah Winfrey reduced to interviewing a village publican acquainted with the bride's father on whether he has tasted a pint of wedding ale? Have none of them read Coke, Bagehot and Dicey on the constitutional role of parliament? Have they all got it plain wrong? The answer seems to be yes. Everyone – including wedding-hating republicans – has been sucked into a constitutional confidence trick, that Britain's tradition of anthropomorphising the state in the body of a person depends on who that person is, that it depends in some sense on the merit of the holder. It does not. It depends on the continuity of the blood line, that's all. The tradition is robust precisely because merit is irrelevant. There are many ways in which nations dress themselves for the ceremonies of statehood. Blessed with a rare national continuity, England – in collusion with its Celtic neighbours and some Commonwealth adjuncts – retains a hereditary monarch as figurehead, largely because it has circumvented the normal processes by which consent to rule disposes of autocrats: usually revolution and decapitation. When they did apply, in the 17th century, the republican option proved so unappealing that the nation reverted to monarchy, even to the appalling Stuarts. Constitutional scholars and dyed-in-the-wool republicans still go to great lengths to detect chinks of discretion and therefore significance in the office of monarch, declaring it unacceptable in a modern democracy. Their task is assisted by the lack of a properly codified constitution that might lay the monarchical ghost once and for all. But while the office clearly has a ""role"", as in opening parliament, heading the Church of England and getting married in Westminster Abbey, it has no authority over the government of the country. If it did, it would soon cease to exist, as was threatened during the last real monarchical crisis, over parliamentary reform in 1910. The only requirement of the monarch is to perform public duties as formal head of state – in other words, to be a human being and look good on the night. If there were any question of merit, it would imply that there was some role for which merit was a criterion, which is why the gender or faith of the monarch should no longer be an issue. The virtue of heredity in selecting this person is solely that it is simple, and brooks no argument. When there has been argument, as when Edward VIII appeared unacceptable as king in 1936, he was briskly and unceremoniously bundled from office. Monarchy is no more than a constitutional device, a vehicle for the dignities of statehood. That is why the royal wedding cannot hope to bear the crushing weight of meaning heaped upon it. We are not witnessing the marriage of Henry V of England to Catherine of France, nor even of a monarch or a soon to be monarch. Only an obsessive could detect in the coupling of William and Kate some breathtaking leap across a divide of income or class. We are certainly getting a lesson in the power of global celebrity, but we get those every day. As for the dress, hair, coach and cake, they tell us no more about modern monarchy than Susan Boyle's voice tells us about modern musicology. Hence the royal wedding can be enjoyed precisely because it is unimportant, because it lurches close to Ruritania out of Barbara Cartland without quite touching them, without losing contact with authenticity. The American networks may scream that the prince is just two heartbeats from ruling 60 million people, but they know this is nonsense. The Anglican marriage service, to do it justice, has little of the aloof formality of more orthodox faiths, or of the ""arranged"" nuptials of some cultures. It allows spectators to witness the happiness and hopes of two young people embarking on an intimate journey of uncertain outcome. The concept of public romance may seem voyeuristic and the context antiquely sexist. But there is no point in denying the reason why the world's eyes are fastened on London today. It is because an attractive young woman has achieved the apogee of female romanticism since the days of King Arthur. She has found herself a real live prince.

"I spent much of last week being a Palestinian. And not just any Palestinian. I was the man charged with negotiating their future. Over the course of two full days I was Saeb Erekat, longtime (and now caretaker) negotiations chief of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, facing off against an Israeli team led by one of Binyamin Netanyahu's closest confidants. Behind closed doors, and under the watchful eye of Barack Obama's handpicked envoy, George Mitchell, we argued and haggled over the knottiest issues of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict – seeking to find common ground on questions of rights, refugees and recognition as well as security and sovereignty. I succeeded in extracting from the Israelis an acceptance that the states of Palestine and Israel will be separated by a border reflecting the 1967 lines, more or less, and that Jerusalem will serve as the capital of both nations. Which I considered a rather good week's work. Strictly speaking, the names above should all come wrapped in quotation marks. For I was playing the role of Erekat in an elaborate simulation game – alongside a dozen or so people whose professional lives are steeped in the conflict, whether as diplomats, NGO officials, scholars or journalists, from both inside and outside the region. Participants were asked to step outside their comfort zone. We were under Chatham House rules – so no names I'm afraid – but I can tell you that my fellow ""Palestinian"" negotiators included an Israeli citizen who is a full-time advocate for his country, a senior official of a pro-Israel charity, and a top figure from the Jewish Chronicle. Representing Israel were two Palestinians – one a citizen of the US, the other a citizen of Israel – and two luminaries of London-based NGOs with long experience of the occupied territories. Crucially, both teams could call on coaches – one Israeli, one Palestinian – who had served as negotiators at high-level peace talks. Holding the ring was a serving European diplomat whom we all had to address as Senator Mitchell. The scheme is the brainchild of an American academic, Natasha Gill, who calls it ""Track 4"" to distinguish it from the three more conventional tracks of diplomacy: those involving government-to-government talks, civil society, or people-to-people encounters. Her aim is not to have a ""peacenik lovefest"", in which each side learns to empathise with the other, but rather to understand the dynamics, and difficulties, of the negotiations themselves. I admit I had deep fears, starting with a dread of embarrassment – speaking as one for whom the words ""role play"" are second only to ""audience participation"" in their ability to chill the blood. So what happened once we were in the room? Attached to the track dealing with rights and recognition, I found myself intransigent in defending the right of Palestinian refugees from 1948 to return to their homes in what is now Israel. What is more, my colleagues and I gave short shrift to the ""Israeli"" delegation's protestations of sorrow for the refugees' plight that came attached to a refusal to take any responsibility for it. My team-mate – whose day job has him pushing Israel's case around the clock – accused one ""Israeli"" interlocutor of failing to understand the nature of Palestinian identity, half-forgetting that she was, in fact, Palestinian. When the ""Israelis"" repeatedly insisted that we recognise Israel as a Jewish state, our irritation rose further. No such demand had been made for past peace agreements: to demand it now was surely a wrecking tactic. Our vehemence seemed to pay off. When it came to drafting a US text, ""Mitchell"" produced a document giving us much that we wanted, starting with those 1967 lines and Jerusalem. The Israelis put up some resistance, but buckled on those two key points. I would like to tell you that this was a product of our canny negotiating skills, but I can't. Apparently, this is how it almost always turns out. Gill has noticed a repeating pattern. No matter whom she casts as the Palestinian delegation, they fast become impassioned and eloquent, full of righteous indignation. ""Even pro-Israel Zionists become angry Palestinians,"" she says. Conversely, she adds, the Israeli teams often struggle, giving away too much too quickly. Even when they strain hard, they become moderates at best. Some cynics will suspect that reveals the inherent bias of those who have acted as Israelis in Track 4: they're so pro-Palestinian, they can't put themselves in Israeli shoes. But Gill locates the explanation in the nature of the competing claims. The ""Palestinians"" walk into the room regarding themselves as the aggrieved, injured party. They are the underdog, the occupied people, and that gives them the immediate moral high ground. The Israelis have a narrative involving dispossession and suffering too, but it tends to relate to the past, even if it is the relatively recent past. They are unavoidably cast as the stronger party, the one that wants to hold on to what it has, the one that has to say no. What is more, the ""Israelis"" soon realise that their cards consist of tangible assets – starting with land – which they are being asked to give up for abstract declarations – on, for example, recognition of Israel – from people they hardly trust. This mismatch eventually feeds their resentment and makes them dig in their heels. These were valuable lessons in themselves, but the exercise taught something much deeper. Within hours, I noticed that I was becoming fixated on scoring points rather than solving problems. I had a troublesome member of the delegation, constantly positioning himself as more radical, more faithful to the cause – reminding me of the political price I would pay if I compromised too much. This constrained me. I also realised that the key audience was not really the Israelis across the table – it was the Americans at the head that mattered. It was their text I wanted to influence. In this context, the omission of some phrase the Israelis wanted counted as a victory: it made more sense to avoid an issue than to solve it. If this is how I behaved after less than 24 hours, no wonder the two sides act the way they do. Gradually I became aware of the enormous gulf that separates those of us who view the conflict from afar – whether from our perch on liberal newspapers or in well-meaning thinktanks – from those who have actually to solve the problem. From this distance, the solution might seem painfully obvious: any cool-headed moderate can see where the midpoint between the two sides lies. But that is to reckon without the pressures on the negotiators within their own team, from a public opinion always ready to cry sell-out, and from the US. And that's even before you get to the demands of the other side. Gill dreams of creating a ""community of shadow negotiators"" – people around the world who understand not the narrative of the other so much as the predicament of the peacemakers themselves. It is a noble aim, one that would serve as a corrective to the  armies of outsiders whose current contribution is simply to fuel the anger of the two sides, rather than to find a way out – inflaming grievances rather than finding solutions. What's needed are people who understand the price that has to be paid and who are ready to support it. Those apart from this conflict who claim to care about one or both peoples should take note. There is no shortage of friends of the Israelis or advocates of the Palestinians. What's missing are friends of peace itself.",Israel and Palestine don't need more friends –  but the peace process does | Jonathan Freedland,2011-04-20T06:30:00Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"A bad omen is at hand. The cult of the ruin is back. I mean not just the return of such modern ""ruins"" as the Great Depression, Liberal coalitions or royal weddings, but ancient ones too. Television is furiously walking, digging and rescuing relics of the past. The British Museum recalls the venues of wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and, perhaps, whatever the RAF leaves standing of Libya. Meanwhile, publishers are chiselling ever more tomes from the walls of castles and abbeys. No self-respecting coffee table is without a leg-buckling volume of ruination. The architectural writers Jeremy Musson and John Goodall are the latest priests of the cult to celebrate its mysteries. Musson's English Ruins exults in such shrines as Glastonbury, Fountains, Dunstanburgh, Bodiam, Cowdray and even Battersea power station. England to him ""is a landscape of ruins"". Not a town is without some clump of tumbled stone, telling of ""the rise and fall of dynasties … of great follies and long-forgotten certainties"". It does not matter if the original is a Norman keep or the boarded-up houses of Yvette Cooper's ""Pathfinder"" northern ghost towns. They are grist to Musson's mill of fossilised history. John Goodall has produced a majestic survey, The English Castle, from the mottes of William the Conqueror to the follies of the Stuarts; from the Tower of London to the effete fantasies of Hardwick and Bolsover. To Goodall the castle is a symbol of an ancient aristocracy that saw fortification as not just security but ""central to the character of residence and social identity"". While on the continent castles continued fit for purpose into the 19th century, in England they had mostly followed monasteries into collapse by the middle of the 17th. England thus started early on ruination. It bequeathed the Georgians an astonishing collection of gaunt and gutted structures, ready for the Romantics to swoon over and the ministry of works to grasp to its bosom and timidly surround with nationalised grass. While old cathedrals and churches were vigorously restored by the Victorians, to be repaired and updated ever since, most abbeys and castles were frozen in time. They were for the delight of scholars, but their mounds of stone were largely meaningless to the public. England's ruins are a collective memorial to the unknown archaeologist. Since both authors are acolytes of the cult, neither dares challenge this state of affairs, though Musson hints that ""ruins may yet have a future of revival and new purpose"". He does not elaborate on what we should do with them. There must be tens of thousands of wrecked properties in England, fixed in the ""untouchability"" convention of the mid-20th century.Are they to remain unvisited by restoration or reuse for all time? When a modern building is blasted by bombs or gutted by fire it is restored, give or take help from the insurers. It is not seized by English Heritage and declared ruinous for ever. Some have luckily escaped the frigid grasp, as when Hampton Court, Windsor and Castle Howard were ravaged by fire and restored before anyone could declare them a ruin. Bury St Edmunds Cathedral was even given a new gothic tower for the millennium. Most medieval buildings leave us numb. We take one look and reach for the rule book. Masonry and rubble must be ""stabilised"". Puddles of mortar are all that may indicate the location of naves, cloisters and towers. Around everything should be mown grass, its edges three inches from any stonework. All seem the same, with the same bareness, the same notices, the same lawns, the same health-and-safety railings. Goodall's castles and Musson's abbeys are rendered soulless, their past and their purpose evoked only in artist's impressions. The unschooled imagination must be stirred by wind, trees, surrounding fields and cawing rooks. England's past is rented out to spooks and necromancers. To the more confident Victorians, ruins had none of today's cold ideology. They studied the past not as relic-worshippers and object fetishists but to stimulate the present. They restored medieval buildings, where they could, for reuse. Infused with the boldness and sense of drama of the middle ages, they adapted ruins to adorn the most go-ahead civilisation on earth and imitated its style to their glory. To the Victorians, modern architecture meant Big Ben, St Pancras, Manchester town hall, Cardiff Castle and a new Westminster Abbey. Nor was this confidence confined to England. Most of ""medieval"" Europe is a 19th-century restoration, and much that is ""ruined"" is reconstructed, from Mussolini's Agrigento to Rose Macaulay's Palmyra and its ""golden ochre colonnades … of broken daffodils"". From the Sainte Chapelle to Gaudí's Barcelona, from the Kremlin to Carcasonne, from Cologne Cathedral to Ottawa's parliament, 19th-century architects gloried in the medieval past and adopted it for a no less glorious future. Having wandered most of the ruins described by Goodall and Musson I have no doubt of the care with which they are protected. Compared with the degeneration often seen in France and especially Italy, where Pompeii is a disaster area, we can be thankful we have the expertise and money to guard what survives. But we seem to have exhausted all imagination in what to do with them. There are glimmerings of a new approach in English Heritage's bold reconstruction of the Dover Castle interiors. But for the most part English ruins are stuck in a marriage of scholarship and postwar bureaucracy circa 1950. There are obviously national icons whose character derives from their ruined state, such as Fountains Abbey, Tintern and Chepstow. But most castles could be treated as the Victorians treated Arundel, Belvoir and Alnwick, by reinstating their interiors for modern use. We do not leave disused railway stations or barracks or dockyards to ruination. We do not refuse to repair churches so as to create new ruins. What is so special with castles that we leave Stokesay, Cowdray and Portchester gaunt and empty? I cannot see what ideological hang-up there is in not rebuilding England's greatest ruined mansion, Witley Court in Worcestershire, gutted by fire in 1937 and ""stabilised"" as a ruin in 1972. We restored Uppark, gutted likewise in 1989. If Athens can rebuild the Stoa of Attalus under the Acropolis, we can surely rebuild Housesteads Fort on Hadrian's Wall, or Lullingstone Roman villa in Kent, currently buried inside what looks like a municipal swimming pool. The cult of the ruin is a strange concoction of the Georgian imagination, sanctified by a mix of Horace Walpole, JMW Turner and Bram Stoker's Dracula. Yet the Romantics were celebrating not static humps of stone but active decay, the return of old buildings to the soil from which they sprung. They even built new ruins to evoke respect for the passing follies of mankind. Today this warped romanticism has become modernist nonsense, that anything old must be left untouched, and anything new may not refer to it or it will be ""pastiche"". It is a deathly liturgy of scholarly infallibility. We have ruins and to spare. We would give them more meaning and more presence in the landscape by bringing them to life as useful buildings.",This cult of the ruin renders England's landscape soulless.

"The pendulum is getting a bit creaky. There was a time, back in the 60s and 70s, when it seemed to swing with metronomic regularity, power alternating between Labour and the Tories at roughly five-yearly intervals. Since 1979 though, the tempo has slowed drastically. The Conservatives held office for 18 years before the pendulum swung back to Labour, only for Labour to stay put for 13 years after that, narrowly dislodged by a vote that forced the Tories into coalition. This is about more than the passage of time. There is a narrative to this cycle too – one that contains both danger and opportunity for the politicians. Each of the two main parties pushes one half of this narrative while rejecting the other. Put together, this is the story they tell. Conservative governments come in to clear up the economic mess left by Labour; Labour then repairs the social damage left by the Tories. Take 1979, when Margaret Thatcher arrived to end a dysfunctional decade that had culminated in Labour's winter of discontent. According to the narrative, Thatcherism resuscitated the economy – but at a devastating social cost. By 1997 the public realm was so badly run down that it needed Labour to mend the torn social fabric of the country – to build the schools and hospitals that had been so badly neglected. But in the process Labour wrecked the economy again, leaving an economic mess in 2010 that had to be cleared up by the Tories. And round and round it goes: Labour ruin the finances, the Conservatives ruin the fabric and each has to come in to repair the damage caused by the other. Call it the pendulum narrative. It's rarely set out like that because both main parties, while happy to dish out the blame, dislike taking it. But it informs, even dominates, their thinking. George Osborne used to declare that Labour governments always end the same way – the economy in tatters, drenched in red ink – and the coalition has not tired of that refrain. Indeed, it pushes it daily, with relentless discipline. Clegg was at it again on Tuesday, telling the one-time ""bigoted woman"" Gillian Duffy in Rochdale: ""We've got to sort out the mess that we inherited from the previous lot."" I'm sure that if the toast burns in the Clegg household, even the kids know it was Gordon Brown, not Papa, who burned it. But the other half of the story holds great peril for the government. The decision to eliminate the deficit within a single parliament has led to a programme of cuts that seems designed to prove the pendulum narrative – in which Tory-led governments end up trashing the social landscape – ahead of schedule. Usually, one former Downing Street adviser notes, it's towards the end of a government's life that it reverts to type. This time, he says, ""the Tories are doing it from day one,"" closing libraries and Sure Start centres, cutting educational allowances and slashing arts budgets – shrinking and shrivelling the public realm. Now Labour can throw Osborne's taunt back at him. This is how Tory governments always end – and how they begin, too. Of course this is not how David Cameron would have planned it. He would have liked to have mirrored New Labour's initial approach to governing. Determined to exorcise the old ghosts, Brown and Blair arrived in 1997 wearing voluntary hair shirts, sticking for two years to Tory spending limits, diverting any excess cash into paying down the national debt. Prudence was designed to dispel the old Labour identification with Profligacy. The Cameron equivalent would have been two years of compassionate conservatism, largesse directed at teachers and nurses designed to bury the Tories' status as the nasty party. But the decision to focus monomaniacally on the deficit has denied them that option. Instead all that painstaking work on brand decontamination has been discarded as the Tories in government return to traditional form and wield the axe. What can they do about it? How can they avoid leaving such social devastation that they speed up the usual cycle, hastening their 1997 moment – the day when the country turns to Labour to restore the battered public sphere? Both coalition partners are already thinking about that, looking ahead to the second half of the parliament when, they hope, the painful work of deficit reduction will be nearly done and there will be some room for manoeuvre. In 2012 Lib Dems and Tories will renegotiate their coalition agreement – ""renew their vows"" is how one coalition insider puts it – with a view to ending their five-year term on a higher note, talking about regional investment, tax reform or the pupil premium, rather than slash and burn. Danny Alexander and Oliver Letwin are leading the advance thinking on ""mid-term and beyond"" and have, I'm told, already made one presentation on the topic to Cameron and Clegg. Lib Dems hope the model will be their work on social mobility – which, they boast, has proper mechanisms to ensure, and yardsticks to measure, progress – rather than the Tories' pet project, the ""big society"". ""How will we know in 2015 if society has got bigger?"" mocks a well-placed source. The challenge set by the pendulum narrative for the coalition is clear enough: they must persuade the public they have repaired the economy without wrecking society. But it leaves Labour with a weighty task, too. It has to break the assumption that it ruined the public finances and so cannot be trusted with the economy. How to do that is the subject of vigorous debate at the highest levels of the party. There are some we'd once have called Blairites who believe the only answer is a full mea culpa. Labour should admit it messed up, they say; only then will the party gain a public hearing. Others say that would be suicidal, that once you've confessed to driving the car into the ditch no one will give you the keys again. Even if – especially if – economic times are tough, they won't be allowed anywhere near power. The other view, which so far is prevailing, concedes a limited apology for regulating the banks too lightly but no more. That's sensible, and fits with the facts. It's not Labour profligacy that caused the deficit – if the last government was spending too much why did the Tories promise, until summer 2008, to match its largesse? What's more, the books on the nation's current account were set to balance over the cycle before the crash hit. As David Miliband used to put it, this was a problem caused ""on Wall Street, not Downing Street"". Labour needs to become as tireless at making this case as the coalition is at repeating, ad nauseam, that it ""inherited this mess"". Only then can Labour hope to disrupt the pattern that, if the past is any guide, would keep them out of office for a generation. There is another possibility. That the current wave of economic bad news – with the latest retail sales the lowest since records began in 1996 , along with rock-bottom consumer confidence – persists and gets worse. In which case the coalition will have swung the pendulum both ways, ruining both the economy and society in a single term. If that happens the coalition partners won't be renewing their vows but saying the last rites.",The pendulum will swing from Tory axe to Labour spending.

"When I really put my mind to it, I can recall precisely eight telephone numbers in full, including that of Radio York, a station I haven't listened to in years, and not including those of several of my closest friends. This causes me very few problems. The numbers I need are stored in my phone, while similar technological crutches exist for almost every imaginable form of data. Being able to recite the kings and queens of England means little, surely, compared with knowing where to find that information online in a matter of seconds, along with all the presidents of America, 30 recipes for spaghetti carbonara, the full text of Paradise Lost, and pretty much anything else. To invest precious time and energy enhancing my capacity for rote learning would seem eccentric. But such eccentrics do exist. The most talented (and, apparently, the most eccentric) spend their lives on the competitive memorisation circuit; the endearingly geeky world that Joshua Foer sets out to explore in this witty and revelatory book. ""Anyone could do it, really,"" Ben Pridmore, thrice winner of the World Memory Championships, observes in the opening pages, referring to his ability to memorise the order of a shuffled deck of cards in 32 seconds, and to recite pi to 50,000 decimal places. Foer decides to put that claim to the test, and to his own astonishment ends up winning the US National Memory Championships. (This is not a spoiler: the book's jacket reveals it.) Perhaps anyone can do it, then – or at least the sharp-brained, Yale-educated younger brother of the novelist Jonathan Safran Foer can. But the deeper question animating his adventure is why anyone would want to. Is this all just party tricks? Or in losing the ability to memorise, are we losing something essential to being human? That worry dates back to the invention of one of the very first memory crutches: writing. ""Socrates feared that writing would lead the culture down a treacherous path of intellectual and moral decay,"" Foer explains. ""Because even while the quantity of knowledge available to people might increase, they themselves would come to resemble empty vessels."" The key technique still used by today's memory champions, known as the ""memory palace"", is ancient, too. Credited to the Greek poet Simonides of Ceos, it involves remembering sequences of words by imagining objects placed around a physical setting you know well, such as your home. ""The thing to understand, Josh, is that humans are very, very good at learning spaces,"" says Ed Cooke, the ebullient British memory grand master who becomes Foer's coach, talking him through the exercise in order to remember a shopping list featuring such items as pickled garlic and cottage cheese. ""For your first memory palace, I'd like you to use the house you grew up in . . . I want you to close your eyes and try to visualise in as much detail as possible a large bottle of pickled garlic standing right where the car should be parked."" Then, proceeding to the front door: ""I want you to imagine Claudia Schiffer swimming in [a] tub of cottage cheese . . ."" Even the supermodel aspect dates back centuries: sexual images are more memorable. ""If you wish to remember quickly, dispose the images of the most beautiful virgins into memory places,"" advised Peter of Ravenna, a 15th-century writer on the topic. The secret to an amazing memory, then, is essentially a trick. (The book's title refers to another vivid image Foer concocted for a similar exercise.) Truly photographic memories – Lisbeth Salander from Stieg Larsson's Millennium series notwithstanding – are now largely considered to be a myth. The key is to link what we're poor at remembering (words, numbers) to what we're good at remembering (environments). To those of us who can't remember phone numbers but who can recall almost perfectly the floor plan of the infants school we attended, this makes eminent sense. In itself, however, the act of memorising things does not provide limitless journalistic colour, and it is Foer's detours down other side-streets of memory that make for some of the book's most compelling moments. In California, he meets the retired lab technician known in the psychological literature as EP, a victim of such catastrophic amnesia that, like the British musician and documentary subject Clive Wearing, he forgets almost everything almost immediately – including, of course, the fact of his forgetting. At this extreme frontier of non-remembering, the centrality of memory becomes clear. EP (who died before the book was published) is as focused on the present as any Zen monk, and seems happy enough. But rich human relationships are fundamentally beyond his reach: they are built on shared memory and, as Foer puts it, cannot sustain themselves solely in the present tense. Among those least charitably portrayed is Tony Buzan, the British memory impresario, who as one of the founders of the World Memory Championships hovers behind much of the action. ""Everything about Buzan gives the strong impression of someone wanting to make a strong impression,"" Foer writes of the globe-trotting guru, who claims to have the highest ""creativity quotient"" in the world, and who annoys other memory specialists with his fondness for scientific-sounding but preposterous statements. (An example: ""Very young children use 98% of all thinking tools . . . by the time they're teenagers, they're down to 50%."") After pleading busyness, he eventually grants Foer an interview, in his chauffeur-driven 1930s taxicab, en route to his Thames-side estate. ""Buzan is – as he often found occasion to remind me – a modern Renaissance man . . . his latest collection [of poetry] consists entirely of poems written on and about his 38 transatlantic flights aboard the supersonic Concorde,"" the author notes dryly. Studious practice of the memory palace technique and others, under Cooke's guidance, ultimately catapults Foer to his surprise victory in the US competition, during which he memorises a pack of cards in one minute and 40 seconds. ""You are now the undisputed owner of the brains of America!"" an ecstatic Cooke tells him, though he does so by phone, having by now decided to relocate to the University of Sydney to study the philosophy of cricket. (""He was also working on inventing a new colour,"" we learn.) Foer advances to the world championships, but performs poorly. Neither the victory nor the defeat seem to bother him much either way, and this sense that he's not especially committed to the competitive memorisation lark is his book's only significant fault. But it is a minor one; his broader journey certainly demonstrates how much memory matters, even if it's hard to make the case that memorising, say, 107 first and last names and their associated faces from photographs in 15 minutes – another feat Foer pulls off – matters quite as much. Apart from anything else, filling up our mental storehouses in the right way can make life feel longer. ""Creating new memories stretches out psychological time, and lengthens our perception of our lives,"" Foer explains. This is why it's important to travel to new locations and try new activities, and it makes intuitive sense that a well-exercised memory, practised at retaining information, might be able to maximise that lengthening effect. He even ends up endorsing the wisdom that lies behind Buzan's bluster. Memorisation has a bad reputation in education today, dismissed as antithetical to creativity. But we don't need to choose between abandoning it entirely, on the one hand, or retreating into Michael Gove-ish calls for a return to the old days of chanting British monarchs by rote. The truth lies in the middle: a supple memory provides the basis for retaining the information from which creative new ideas can then be forged. Besides, Foer adds, ""what I had really trained my brain to do, as much as to memorise, was to be more mindful, and to pay attention to the world around me. Remembering can only happen if you decide to take notice."" It is a point that lingers in the memory, alongside the image of Claudia Schiffer in a tub of cottage cheese.

"If you want a glimpse of the anger and heartache caused by the Goldstone report into the Gaza conflict of 2008-9, you could do worse than take a trip to the National Theatre. There a new and absorbing play, The Holy Rosenbergs, imagines the rift in a British Jewish family sparked by the daughter's work as a lawyer for a Goldstone-like inquiry into Israeli conduct in Gaza. It is the eve of her brother's funeral, and the local rabbi urges her to stay away: if she attends, pro-Israel activists will demonstrate at the cemetery. If that sounds a stretch, think again. A year ago, Richard Goldstone – the eminent judge who had headed a UN fact-finding mission to Gaza – was told by key players in the South African Jewish community that he should not come to the synagogue where his grandson was due to have his bar mitzvah: if Goldstone showed his face, the 13 year-old's big day would be disrupted by protests. In the end, the row was resolved, but that is about the only part of the Goldstone saga that was: the rest remains fiercely contested, for reasons which point to a much larger story than simply the tale of one man and his report. That particular battle has been reignited by the op-ed piece the judge wrote last week in the Washington Post ""reconsidering"" his own report and withdrawing what had been his most devastating finding. Goldstone wrote that the latest evidence ""indicate[s] that civilians were not intentionally targeted as a matter of policy"".     Illustration by Peter Till    The import of that sentence can hardly be exaggerated. His original suggestion that Israel had been guilty of ""wilful killings"" of ""protected persons"" had been received as the most damning indictment possible, an international mark of Cain on Israel's forehead. Anti-Israel activists had seized on it; many Israel supporters branded Goldstone a traitor, ignoring his own description of himself as a proud Zionist. Now the two camps are strapping on their rhetorical armour all over again. Israel advocates are savouring the Goldstone semi-retraction as sweet vindication, believing the entire report can now be trashed; Israel's opponents are looking for those unwithdrawn charges that still have to be answered. One side revels in Goldstone's bald declaration that ""Hamas has done nothing"" to follow the report's key recommendation – which was for both Israel and Hamas to investigate the charges against them. The other notes the gravity of the outstanding claims and the fact that Israel's own investigations, while numbering 400, have led to all too few prosecutions. None of this will bring back the more than 700 noncombatants, many of them children, who were killed in Gaza during those appalling winter weeks. Nor will it end the argument chiefly because, as many have noted, Goldstone was never going to be a cool, legal process but a burningly political one. That was baked in from the start, in a way that points to that wider and deeper problem. For who was it that commissioned Goldstone and his team to look into Gaza? It was the UN Human Rights Council. That sounds like an eminently respectable body – until you look at its record. A 2010 analysis showed that very nearly half of all the resolutions it had passed related to Israel: 32 out of 67. And guess which country is the only one to be under permanent review, on the agenda for every single meeting? Israel. There is only one rapporteur whose mandate never expires. No, it's not the person charged with probing Belarus, North Korea or Saudi Arabia, despite the hideous human rights records of those nations. It is Israel. The UNHRC, whose predecessor body was once, laughably, chaired by Libya, had originally asked Goldstone to probe just one side of the Gaza war: it was only the judge's own insistence that he investigate Hamas too that widened his remit. No wonder Goldstone says now of the body he served that its ""history of bias against Israel cannot be doubted"". We can laugh at an organisation so potty it would put a murderous tyrant like Muammar Gaddafi in charge of monitoring human rights around the globe. But in its belief that no country in the world behaves worse or matters more, a belief expressed by the sheer volume of attention it pays to Israel, it reflects a view that is alarmingly widespread. Many respectable folks have spent decades insisting that the ""core issue"" in the Middle East, if not the world, is the Israel-Palestine conflict – that it is the ""running sore"" whose eventual healing will heal the wider region and beyond. That was always gold-plated nonsense, but now the Arab spring has come along to prove it. Now the world can see that the peoples of Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, Yemen, Syria and Bahrain have troubles aplenty that have nothing to do with Israel. There could be peace between Israelis and Palestinians tomorrow, but it wouldn't relieve those in Damascus or Manama or Sana'a from the yoke of tyranny. For them, Israel is not ""the heart of the matter"", as the cliche always insisted it was. The heart of the matter are the regimes who have oppressed them day in, day out, for 40 years or more. Yet it is not the suffering of these hundreds of millions of Arabs which has attracted the sympathy of the UN Human Rights Council. Nor has it stirred the compassion of left-leaning liberal types who pride themselves on thei r care for the oppressed. Few places get them excited the way Israel does. So in 2009 Sri Lanka could kill between 7,000 and 20,000 civilians, displacing 300,000 more in its bombardment of the Tamils at about the same time as the Gaza conflict – but you will search in vain for the Goldstone report into Sri Lankan war crimes. Nor will you find Caryl Churchill writing a play called Seven Sri Lankan Children – asking what exactly is it in the Sri Lankan mentality that allows them to be so brutal. There is no Goldstone or Churchill to probe the 4 million deaths in the Congo, the slaughtered in Darfur or the murdered in the Ivory Coast, let alone the civilian deaths inflicted by the US and Britain in Iraq and Afghanistan. No one is proposing an academic boycott of those nations or any of the other serial violators of human rights. Tellingly, two members of the four-person board of the LSE's Middle East Centre are firm advocates of cutting all scholarly ties to Israel – but were only too happy for the college to receive £1.5m from the Gaddafi family. Many will say that there is indeed a double standard – but it benefits Israel, routinely protected by a US veto at the UN unavailable to those weaker states deemed hostile. That may be true of the most powerful western governments. But when it comes to the academic, cultural and, yes, the media sphere, the bias often works the other way around. To be clear, this is not to deny that there is a desperately serious problem in Israel-Palestine. There is, and Israelis and Palestinians need it to be solved. I fully understand why Jews and Palestinians regard their conflict as the central issue in the universe. But for the rest of the world to see it that way – the way those who despatched Judge Goldstone saw it – makes no sense at all. • Comments on this article are set to remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight","Where's the Goldstone report into Sri Lanka, Congo, Darfur – or Britain? | Jonathan Freedland",2011-04-06T07:30:00Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"Barely through the entrance and we're looking for the exit. The Libyan intervention is just 11 days old, but already the clamour is for an end. Polls show almost identical levels of weak support on both sides of the Atlantic, a meagre 45% in Britain and 47% in the US. (At the equivalent stage, 90% of Americans backed the war in Afghanistan, and 70% supported the invasion of Iraq.) Each day brings conflicting signals as to whether the end is near. News of rebel advances on Monday brought hope that Colonel Gaddafi might be gone by the end of the week. The morning bulletins on Tuesday brought word of pro-Gaddafi successes, suggesting that the dictator would not be out any time soon. That's what a protracted civil war could look like, a tug of war between two armed groups where the momentum shifts back and forth. But this very pattern presents an awkward question for the alliance thumping Libya and for all those who supported this intervention: a question that becomes all the more urgent on those days when the rebel forces do well. Put simply, how can the allies keep attacking Libya if the threat that brought them there is receding? The UN approved military action – with the backing of the Arab League and the pointed non-opposition of Russia and China – for a very specific reason: to ""protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack"". That was the legal form of words, but the moral case was direct. Gaddafi had his ""knife to the throat"" of the civilians of Benghazi; if he were not stopped, he would stage a massacre. Yet on Monday Barack Obama was glad to tell the American people: ""Tonight, I can report that we have stopped Gaddafi's deadly advance."" In similar mood, the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-Moon, told Tuesday's London conference that we ""have averted a humanitarian crisis"". In which case, why are we still there? If the knife is no longer at the throat and if, thanks to coalition air strikes, the knife has now been severely blunted, isn't the basis for this intervention melting away? There's a legal, even moral, way to look at this question and a political way – and the two are diverging by the day. The lawyers are indeed sounding the alarm. Philippe Sands QC, an authority on such matters, is clear: ""The resolution allows for protection of civilians from the threat of attack. If the threat of attack has ceased, there is no justification for the use of force."" Morally, too, those who only backed this move because they wanted to prevent another Srebrenica – and I put myself in this category – can hardly maintain their support once that core goal has been achieved. If the allies had a duty to act, then once that duty has been discharged – and the threat has been repelled – their only responsibility is to go home. The problem, of course, lies in the meaning of that word ""threat"", a word the UN resolution was careful not to define. Here's where the rarefied abstractions of international jurisprudence hit the dusty, blurry realities on the ground. It is, admits Sands, an ""empirical question"", one whose answer can vary hour to hour and from person to person. When Obama spoke on Monday, with the rebels surging, it did indeed look as if Gaddafi's threat to civilians had receded. Twenty-four hours later, with Gaddafi's forces back inside the crucial rebel-held town of Misrata, the threat had returned. Some set the bar high, approving of action only if Gaddafi poses a threat that is unambiguous and imminent, the knife at or heading towards the throat. Others include indirect threats, arguing that if the Libyan regime exposes civilians to danger by conducting military activity in built-up areas, that too justifies action. And still others, such as Liam Fox, say that the threat has not gone until every Libyan can ""sleep in their beds"" free of fear – until, in other words, Gaddafi is removed from power. (And that's even before you've considered the possible threat to civilians posed by the armed rebel groups themselves.) Perhaps the best working definition is that offered by Obama the day after the UN passed its resolution. He demanded that the regime leave Benghazi alone; pull back from Ajdabiya, Misrata and Zawiya; let water, electricity and gas flow to those areas; and allow in humanitarian aid. If those demands are met, then any reading of the resolution and therefore international law says the west must cease its fire – even if that means leaving Gaddafi still safe in his Tripoli palace. If he threatens civilians once more, then the UN resolution can be ""reignited"" – the word of choice among lawyers, conscious that the word ""revived"" carries too many echoes of the old Iraq arguments – and the allies can resume their bombing. Otherwise, they have to lay down their weapons. That, at any rate, is what international law says. But this is politics and they are not the same. The political reality is that no one wants to see the stalemate scenario, in which Gaddafi clings on as the seething ruler of a Tripoli-plus statelet in the west, while the rebels control the east. They want him gone, no matter how much they have to stretch the language of the UN resolution to achieve that outcome. Obama, no less than Cameron or Sarkozy, knows that public opinion will only see this action as a success if Gaddafi falls. Britain, France and the US are also mindful that, with a handover to Nato imminent – giving Turkey, Germany and Italy, all of whom are tepid at best about military action, a role in decision-making – they don't have long to tilt things their way. Watch in the next few days as the three core allies make a last push, in the hope they can nudge the colonel off his perch. They will keep up the air strikes, whether the original threat is there or not. That is the nature of realpolitik. But there is a hard-headed case for a ceasefire sooner rather than later. For one thing, there is at least a chance to broker a deal with Gaddafi and his family, one that would involve exile and – painfully sacrificing justice for the sake of peace – the removal of any threat to put him in the dock at the international criminal court. But there is a larger purpose too. By calling a halt when the resolution says they should call a halt, the allies will be showing that international law is not just a matter of what suits the powerful. Our leaders always like talking about the credibility of the UN. Well, agreeing to ceasefire – especially an inconvenient one – would help. It may also be vital for the future of humanitarian intervention itself. Right now, too many believe that interventions will always be code for regime change, that they will always succumb to mission creep, that they will always drag on for years. What better way to disprove that than by showing that sometimes a humanitarian intervention can be just that – a short, sharp action designed to avert a catastrophe. When there was a clear and present danger, it was right to act. When that danger has receded, it's right to stop.","We've avoided a Libyan Srebrenica, so when is the bombing going to stop? | Jonathan Freedland",2011-03-29T21:00:00Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"As Oxford University's bigwigs and donors cheered their boat race victory from their launch last Saturday, their delight was interrupted by a blatant fundraising speech from the vice-chancellor, Andrew Hamilton. Now, surely, he said, they should donate. I hope they give not a penny until that university has found the courage to face down the government on fees and gone properly independent, which is wholly within its rights. If Oxford will not stand up for university autonomy, who will? The long road to scholastic subservience to the state began under Margaret Thatcher in 1988 and is approaching denouement. So far the only fixed point in the decline has been the gutless, whining, leaderless cowardice of university vice-chancellors and their boards. If a future historian wishes to chart the demise of the British university, this is the moment to start. No account could do full justice to the absurdity of the coalition's so-called fees policy. To describe the rise from £3,000 to a maximum of £9,000 a year as ""an increase in student fees"" is simply wrong. The thousands of students who march against it are deluded. Student fees have been abolished by the coalition and replaced by a long-term loan with no down-payment, guaranteed by the government, funded by the taxpayer and reclaimed from taxation only when the graduate earns enough. Only a third of the loans are expected to be repaid. This is a university voucher repaid from supertax – a Labour policy. Thatcher's children are marching not against fees but against middle-class taxes, though even these will not be as high as those probably faced by their parents before Thatcher came along. The mystery is how ministers have allowed themselves to be bamboozled by their opponents' propaganda. They have wriggled and churned and tortured themselves to reduce the fees, ease the fees, subsidise the fees, when they know perfectly well there are no fees. The loan guarantee should be known as a ""fee-grant"". To be sure, if middle-class parents are stupid enough to save the government money by paying the fee-grant up front, no one can stop them. As it is, the exchequer is doling out billions of pounds in yet another middle-class subsidy for which ministers are not getting an ounce of credit. It makes Andrew Lansley's NHS reform look like a model of nuanced sophistication. Now we move to scene two. The cost of these tripled fee-grants is to be met by cutting teaching grants. Thus hurled towards bankruptcy, a half to three-quarters of universities are said to be planning to charge near the full £9,000. Their plight is worsened by the Home Office seeking to withdraw £2bn in overseas student fees. In other words, what the government saved on the teaching grant it will more than lose on fee-grants, reputedly as much as £1bn. Even a Whitehall economist could have predicted that. At which point Lewis Carroll enters. Vince Cable, the universities minister, is under huge pressure to staunch the haemorrhage from the exchequer. He has already threatened to fine any university £3,000 per student if it ""over-recruits"". A further fine will be imposed on any that ""unreasonably"" charges £9,000, or charges more than £6,000 other than in ""exceptional circumstances"". This zany inversion of Stalin's Stakhanovite system could only come from a brain softened by panic. Meanwhile Cable's quango, the ""office for fair access"" or Offa, is operating on planet Zog. Unaware that the regime for poor students is the most favourable ever, Offa is trying to get more of the working classes into universities. Also with its eye on the now famous £9,000, it wants a large chunk of it, as much as £1,000, spent on ""outreach"" to the disabled, ethnic minorities and the poor. If this does not happen it, too, will ban or fine the £9,000. Offa wants universities to set and meet targets for retention rates and state school entrants, and says it can fine them up to £500,000 for a ""wilful and serious breach"". Curiously the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, appeared to negate this by saying universities ""haven't got permission"" to raise fees unless they can prove their intake will ""dramatically increase the number of people from poorer and disadvantaged backgrounds"". This implies universities have no autonomous power to raise fees but must await an inspection, proof of widened access, and then permission. I gather the legal basis for this assertion is unclear. At the last count, 90% of university outreach spending took the form of bursaries, in effect removing students from the loans bank and reducing the number who will ever repay anything. The tax system will thus have a bizarre new coding: above a given level of income, there will be one code for those whose parents were poor and a higher one for those whose parents were rich. This must be a new departure in fiscal socialism – and one created by a Tory chancellor. The reality is that no one has defined the proper balance of financial responsibility for higher education between government, universities, parents and students. The government is splashing money and bureaucracy over students of all income levels and universities of all degrees of quality. The result is a centralisation of targets, norms and oversight that must render a university little more than an administrative outpost of the department for business, innovation and skills – a title that significantly does not include the word education. Universities have spent 30 years selling their souls to the state in return for money. Faust's retribution is at hand. Some hoped a Tory government would uncap the fees and re-establish the autonomy that made British universities world leaders. The opposite has happened. There is no respect for any market, let alone one in quality. Nor is there any respect for academic or institutional autonomy; merely a Stalinist obsession with control. But there is an escape. Universities are independent charities. They can charge what they like and call the government's outreach bluff, should it refuse bursary or loan support. Universities could organise and fund their own scholarships, sell their research in the marketplace, and base their appeal on the quality of their work. Nothing but their addiction to government money is forcing them to toe the Cable line. If any university could afford to make the first move, it is Oxford. It could do so tomorrow if it had the guts. Its friends should give it money then, but only then.",Britain's universities must now declare their independence | Simon Jenkins,2011-03-29T20:00:01Z,Simon Jenkins,politics
"At the time of writing, the death of Elizabeth Taylor has yet to feature on Goop, the lifestyle website founded and run by another movie star, Gwyneth Paltrow. Admittedly, the older actress's weakness for bourbon, hot dogs and prescription drugs are not a natural fit with Gwyneth's tips for eternal life – how differently Taylor's career might have ended had she stuck to morning draughts of kale juice, ""full of calcium and antioxidants"" – but in the tributes following her death, many varied, usually dissonant voices have agreed that the woman, with all her fleshly vices, was a goddess and an inspiration of the sort we shall not see again. We find Julie Burchill, for instance, who once addressed Camille Paglia as a ""crazy old dyke"", in full agreement with the latter's view of Taylor as the ultimate, earthy broad, a hotter, riper, more fascinating star than the warmest of her pallid and sober successors. Elsewhere, an army of male admirers, with their expressions of longing for sottish outbursts and fleshy curves in slips, echoes not only Paglia's wonderful 1992 essay on ""pre-feminist"" Taylor, ""Hollywood's Pagan Queen"", but the lamentations of the officially flesh-hating Vogue, which now declares that the woman, with all her absurd rocks, furs and white hotpants, is a fashion icon as well as a sex siren. In fashion circles, it is usually accepted that women the shape and size of Elizabeth Taylor are not merely poor role models who should never be allowed outside a kaftan, but actively dangerous to thin people's health. It is said, on good authority, that Anna Wintour once gained three pounds after a single glance in the rotund star's direction. That is why she and so many slender celebrities prefer to wear dark glasses. But now vogue.com tells readers: ""If you ever thought, even for a moment, that skinny is better, that you need to spend a lot on an evening dress to look spectacular, you have only to gaze at Elizabeth Taylor as Gloria Wandrous in Butterfield 8, leaving Weston Liggett's apartment in a satin slip (albeit covered by Liggett's wife's mink coat), after a rough night during which her frock was eviscerated."" Brace yourself, then, and your chairs, for the coming procession of heavier, sluttier stars and celebs: for Jennifer Aniston looking a bit pissed and bulging through a bargain slip, for Anna Wintour snacking earthily on a Scotch egg, for Victoria Beckham modelling her plus-size line for the larger lady, for Nicole Kidman living the Taylor dream – mascara all down her face and a forkful of whiskey spaghetti (a Taylor favourite) in her gob. For if last week's coverage is to be believed, Vogue's fat-forgiving epiphany was not confined to the crazier heights of the fashion industry. Media professionals whose entire raison d'etre is the persecution of the female and physically imperfect have also acknowledged what Susie Orbach and, up to a point, Nigella Lawson, have been trying to tell them for years: skinny is not always better. And as if the implications of that were not hard enough to take in, the same caution, to judge by the Daily Mail's Taylor tributes, should also be applied to the received wisdom about female sobriety, sexual continence and not letting yourself go. Is it too late to fatten up Jenni Murray, whose arduous weight loss is now being chronicled in that paper? Or time for an apology to Ulrika Jonsson, who has had fewer marriages (three) than Taylor (eight), but gets so much more stick for them? There might even be a pardon from the red-top Taliban for Kate Moss, most recently arraigned for a) smoking in a public place, b) ""strutting"", c) doing both the above in a pair of pants, and d) having cellulite at the age of 37. At around Moss's age, Taylor was watched by journalist Philip Norman shrieking her head off at 2am in a hotel lobby. She was ""brimful of hellcat fury,"" he wrote last week, recalling an episode that was presumably the 1968 equivalent of Paltrow striving to be ""strong and not strident"". ""Her hair was a tangled mess, her Cleopatra-style eye make-up had gone smudgy. She wore a tatty black leather coat over a tarty red chiffon nightdress, and was barefoot."" Plainly, her body was crying out for a Gwynnie spring detox, which activates the liver with stretches and plenty of liquorice and mung bean water. Actresses have learned from Jane Fonda to exploit their enforced eating disorders, transforming these privations into brands, diet books, exercise regimes, swimwear. For Taylor, doing perfume allowed her to carry on bingeing, rowing and hypnotising men like young Norman. He remembers her doing the old violet-eye thing on him: ""As she smiled at me, I felt suddenly robbed of breath, as if my Adam's apple had become double its normal size."" If there is even a suspicion of truth in tributes which have, to the last eulogist, declared the sublime, apple-tumescing appeal of a plump, lustful, self-destructive alcoholic, whose excesses make top femme fatale Angelina Jolie look like a much tattooed Milly-Molly-Mandy, you have to wonder if blanched, gristly diet victims along Renée Zellweger's lines really represent any kind of shared ideal. Is it possible that some of the men and women who now police Kate Moss's arse for evidence of unlicensed excess secretly share Burton's tolerance of ""a slight pot belly""? Or are they in the grip of collective body dysmorphia? Since comments like the Mail's recent: ""She can't hide her healthy curves"", as if non-anorexic Emma Watson were about to morph into the ""Willendorf Venus"", could only otherwise indicate ungovernable malice, we must incline toward the second diagnosis. As Susie Orbach keeps saying, most recently in her Endangered Species campaign, the relentless pressure on women to emulate Hollywood's unblemished head on a stick is viciously unhealthy and damaging. The campaign's advertisements, featuring a naked baby and the question: ""Is this the happiest she'll ever be about her appearance?"", only exaggerate by not making the model a four-year-old. With their new trick of getting pretty youths instead of girls to wear their clothes on the catwalk, parts of the fashion industry have gone further. It's just boys in dresses, but it speaks of a kind of hands-off, fashiony longing for female mutilation: women are born the wrong shape. You could argue, perhaps, that if the great majority of men were similarly repelled by real women's bodies, with their annoying spare flesh and wobble, then the exaltation of a Victoria Beckham – knobbly and hobbled, bowed and insanely thin – would at least have some helpful, educative purpose. And she's got Beckham, after all. But allow for all the gush and nostalgie de la boue and a becoming unwillingness to speak ill so soon and Taylor's dazzled obituaries still tell a different story. At its most basic, it goes: easy on the kale.",The strange case of Liz Taylor as a 'real woman' role model | Catherine Bennett,2011-03-27T00:06:00Z,Catherine Bennett,uk
"'Work will make you free."" This sign was hung at the entrance to concentration camps, notably Auschwitz. But this sentiment has been the policy of every government, in various guises, since I was old enough to get a job. When I was 14 and stacking shelves in a supermarket, work did indeed give me money to spend on cider and black, because I lived in the olden days before the ice melted and alcopops were born. My mother's ambition for me was that I might, when I left school, graduate to working at Boots. And from there, work my way up in Boots, and possibly manage to marry someone better than me. Weirdly, none of this materialised, much to her eternal chagrin, but I certainly had a lot of jobs before this one. For which I am thankful. All kinds of jobs! Despite daft careers advice suggesting I become an air hostess or enter the navy, and a traumatic interview at an insurance firm in which I got the decimal point in the wrong place. ""Not only should you not work in this office,"" said the irate man, ""you should never be allowed to work in any office."" I took this to heart. I was bitterly wounded. But there were, in those days, jobs that didn't involve offices, and I had a different one every week. Indeed, rather as with politicians who have only ever been in the political system, I feel journalism should not be the preserve of those who have never done jobs ""in the real world"". I can always tell who has never had an actual job. It shows when you are with people who are rude to waitresses because they have never had to serve someone. It shows when people moan about shop assistants in chain stores not caring much about customer service. Clearly, they don't know how boring it is. It shows in the generalised assumption that the person on the checkout has not a thought in their head. To question different kinds of work experience and the value placed upon it may seem obtuse, as the new unemployment figures are predictably dreadful. But if the belief remains that work is indisputably good and not working indisputably bad, what are we to do with the so–called ""lost generation""? There is some argument over the figures, but roughly one in five of our 18- to 25-year-olds are out of work. This is happening at a time when education is becoming more expensive. The slash-and-burn aspect of coalition dogma does not make sense unless we accept the price of its policies is to make a pyre of a generation's hopes. The young, we can see, as well as women and children, must bear the brunt of the recession. Public-sector cuts affect women disproportionately, while education cuts and caution among small business affect our youth employment. The miracle of growth appears to involve the sacrifice of our young. If they make it through school, and a stupefying number of exams, and get to college, they will be in debt for a long time. This will force many of them to return home or never to leave. The idea of adulthood as an autonomous state with a home of one's own was once, for some, a rite of passage. Now it is a privilege. Jobs are going to those with experience. To those aged 70, not 17! It is a depressing scenario for all of us, surely? As I read that one in three people over 65 may have dementia, I imagine my children unemployed while I go ploughing on dementedly for ever. Wouldn't a properly angry opposition (Labour?) want to do something about the distribution of work, as well as wealth? Or does it share the ideology that all/any work is magically liberating? Of course, work gives people status and identity and friendships and – hopefully – a living wage, but those with interesting jobs forget too easily that many people do not have fantastic careers. They get by. They get treated pretty badly. Wage–slavery is no picnic, which is why idealists once thought automation would free the masses. On the contrary, two wages are needed to raise a family instead of one. Most discussions on the work/life balance are a coded way of talking about sexual politics and the have-it-all/do-it-all woman has been documented in fiction and in fact. But the phrase ""work/life balance"" tells us something. Is work the opposite of life? For some, yes. For others, no. Many mothers will take jobs if they can find them and afford the childcare. Unemployment is not a desirable state for many. It can be hugely depressing, but then working in a call centre and having your toilet breaks monitored may not be fulfilling, either. Nonetheless, in some political fantasy world, work is the answer to every question. Those who cannot get work are morally inferior: feckless, workshy scroungers, mothers, people with disabilities or young. They should, if you talk to Tory ministers, be prepared to take on any jobs, as immigrants have done. Where are these jobs? The nostalgia about apprenticeships and manufacturing industries is simply that. Our young are not going to be metal bashers as we are competing in a globalised economy. They may well provide high-end services. This, after all, was the thinking behind sending 50% of our children to college. The other reason was that employers were complaining that too many school-leavers were simply not ""employment-ready"". The next bunch of graduates released into the community come summer will find it tough. Some will add on vocational skills. Some will endlessly intern for free, and many will wonder why they ever did a degree. Some will be fine because of nepotism and connections. (I note here that as we abolish EMA, we subsidise private schools through their charitable status to the tune of £130m.) Connexions, the advice service for teenagers, is being cut – at a time when young people might need help over tuition fees, competition and careers. Headteachers are furious as they point out teachers are not career advisers. Joined-up thinking may try to incorporate this lost generation into … I don't know … the ""big society""? Or are they to be for ever locked out? Where does the lost generation live? Presumably in a separate universe to ""the squeezed middle"" or ""alarm clock Britain"". A universe that has it own ""direction of travel""? What kind of work/life balance are we talking about now when a life on the minimum wage is but a dream? I like to look forward, not back, and I was lucky, but the scale of youth unemployment scares me. I am not an ""All right Jack"". Or Jill. For I see too many boarded-up shops and clubs in too many towns, and it's like before, when I was young. And the Specials still play in my head: ""Government leaving the youth on the shelf/ This place is coming like a ghost town."" I don't know if ghost-faced Osborne knows those words.

"Things may be grim and getting grimmer, but let's cheer up a little. Never mind that Labour just scored the second-lowest share of the vote in its history. Forget the fact that the Tories' free-market project is backed by a titanic array of forces, and that coalition with the Lib Dems strengthens their hand even further. No: as Britain is reshaped according to the same social model as, say, California, hold on. In four years' time Labour will be back in power – possibly aware of the weakness of its position, and likely to accept a lot of what it inherits. But keep calm and carry on; cling to that famous Herbert Morrison quotation. Socialism is what a Labour government does, remember? That would be an outrageous caricature of Labour groupthink, were it not dangerously close to the truth. In fairness to Ed Miliband, he has at least tried to alert his colleagues to their predicament, and the need for new thinking – although his thoughts still seem to be issued piecemeal, without much of a compelling account of either Labour's past, or its future. But on the whole, the party seems stubborn and self-righteous to the point of pomposity. One recent Labour saga says a lot. Towards the end of last year, the Labour-aligned pressure group Compass announced that it was minded to change its membership rules so as to put members of other political parties on the same footing as Labour people. Work with the Greens' Caroline Lucas and some Lib Dems had been productive, and exciting. The suggested change also recognised changing times: if the coalition seemed set on a realignment of the centre-right, wasn't it time to start thinking about the broadening of the centre-left? The move was put to the vote and passed; this week, an array of senior Greens, Lucas included, will join up. But as they have entered the room, others have stomped out. Most of the organising committee of Compass's youth wing have resigned, stating their case in a rather deadened vocabulary that will be familiar to people who spend their spare time fussing over resolutions. It was, they said, ""necessary to organise in support of the politics initially espoused by Compass as members of the party, within the party, rather than through a broader structure"". In this paper's Letters page, a brassed-off former member of Compass's executive committee writes that opening out is ""bizarre"" and, for some reason, at odds with the imperative to work for the return of a Labour government. Meanwhile, Labour's anti-AV tendency is in full cry, warning anyone who'll listen about a system that's supposedly ""complicated"" and, ""expensive"" and ""a politician's fix"". In fact, what many of them cannot abide is the prospect of a politics in which Labour will have to reach out a bit, and election campaigning will no longer consist of stupidly declaring war on everyone – Tories, Lib Dems, nationalists, Greens – with equal ferocity. These are people who remember Ken Livingstone's enlightened approach to other parties as London mayor, or the early Blair era's rapprochement with Paddy Ashdown's Lib Dems, and shudder. Indeed, their antipathy to any kind of pluralism is so deep that they have managed to create their own deranged version – making common cause with David Cameron, Michael Howard's old batman Lynton Crosby, and the Taxpayers' Alliance. In that lost world where Labour could scrape 50% of the poll and embed its ideas in society via a vast trade union membership, Labour-til-I-die politics just about worked. Now, in a world of plural identities, waning party loyalty and a resurgent right, it has to go. Put another way, if meaningful centre-left politics will inevitably annoy Rupert Murdoch, the CBI, and the forces of international capital, keeping them at bay will need a little more than a small hardcore of activists, a few hundred MPs and what remains of the Labour movement. Didn't work last time, did it? • This article was amended on 18 March 2011.

"To put it mildly, the career of Gary Goldsmith, the uncle of Kate Middleton, has had its ups and downs, leading to fears that the presence of Uncle Gary – Gary! – would cast a distinctly rough and common-looking shadow over the royal wedding. Could the tattooed proprietor of La Maison de Bang Bang, Mr Goldsmith's home in Ibiza, be trusted, for instance, to mingle responsibly with guests including the Sultans of Bahrain and Oman? Would he undo all the good work of The King's Speech? As if the commoner Middletons were not worrying enough to royal scholars such as James Whitaker, there had to be a risk that Goldsmith, a property developer, might, with his record of upstart hedonism actively contaminate an occasion featuring a King of Saudi Arabia, their Tonganese highnesses and the hardly less eminent royal broadcaster, ITN's Tom Bradby. Goldsmith's failings were not, like the Middletons' table manners, a matter for nervous conjecture, they had been recorded on tape by the News of the World's fake sheikh, posing on that occasion as a businessman. Goldsmith had vouchsafed, for example, that his first words to Prince William when the latter came to stay in the Bang Bang, were: ""Oi, you fucker, did you break my glass pyramids?"" (Mr Goldsmith collects glass pyramids.) In mitigation, Goldsmith was hospitable to a fault. He had, as an internet search will speedily reveal, offered the reporters cocaine and the number of a dependable pimp, a specialist in £600-a-night Brazilians. Hence, interested foreign journalists have been calling him things like ""le mouton noir"" or ""l'oncle trash"". As it is, following various acts of contrition, Kate Middleton's uncle, her mother's brother, will after all be invited to every part of the celebrations, along with all her fiance's uncles, Prince Edward, Viscount Althorp and, at the time of writing, Prince Andrew, that boon companion to eastern European tyrants and, when in America, the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and his alleged procuress Ghislaine Maxwell. Risky, perhaps, but at least it will be someone for Prince Andrew to talk to and vice versa. Although there is no suggestion that Prince Andrew has ever shown any interest in using prostitutes he is evidently happy to mix with men and women who do so. Moreover, having sold his former home for £3m more than its asking price, he might appreciate Goldsmith's professional knowledge of the property market. And yet Mr Goldsmith must be wondering, their legendary rudeness aside, does he really want to mix in this company? True, William appears to be a thoroughly blanc mouton and has overcome dreadful setbacks, but what can you say about his relations? Goldsmith is rich. What if a royal attempts to touch him for a free holiday in Ibiza, or even a loan? It happened with Epstein, who paid £15,000 towards Sarah Ferguson's debts. Present at this wedding will be at least two of the Windsors' financial incompetents, currently known to include: William's aunt-in-law, Sophie Rhys-Jones, whose RJ-H PR company left debts of £1.7m; another aunt-in-law, Sarah Ferguson, whose creditors have subsidised her £5m losses; lastly, William's uncle, the Earl of Wessex, whose investors were left with nothing when his film company, Ardent, went into voluntary liquidation, with assets of £40. Then there is the question of Mazher Mahmood, a person Goldsmith might want to forget. How can he when Kate's new family again features three of the fake sheikh's celebrated victims: Sophie Rhys-Jones, Sarah Ferguson and, in 2005, Princess Michael of Kent, who confided when Mahmood posed as a potential buyer for her house, that Charles had, in William's mother, married ""a womb"". If Mahmood bought, she told him, by way of an inducement, she would open a supermarket in Dubai for £25,000. Goldsmith's misgivings must be as nothing, however, compared with those of the Middletons. Yes, Kate is 28 and must think for herself, but it is only normal that decent parents like this, strangers to both bankruptcy and dependency, would wonder until the last minute if there is a way to stop their personable, carefully educated daughter marrying into a family where everyone, including the older males, relies on handouts from an elderly matriarch or the state. Hardly surprising, given their lifetime of dependency, that so many of William's relations have become resentful, infantilised, irresponsible. Not just Andrew – one thinks, in particular, of Princess Anne, repeatedly convicted for speeding, and once for owning a dangerous dog, Dotty, which having been acquitted in court of canine ""malice"" after biting two children, went on to kill one of her mother's corgis. That William's father does not so far as we know have any similar previous, cannot be much comfort to the Middletons as they contemplate their big fat Windsor wedding. Prince Charles's alternative thinking is harmless enough, until she falls ill, and no doubt William will prove a more reliable husband: a passion for Saudi Arabian royalty is less easily ignored. We can only speculate on the reasons why British royals are so dazzled by princes from despotic, corrupt, viciously misogynistic Arab states in which the routine torture, public executions and repression equal anything witnessed in the English middle ages, but the family weakness has certainly made life easier for Mazher Mahmood. For Kate, on the other hand, these tyrants will become cherished family friends, as they already are for her mentor and Diana's nemesis: Camilla. Factor in the Windsor family's divorce rate, its binge-drinking princesses, racist grandad and trashy oncles, and the only comfort for the Middletons is that this parasitic, feckless, ferociously right-wing family from hell, emblematic of so much that is amiss with Broken Britain, is not actually moving in next door. But that is only half of William's genetic inheritance. Possibly his non-royal uncle, Viscount Althorp's company will prove more congenial to a family such as Kate Middleton's, whose fortunes – as the doors-to-manual joke at least concedes – are all their own work? It was Charles Spencer who pledged as Diana's ""blood family"" to let William and Harry's souls ""sing openly"". It still remains to be seen whether they will rival his own, uninhibited example, featuring two marriages followed by two engagements, the second still scheduled for consummation in June. On the other hand, Spencer has no known connection with any dictators or sex offenders, is no longer friends with the convicted robber, Darius Guppy, and is thought once to have worked for a living, making him very nearly respectable. In any case, like King Lear, they have left a daughter. Simply because Kate has been led astray, like so many nice girls before her, does not mean that Pippa will go the same way. But they might, to be on the safe side, want to send her somewhere tyrant-free, such as Uncle Gary's Maison de Bang Bang.","Look what you're marrying into, Kate | Catherine Bennett",2011-03-13T00:09:00Z,Catherine Bennett,uk
"Civilisations need strong and properly functioning governments if they are to prosper. Without good government, economies and societies will fail. These should be statements of the obvious. Only governments can trigger the investment in the physical, social and human capital necessary to support growth. Only government can redistribute the income needed to alleviate poverty, and promote more equal opportunity. But today the very idea of the legitimacy of government is threatened. Government is sometimes its own worst enemy. Even those who want to defend the idea of the public realm must concede that public services need continual reform , that the state should have self-imposed limits and that although there may be reasons for caution about attacking the budget deficit, it cannot go on at current levels for ever. The state has to change even as you defend the idea of government. It is a nuanced argument that is hard to make in these binary times. You are either for government, in which case you find yourself defending the sometimes indefensible – or like some cabinet ministers you seize on every mistake as an example of systemic incompetence, rage at every instance of excess and celebrate the private sector. Yet even if the latter were as perfect as its ideological proponents claim, and the ""big society"" was running at full throttle, there would still be a proper role for the government. Curiously, this more subtle view of government and the private sector is most widely held by business, whose leaders are frequently trotted out to praise enterprise and rail against the dead hand of the state during elections. A recent global survey of CEOs showed a majority (61%) expressing concern over the size of today's fiscal deficits – but even more (72%) supported government policies to promote growth. Business leaders readily acknowledge that it takes governments to do everything from building infrastructure to dealing with climate change, regulating finance and creating a skilled workforce along the way. Nor is the issue solely economic. Public institutions are the means of expressing collective will and social solidarity: we want a strong police force, we value a service that delivers meals on wheels to the elderly. The public realm – a beautiful public park, an effective health service – is essential to our wellbeing. And it is the public character of these services that is so critical; they are available for every citizen and accountable to each of us. This does not mean that every such service has to be delivered by a public body; but if it is contracted out, it must retain its public character. Such qualities cannot be privatised. This is the background to the review of fair pay in the public sector that I have been leading for the last nine months, commissioned by the prime minister and chancellor and published later this week. There is undoubtedly a widespread perception that public sector managers are overpaid despite leading organisations that are inefficient. But if the debate about pay levels assumes that the public sector is a burdensome disaster, it can only demotivate staff who work there. If the overall reward package gets too weak, especially given the huge differentials with parts of the private sector, then it will make it harder to recruit and retain good people just at the moment the UK is embarking on an ambitious programme of public service reform. There is indignation against public sector managers' pay because they have been caught up in the backlash against the huge growth of the earnings of the top 1% over the last generation. Over the last nine years alone, CEO pay in our leading companies has doubled, despite little tangible increase in performance. Bonuses have been paid in bailed-out banks. There is widespread scepticism that these huge payments have been deserved. The public sector has not been immune from the same suspicion. The perception is that the public sector is awash with ""fat cats""; in one poll a quarter of respondents thought that public sector executives earned more than their private sector counterparts. Yet this is a world in which HSBC said recently that 253 of its staff made more than £1m and RBS confessed to a more modest 100 of its staff breaking that threshold. Nobody in the public sector makes a million pounds. Out of a workforce of nearly 6 million only a couple of dozen make more than £300,000. Yet 90% of the British make less than £45,000 a year; to them £300,000 is a huge amount of money. We are more likely to be forgiving if we believe that such amounts are deserved because their recipients have produced brilliant results as the result of hard work. The trouble is that in Britain there is no framework in either the public or private sector to explain why top pay is what it is. Almost nobody reads the technical and almost unreadable Remuneration Committee reports from our major companies, so that extraordinarily half the average remuneration of our CEOs is paid in generous grants of shares that very few can justify. Nor is the situation any better in the public sector; try to find an explanation of why top executives are paid as they are and what they do to earn their money and you search in vain. Most public officials are more apprehensive about being caught in the full glare of publicity over pay than their private peers – either running scared or at worse trying to disguise their rewards. Thus we have what we have. Private sector fat cats – who warrant most of the criticism – and their public sector counterparts, certainly paid very much less, but no less vulnerable to criticism because there is no pay framework by which to justify what they earn. This is red meat to both sides of the binary divide about the value of good government. But if you believe reality is more nuanced, and that public and private need each other, the consequence is a disaster. Britain needs a grown-up conversation about the relationship between its public and private sectors – and a framework in which taxpayers , shareholders, workers and customers can understand why our bosses are paid what they are, and to limit it when it gets out of hand. Stand by this week for my stab at an answer. The Hutton Review of Fair Pay in the Public Sector will be published on Tuesday","Yes, there are some big salaries in the public sector.

"It was, until recently, hard to imagine a more embarrassing uncle at the royal wedding than Kate's mum's brother, Gary Goldsmith, a ""property developer"" who lives in Ibiza half the year in a house regally called La Maison de Bang Bang. He has offered journalists the services of prostitutes while chopping up lines of cocaine. But competition is hotting up with embarrassing Uncle Andrew. For Prince Andrew, we now know, flies round the world to indulge his special relationships with various despots and Jeffrey Epstein, forever to be known as ""not quite a paedophile"". While Mr Goldsmith does what he does for himself, Andrew does business for Queen and country. He works for us. Or does he? Currently we are switching channels between two royal reality shows. One is the lovely wedding of Kate and Wills, for which we are meant to be grateful. But we can't help flicking back to all these revelations about what Prince Andrew's ""job"" involves. It has to be said that Andrew himself looks rattled, or just plain dodgy, in every picture of him doing his ""job"". Even ardent monarchists are finding his activities hard to stomach. The sight of the government now having to back Andrew, as he is ""unsackable"", makes one want to retch. But yes, he has David Cameron's full support, and Vince Cable's full confidence. Flogging arms and hanging out with Saudi princes is a dirty job, but someone has to do it. This is realpolitik, some may say. But the problem starts when trying to unpick what Andrew does for himself, and what he does that is overseen by the Foreign Office and UK Trade & Investment (UKTI), which has a committee that meets every six months to approve his visits to places such as Abu Dhabi, Vietnam and Turkmenistan. What is it exactly that he does on his private trips? There have been three of those to Azerbaijan (an autocracy fond of torturing dissidents) and at least one to Kazakhstan on the record, as well as outings to Saudi Arabia that are not financed by UKTI. The royal line is that there is no overlap between the prince's private and public role. That line is getting blurry. A Kazakh millionaire paid £3m above the asking price for the sale of Andrew's mansion. The go-between was the rather extraordinary Goga Askenazi, commonly referred to as ""a Kazakh siren"". Her father wrote speeches for Gorbachev, and she has made her fortune in mining, apparently. Where is Borat when you need him? Anyway, Goga reassures us that ""if you think Andrew is extravagant, you should see Berlusconi's set-up in Sardinia – outrageous"". Outrageous indeed. As is the Prince's friendship with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who bunged Andew's ex, Fergie, £15,000 to help clear her debts. Also possibly outrageous are Andrew's invites to the son-in-law of the former Tunisian dictator who is under investigation for money laundering. The BBC reports all this practically curtseying, insisting that all ministers can do is downgrade his role. Meanwhile, over on the Princess Channel, all that matters is Kate Middleton's amazing ability to toss a pancake. Royalists harp on about the symbolism of the royal family, but what Andrew and his brothers now symbolise is debatable. The Queen works hard and so does Anne, but the rest of them? Charles is now rarely seen. As for Edward, who knows what he does, except we know his wife's PR company got into enormous debt. Despite their immense connections, these royals do seem to have problems running any kind of business. Fergie, who I defended for a long time as a bit mad and sad, has now gone really bad, offering access to her ex, for whom she says she would throw herself under a bus, in exchange for cash. For the record, I was a cheerleader for Diana, as I like a troublesome woman who stirs things up. I never thought she was an actual republican, what with her wanting her son to be king and everything, but certainly she rocked the boat, and showed up this family for what it is. It may seem strange to say it, but at her funeral, which I attended, Andrew and Fergie seemed the most human of them. Fergie reached over and hugged those boys. No one else touched them in public the whole of that day. Now she is banned from the latest wedding and gabbling on about wanting to find ""the lotus flower within"". She has been cast out. The brutal dysfunction of the family is plain to see, but at this stage it's the dysfunction of the public that concerns me more. Those of us who champion republicanism must come to terms with the fact that it has never been a hugely popular cause. Years spent sitting in meetings about the constitution mean I have heard the great and the good explain patiently that we must attack the royals institutionally but not personally. It may seem surprising, but I don't agree, because the royals function largely by denial that they are part of a political system that accrues wealth. They modernise only when forced to, and are not accountable. They bypass the institution by using the media to insist we see them only as individuals trying to do their best. All this went askew because Diana's genuine charisma and easy modernity in an age of celebrity made them look like relics. We know how that all ended: nonetheless, Kate Middleton is being set up as the new Diana. So far she is doing what is required of a princess: shutting up/putting out/slimming down/marrying up. Kate is conforming to some reactionary idea about social mobility. If commoner can marry the heir to the throne … well, anything could happen. But it probably won't. For whatever we understand about Prince Andrew, there will be crowds cheering on this couple. Anyone who doesn't will be branded a sour–faced old trollop like me. Of course it will be an event, but who now turns out for the other royals? When Charles shows up anywhere they don't need to put out the barricades to stop jostling crowds getting at him. Years ago I was so bored at Windsor (it was Sophie and Edward's wedding) I started talking to policemen. Who are these flag-wavers, I asked one. ""Oh, we have a phrase for them,"" he said. ""Cat-stranglers. Women so mad they strangle their own cats."" That always stuck with me. A reasoned argument about the nature of hereditary privilege and how this affects our entire democracy and identity as engaged citizens doesn't really work with cat-stranglers. Nor indeed many who consider themselves a rung above. Look at the fawning over The King's Speech, which was not only revisionist but full of deference. The king stammered because of emotionally distant parents. He needed to unite the nation at a time of crisis. But it took a commoner to help him get over his speech impediment. The royals are now using another commoner – Kate Middleton – to help them over another little difficulty: that Andrew has demonstrated that there are lies at the heart of the firm. The current impediment is not one of speech but of morality. No amount of confetti can hide it.","Whatever we learn about Andrew, people will still cheer the happy couple | Suzanne Moore",2011-03-12T09:00:00Z,Suzanne Moore,uk
"God how dim am I because of course Rebekah was totally going to flake after BskyB but I was actually at her foetid old fish spa with both feet in the tank before she texted to say she was gutted, sudden fungal infection, blah blah lusm, so I would be all alone with the fish which is so disgusting as well as pointless, I mean I know Vince would do it for nothing, and not even true because Sarah Govey is a famous world expert on spas and apparently fungus is the fishes' absolute favourite after verrucas and corns, they go mad for it. So I rang Craig Whatever to say WTF and he went we have total confidence in Ms Brooks except when we don't, so I think I will not bother to learn his entire name.

"Rash or not, the martial spirit of the Cameroons amounts to a spectacle of untrammelled virility. In the shape of the education secretary Michael Gove, if reports are correct, this country boasts a positive geyser of testosterone. He has argued with enormous vigour – fortunate Mrs Gove! – for military intervention to topple military dictators and thugs, as and when they appear. Nor should we forget his comrade, Liam Fox, his military ambition limited only by his dwindling hardware; George Osborne, burning with a righteous, democratic fire and David Cameron, during those brief days, or hours, when a sudden urge to dash over to Libya had yet to be reined in by American doubts about the potential consequences. Even those who incline towards a more thoughtful approach would have to admit, in the light of modern neuropsychology, that the men could hardly be expected to control themselves, being in the grip of something much bigger than individual personality: hardwired male biology. Critics of armchair generals, those almost invariably male champions of no-fly zones and surging ground troops, might also reflect on the words of Professor Geoffrey Beattie, head of psychological sciences at Manchester University and resident psychologist on ITV's Ghost Hunting With Celebrities, who writes that men ""exhibit higher levels of sensation-seeking and risk-taking in a wide variety of settings"". Why is that, Professor Beattie? ""The basis for this well-established sex difference has a hormonal and neurochemical basis – it is not simply a product of socialisation or experience."" Quite possibly, your average upholstery-based brigadier, calling for something to be smashed to smithereens, pronto, is subconsciously attempting to attract mates and cannot help himself. And the male politicians and commentators, expert and otherwise, who urge cowardice or restraint? Well, let's just forget about them for the minute. For his insights into male behaviour, we are indebted to Professor Beattie's long paper, Sex differences in driving and insurance risk: understanding the neurobiological and evolutionary foundations of the differences. ""Stone-age man did not drive,"" establishes the professor, right from the start. ""But the legacy of his hunting, aggressive and risk-taking past – qualities that enabled him to survive and mate, thereby passing on his genes to future generations – are still evident in the way in which he typically drives his car."" The professor's findings, which must have struck a chilling note for anyone assigned a nearby place in the departmental car park, were commissioned by the insurance company Esure, which summarised his 2008 paper as Cavemen in Cars. Citing the research of Simon Baron-Cohen, favoured authority of the neuroscience best-sellers, on sex difference, Beattie explains why empathy-deficient males might express aggression as bad driving: ""In evolutionary terms, this direct form of aggression is a very efficient strategy for establishing social dominance or resolving social conflict."" It was also a highly efficient way of charging higher insurance premiums until last week's decision by the European Court of Justice, one which has caused distress in both male and female brains. What men gain from lower driving premiums they will lose in more miserly pension payouts. Women stand to lose, all round, from the court's ruling that to charge men and women different premiums amounts to sex discrimination. A spokesman for cavemen experts Esure, which owns the Sheilas' Wheels insurance company, produced some mournful testimony accompanied by an ad, on a newspaper website, explaining why it was so unfair. For every one woman convicted of dangerous driving within two years of passing her test, he said, there would 25 male offenders who had qualified at the same time: ""It's a great shame, it's a sad day."" Certainly, for any woman who has witnessed the demented behaviour of wannabe Richard Hammonds, as biology impels them to sacrifice cars, pedestrians, even their own lives, the decision looks costly and unfair, if not on the tragic scale suggested by Sheilas' Wheels, which has little interest in the theoretical benefits for women of non-discriminatory life insurance. Another reason, perhaps, why so many women have lamented the end of sexual determinism as applied to car insurance is that, for once, they had emerged as superior. Arguably, the ratio of car insurance premiums should reflect even more accurately the comparative carefulness of women, once you forget anomalies such as the stonktastic Princess Anne, repeatedly convicted of speeding, and Katie Price, talking on her mobile at the helm of a giant horse-mover, and Helen Chamberlain, the police superintendent recently fined for driving at 79mph in a 50mph zone. While we are being fair, it seems reasonable to reward responsible young male drivers for resisting not only the mischievous promptings of their hormones, but a lifetime's cultural conditioning to the effect that a speed limit is actually a challenge, and a car a glossy, supercharged weapon specifically engineered for the humiliation of rivals and erotic mastery over fertile women. In fact, if insurers want to save on payouts to young male drivers, they might do better to agitate against advertising behaviour of the Nissan ""Deutschland über rated"" variety than against a ruling which, when you look at it, seems the only consistent outcome for any culture that believes that individuals are not enslaved by their own biology. Driving insurance is an exception: popular thinking about biological difference usually concludes that women, with their allegedly diminished capacity for understanding and building systems, are hardwired to be inferior in status. Recall the then president of Harvard, Larry Summers, wondering if female underachievement in maths was not something innate? Following a no-confidence vote, Summers fled to the male-brained world of finance, but as Cordelia Fine establishes in Delusions of Gender, ""the sheer stability and staying power of the idea that male and female psychologies are inherently different can't help but impress"". An unequal status quo which used to be attributed to, say, women's wandering wombs or to their faulty spinal cords, is now – just as ignorantly, since it is purely speculative – traced to the female brain. Fine calls it neurosexism. Why, for example, are there barely any women at the top of politics? Not, the neurosexist will argue, because politics makes them so unwelcome. But because – it's a compliment, really – women's brains make them so rich in empathy. ""People with the female brain,"" says Baron-Cohen, ""make the most wonderful counsellors, primary school teachers, nurses, carers, therapists, social workers, mediators, group facilitators or personnel staff."" And men? Why, their talents seem to lie more in the direction of science, engineering, law, banking, stuff like that. It's hardwired, a point made repeatedly last week as men expressed their indignation at non-stereotypical insurance treatment. ""Men and women are different enough by nature that it seems fair to charge them different rates,"" declared the FT's Lex column. Must have been someone's time of the month.","Sorry, but cheaper car insurance patronises women | Catherine Bennett",2011-03-06T00:15:03Z,Catherine Bennett,uk
"Brega has fallen to Gaddafi. No, Brega has stood firm and Gaddafi has been driven back. The reports are clear, then ambiguous, then clear again. An aircraft flashes in the sky and a bomb explodes on the horizon. Nearer the camera, men are standing through the sunroofs of their cars waving guns: death to Gaddafi. Then, with a change of correspondent and location, the next shot shows women waving green flags and ululating: long live Gaddafi. ""How horrible, fantastic, incredible it is,"" as Neville Chamberlain said in 1938, ""that we should be digging trenches and trying on gas masks here because of a quarrel in a faraway country between people of whom we know nothing"". All of us know the quote, though most of us mangle the words (usually to ""a faraway country of which we know nothing""), and Chamberlain never comes well out of it. The country was Czechoslovakia and the quarrel, at least in Chamberlain's narrow focus, lay between the Sudeten Germans and the Czechs rather than between Hitler and the established national boundaries of Europe, which Hitler was soon to alter by invading Czechoslovakia. But however myopic, insular and self-deceiving Chamberlain may have been, one part of his sentence holds good. Most people in Britain knew very little about Sudentenland, just as today not so many of us know about Libya. I should speak for my own ignorance rather than anyone else's. Let's start with the trivial. Should it be Brega, Bregga, al-Brega or Mansara el-Brega? The town's significance is too new for the English-language media to have adopted a common transliteration from the Arabic (perhaps the same confusion was true at first of El Alamein in 1943 or, from other languages, Trafalgar in 1805 and Plassey in 1757). Then there's Libya's size. Who knew (not me) that its coastline was as long as the distance from London to Naples, that it was larger than Iran, Egypt and South Africa? Or that most of its six million people live near the sea in two of the country's three regions, Tripolitania in the west and Cyrenaica in the east, which are separated by a stretch of barren coastal desert? Or that the population in each has a different history and identity and seldom thought to describe themselves as ""Libyans"" until independence in 1951, a description borrowed from the Italians who made their North African colonies part of the mother country as Libia Italiana in 1939? I thought I knew some of this colonial history, but a few minutes' research proved that almost everything I thought I knew was wrong. It wasn't Mussolini who had secured this part of the old Ottoman Empire for Italy but the Italo-Turkish war of 1911 and the Treaty of Lausanne (or Ouchy) in 1912. When people are dying in gun battles, the Treaty of Ouchy may be the least of our concerns, but in more contemporary facts our ignorance is also quite profound. Are Libyans more, or less, prosperous than their neighbours the Egyptians and Tunisians? If this is a civil war, what separates the two sides? Is it simply Gaddafi, love him or loathe him, or do identity and geography, our old friends Tripolitania and Cyrenaica, come into it too? Watching television, I have no idea. Television likes to repeat the best pictures. The plane glints in the sky again, the bomb explodes, men point their automatic rifles jauntily at the sky and let off a few rounds, crowds push their faces at the lens and scream for or against Gaddafi. Blood can be seen on a pavement. Armed conflicts make journalism seem urgent and necessary, and the BBC and its audience are lucky to have courageous and sober correspondents such as John Simpson and Jeremy Bowen, neither of whom (so far as one can tell) exaggerate or overdramatise events to enhance their reporting. Nonetheless, what we see every night is a few edited minutes that select the most striking images – often guns and the effect of guns – with a question or two asked from the studio to the man on the spot. To those of us who've never paid much attention to Libya before, other than to the eccentric behaviour of its leader, a country's whole way of living is expressed as a physical struggle between a tyrant and his people. Perhaps this is what it is, though history tends to suggest that autocrats, however brutal, are usually sustained by a degree of popular support (one of those awkward facts that stands in the way of the lone assassin and ""shock and awe"" solutions). But even if it wasn't, the simple narrative demands of journalism (and not just on television) would push it in that direction. News by its nature concentrates on the frothing present. The sediment underneath, all those layers of history and ordinary lives, isn't its business. Consequently, we have very little idea of cause and effect. The uprisings in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya have different causes, even if they share a general complaint, but what struck me when each of them happened was how little I knew about any of them as societies, and how inadequate the media, especially television, was at the business of enlightening me. A 50-minute documentary built on old-fashioned principles – a map, archive footage, a knowledgeable commentary, a historian or two – would have done wonders. It could have been very simple: ""Twenty Things You Need to Know About …"" I wouldn't have minded some Reithian condescension. The humblest statistic – the price of mint tea, the average wage for a civil servant – would have etched the picture with some valuable detail. As it was, the demonstrations could have been happening in space. I suspect many foreign correspondents feel the same way; they may even feel it more keenly than the reader. Reporting from the Indian subcontinent in the 70s and 80s, I used to feel that every piece needed to be accompanied by a little panel of information that clarified, for example, Mrs Gandhi's non-relationship to Mahatma Gandhi, or what the phrase ""scheduled castes"" meant. To make a country intelligible to a reader who has never seen it – and there were far fewer tourists then – is a hard enough job: to do that and at that same time recount a complicated event in fewer than a thousand words is next to impossible. Usually, the first has to go. This partly accounts for the popularity of war reporting among both producers and consumers. Physical conflict is dramatic, speaks a universal language of death, destruction and winners and losers, and is easily followed and understood. Still, a question remains. If we had known more about the Sudetenland – its origins as part of Bohemia, its tussles with the newly created Czech Republic, its ethnic German majority – would we have been any better off? By the time 1938 came around, the answer, sadly, is no. It was by no means, as Chamberlain wanted so badly to believe, Hitler's last territorial claim in Europe. But we still need to know more about Libya. ""How horrible, fantastic, incredible it is that we should be risking the death of our pilots because of a quarrel in a faraway country between people of whom we know nothing.""

"Rupert Murdoch has always had an eye for a great deal. When he bid £7.2bn for the balance of BSkyB he did not own, he got in before other shareholders tumbled to how valuable the company was becoming. Full control would open up rich opportunities for ""tax efficiencies"" and cross-selling so crucial in the future digital world. His was a roll of the dice, leading, as he knows better than anyone, to a degree of press and television concentration unmatched anywhere. He had squared away David Cameron, as he had so many British and Australian prime ministers before. On Friday, a report in the Financial Times suggested that he is finally close to his goal – an announcement could be made as soon as this week. Britain, a country run by investment bankers for investment bankers, is organised on the principle that ownership does not matter. It is as easy as pie to buy quoted companies and then simple to act with only the faintest of constraints. Our cross-ownership rules in the media are the lamest of any in an industrialised country. Anybody who objects to this is jumped on as ""anti-enterprise"". There was one obstacle to Murdoch's ambitions – a clause Lord David Puttnam wrote into the 2003 Communications Act that media concentration must not inhibit the plurality of news provision. This concerns the BSkyB deal in two ways: that once Murdoch owns the entire company he can integrate his print and television news operations into one. And second, the sheer market power of News Corp wholly owning BSkyB will make it impossible for most other news organisations to compete in five to 10 years' time. There is another concern – the impact on Britain's important cultural and creative industries will be devastating. I know of at least one major US television group which decided not to invest in the UK. It is a ""post-mature"" market that in its view is now de facto controlled by the Murdoch family. The market is being given to him giftwrapped. OfCom recommended that the issues raised were so profound the bid should be referred to the Competition Commission, which at the very least implied months of delay and Murdoch having to pay a very much higher price even if he did get the go-ahead. But Mr Murdoch is a past master at running rings around our timorous politicians and hamstrung regulators. He bought the News of the World in 1969 exploiting every loophole in the take-over code. His agreement to co-run the paper with the ex-owner Sir William Carr lasted all of three months. He bought the Times and Sunday Times in 1981, avoided referral to the Monopolies Commission courtesy of Margaret Thatcher because the papers were loss-making, and agreed to run the titles with independent directors as custodians of impartial journalism, who soon were ignored. BSkyB was a tougher challenge, but as his mother once said, Rupert loves a challenge. Secretary of state for business Vince Cable unwittingly created the opening. He did not refer Richard Desmond's bid for Channel 5 for any plurality review in August (Desmond also owns Express newspapers). Then he was secretly recorded by Daily Telegraph journalists saying he was ""at war"" with Murdoch. Suddenly, this most litigious of businessman had a potential case for judicial review on grounds of bias if his bid was referred to the Competition Commission, as Jeremy Hunt, the secretary of state for culture, Olympics, media and sport, never fails to remind us. Murdoch was allowed to talk to the Office of Fair Trading to come up with a deal that would avoid being referred, thus reducing the risk of legal challenge. What a happy result for the Conservative party anxious to keep on the right side of him. Unsurprisingly, a deal is now near. The OFT is apparently insisting on a structural rather than a behavioural concession from Mr Murdoch – our regulators have learned something over the years. One option is the sale of Sky News, losing £40m, thus sustaining its independence, but to whom? In any case, Murdoch wants to continue owning it. The word on the street is that the OFT will accept a Times-plus solution; Sky News run by an independent trust, separate from the newspapers, but funded by News Corp. Plurality is preserved. So Murdoch will be both satisfied and irritated. He has given more ground than he did with the News of the World and the Times, but crucially he has retained ownership. Ownership means control and you do what you must to get it. Time goes by; commercial realities change; regulation is weak and sooner or later the owner can claim what is his or hers. Opinion on this is split. Media analyst Claire Enders, once a vociferous and influential critic, believes it is the best that could be hoped for within the current framework. That is a mighty condemnation of our rules. By 2015, BSkyB will account for half of UK TV revenues, spending little on UK content while controlling swaths of sports, film and archive rights. The US company deciding not to invest here will be the first of many. Capitalism delivers best when it is open, competitive and the powerful companies have to confront hungry challengers (Rupert Murdoch was himself a hungry young man 50 years ago). It becomes sclerotic and sleazy when it is run by insiders, monopolies and political fixes. And plurality? Who is to say that the next Communications Act will not remove the provision Rupert so detests? In which case, the OFT deal will be seen as just one more feeble and transient obstacle in the onward march of News Corp. British politicians of all persuasions identify being pro-business as agreeing to anything today's powerful businessmen want, without really understanding that the genius of capitalism is the opportunity it gives to the challenger and the outsider rather than protecting the interests of powerful incumbents. It is a weakness Murdoch has exploited to the full. For example, when bankers were negotiating Project Merlin, the deal in which they would agree to lend more if the government called off its attacks on bonuses and threats of more regulation, they also wanted an agreement to limit the Independent Commission on Banking's work and recommendations. Powerful incumbents were trying to protect their interests and the government, anxious to be ""pro-business"", was willing to oblige. I understand only the threatened resignation of chair Sir John Vickers and all his commissioners headed off the threat. We need to show some similar steel over the evolution of our creative industries and over questions of ownership and media cross-ownership more generally. In particular, Messrs Clegg, Huhne, Alexander and Cable must look each other in the eye. Mr Murdoch poses a profound question not just over our media, but more widely.

"Hello boys! You are more than welcome here. We expect you to be supportive but most men of intelligence already believe that women are at least equal to them and should be treated so. Or do they? Is it possible to be a male feminist? Does such as thing exist? Is it desirable? As Janice Erlbaum put it, ""Feminist men: oxymorons or simply morons?"" I ask, I guess, because in the last few weeks when I have expressed anger, I have inevitably been called a man-hater. The obvious response to this is, ""Men? Look at me! Can't get enough of them! Some of my best friends are . . ."" and then acknowledge that ""men"" may even have emotions. Will this do? Just saying, ""Yeah, some men are all right, really"" is all too reminiscent of those sleazy guys who claim to love all women but don't in reality appear to like them much. But yes, the truth is I do see lots of guys doing their bit. More and more. They don't make a huge song and dance about it. When my eldest was little, in the early 1990s, a man at the school gates was rare; with my youngest, you cannot move for guys being ""great dads"" or, if I want to be sour, simply doing what women have always done. But there they are. Not to acknowledge that men do more childcare or that some women are earning more than guys is disingenuous. To not acknowledge the support that some men give women is to be unkind. The most honest and pro-woman doctor I have ever seen was a bloke. Should I say otherwise? None of this, though, makes everything OK, and none of it makes feminism any less of a necessity. The raised male voices are increasingly those of men with strong anti-feminist views. The guys who just get on with it seem either unheard or unsure. So someone, like that peculiar MP Dominic Raab, can call feminists ""obnoxious bigots"" and know there will be ""hear hears"". We are fed a diet of women's rights having gone ""too far"", equal opportunities ""madness"" and ""batshit crazy"" political correctness. Yet these gross generalisations do not resonate with generations of younger men brought up by working mothers and surrounded by girls who will have equalled them intellectually. Yes, young men will have been raised with mixed messages about respecting women, but some genuinely do. Many admire independent women and the choices they make and do not want a doormat at all, but worry that should they speak up, they will sound submissive. The ghost of the ""new man"" stalks the land. This ever so self-righteous softer version of masculinity was partly created through sexual politics but really only existed so that advertisers could target a new market. The new man was only ever a phantom. Very few men were new. I vaguely recall some trying to behave a bit better in order to get off with more women. But the new man's nemesis, the ""lad"", soon took over to put everyone back in their place. While faking subversion, laddishness is simply what it says on the tin: a version of masculinity that cannot mature. It cannot actually live with itself. It withers on the vine (rehab) or lives in admiration of lost lads: Oliver Reed, George Best and Keith Moon. Post-feminism didn't require men to be anything more than the wielder of credit cards. Which is why it was scarcely politics at all. But weaving between the stereotypes have been alliances between gay men and women, and straight men and women trying simply to get by. Lots of people don't identify themselves with the F word, but they are preoccupied with trying to understand the relations between the genders. Our mutual suspicion is, in fact, another market. The self-help industry, apart from claiming to cure cancer with creative visualisation, also promises the equally implausible notion that men and women can live in harmony. This requires a certain amount of training and these books are basically manuals in how to operate the opposite sex . The market ain't dumb. Men's Health in America, hardly some Dworkinite hotbed of radicalism, has just started a feminist blog. Why? Its author says, ""I think a lot of people are probably feminist without even realising. It was an opportunity to create and open up dialogues for both sexes, dispel myths and negative connotations."" Wow! Men's Health, which we thought was the Bible of metrosexuality, is talking about feminism! The deputy editor of UK's Men Health is more wary: ""Our readers have awareness; we don't see the need to tag it as 'feminism'."" Once again the issue is not the issue, but the word. Men can think feminist thoughts, but let's not get carried away . . . Why is this so difficult? It is easy enough to say one is anti-racist. Why not the same with anti-sexism? Of course, there is a history of men being involved in the women's movement – some of it good, some of it hilariously awful. I remember guys turning up on pro-choice marches and insisting they be at the front ""to make an impact"". I remember working at a leftwing magazine where the boss thought that getting in touch with his own feelings meant spurting them all over you, and that any self-proclaimed feminist should be grateful for this. There were guys who went off into woods, men's movement-style, following the mytho-poetics of Robert Bly. And those who forced themselves to pee sitting down, or be a bit gay, or spend arduous hours ensuring their girlfriends had an orgasm, as if this would give them points on some revolutionary clubcard. There were the politics of self-actualisation, which tipped into therapy, mess and screaming. I once went to a conference in Birmingham where John Stoltenberg, author of Refusing to Be a Man, stood up and announced that he wasn't speaking as a man but ""as a penised individual"". Yes, really. But now I think, ""At least these guys spoke up."" Maybe one small reason I want men to speak up again is that I have spent too long in the blogosphere reading the works of Julian Assange's supporters. Let me say again, I do not know if this man is innocent or guilty of what he is charged with in Sweden. But I do know I have seen a massive amount of hatred of women. Or ""womanoids"", as some charmingly call us. We are guilty of just about everything, including creating an ""abuse industry"" funded by the NSPCC. I've read accounts from ""inside the mind of a sexual trade union feminist"". Some men go so far as to quote Pat Robertson, the American evangelist for whom feminism ""encourages women to leave their husbands, kill their children, practise witchcraft, destroy capitalism and become lesbians"". Anyone who believes in due process is a bunny-boiling whore or an operative for the CIA. So I have to remind myself that not all men think this way. Many would be appalled at the women in their lives being described in the ways I have seen. Where are the male voices to counter such misogyny? Are they scared of being patronised? Maybe. But worse could happen. Women have always patronised men. Who said, ""Though we adore men individually, we agree as a group they're rather stupid""? Yeah – that crazed radical Mary Poppins. So now, right now, when women are not well represented in politics, when the poorest are being forced back into dependence on men, when feminism is seen as having gone too far, is it impossible to ask men to speak up in support? Is it uncool? Anyway, what does a feminist man look like? How about Kurt Cobain, Peter Tatchell, Baaba Maal, Antony Hegarty, Bill Bailey, David Steele and Barak Obama as my team's starter for 10 . . . over to you guys.",What's the nicest thing a man can do for a woman?

"Who among the first evangelists of the internet foresaw this? When they gushingly described the still emerging technology as ""transformational"", it was surely the media or information, rather than political, landscapes they had in mind. And yet now it is the hard ground of the Middle East, not just our reading habits or entertainment options, that is changing before our eyes – thanks, at least in part, to the internet. Take the Tunisia uprising that started it all. Those close to it insist a crucial factor was not so much the WikiLeaks revelations of presidential corruption that I mentioned here last week, but Facebook. It was on Facebook that the now legendary Boazizi video – showing a vegetable seller burning himself to death – was posted, and on Facebook that subsequent demonstrations were organised. Who knows, if the people of Tunis one day build a Freedom Square, perhaps they'll make room for a statue of Mark Zuckerberg. If that sounds fanciful, note the Egyptian newborns named simply ""Facebook"". (Not that we should get carried away with the notion of internet as liberator: dictators have found it useful, too.) But what about the rest of us, those unlikely ever to go online to organise an insurrection? What has been the transformative effect on us? Or to borrow the title of the latest of many books chewing on this question, how is the internet changing the way you think? Given the subject I thought it wise to engage in a little light crowd-sourcing, floating that question on Twitter. As if to vindicate the ""wisdom of crowds"" thesis often pressed by internet cheerleaders, the range of responses mirrored precisely the arguments raised in the expert essays collected by editor John Brockman in the new book. There are the idealists, grateful for a tool that has enabled them to think globally. They are now plugged into a range of sources, access to which would once have required effort, expense and long delays. It's not just faraway information that is within reach, but faraway people – activists are able to connect with like-minded allies on the other side of the world. As Newsnight's Paul Mason noted recently: ""During the early 20th century people would ride hanging on the undersides of train carriages across borders just to make links like these."" It's this possibility of cross-border collaboration that has the internet gurus excited, as they marvel at open-source efforts such as the Linux computer operating system, with knowledge traded freely across the globe. Richard Dawkins even imagines a future when such co-operation is so immediate, so reflexive, that our combined intelligence comes to resemble a single nervous system: ""A human society would effectively become one individual,"" he writes. No less hopeful are the egalitarians who believe the internet, and social media in particular, have flattened the old hierarchies that put purveyors of information at the top of the pyramid and consumers down below. ""I think that social boundaries have become more porous,"" mused one tweeter. ""Without it I wouldn't be able to have this informal chat with you."" The end of deference is a theme, with several suggesting that where once they had to believe what they were told, they can now check for themselves. But in my unscientific survey the Pollyannas were outnumbered by the Cassandras, even among people whose Twitter habit might suggest internet zeal. There were laments for what more than one essayist in the anthology calls the ""outsourcing of the mind"". As a respondent to my Twitter appeal put it: ""Sadly I think less and google more."" Others raised the now hoary question of anonymity and its tendency to remove the usual social inhibitions that encourage courtesy. Just as the car windscreen makes people ruder than they would ever dare to be exposed as mere pedestrians, so the presence of a computer screen can release a darker side, coarsening relations between strangers. For reasons not yet fully understood, the internet seems to have robbed many of embarrassment. But these were mere side notes. The biggest complaint, in both my Twitter sample and the expert essays, was about the quality of thinking in the online era. What the internet has done, say the dissenters, is damage our ability to concentrate for sustained periods. Being connected meant being constantly tempted to look away, to hop from the text in front of you to another, newer one. One tweeter replied that he now thought ""about more things for shorter amounts of time. It's like ADHD."" Anyone who has Tweetdeck fitted on their desktop, chirruping like a toddler tapping you on the shoulder urging you to come and play, will know what he means. This, the worriers fear, is not just irritating; it might even damage our civilisation. How capable will people be of creating great works if they are constantly interrupted, even when alone? ""What the net seems to be doing is chipping away my capacity for concentration and contemplation,"" angsts Nicholas Carr, who believes the internet is steering us toward ""the shallows"". Now there are even devices available that limit internet access to prevent you getting too distracted. The writer Jay Rayner responded to my poll by confessing he'd recently rented a house with no connection to get some work done, adding that the internet ""actively stops me thinking"". And he's not the only one to have taken such drastic action. But it goes beyond mere distraction. The nature of the work itself changes. One tweeter complained of the internet producing ""Pot Noodle knowledge"", instant and thin. The online bias toward the immediate is strong, forcing us into a permanent ""now"", weakening our sensitivity to the past and even to the future. If John F Kennedy urged us to have two separate in-trays on our desks – one marked ""urgent"" and the other ""important"" – the internet is blurring the distinction. The impact of all this is not confined to the quality of intellectual inquiry. It's affecting family life, too. I recall the friend who saw a counsellor for advice about his disruptive children. Diagnosis: they were playing up to wrest attention from parents who had one eye forever on the BlackBerry. Some couples report tension, with one constantly tweeting while watching television or even during dinner. That's not so much a third person in the marriage as an entire crowd. The result, says essayist Douglas Rushkoff, is that the internet has made him ""resentful and short-fused"", stressed by the pressure to be available and to respond now. ""It's as if the relentless demand of networks for me to be everywhere, all the time, were denying me access to the moment in which I am really living,"" he writes plaintively. But he has a valuable insight. It's not the internet itself that's doing this. It's the advent particularly of mobile technology, of the smartphone, turning the internet from an occasional, ""opt-in"" activity to what Rushkoff calls an ""'always on' condition of my life"". The internet is no longer just on your desk, but in your pocket, nagging you to stop what you're doing and pay attention. We cannot turn back time. Nor, given the internet's power for good currently on display around the Middle East, should we want to. But we need to reassert control. We need, in short, to rediscover the off switch.",We owe the internet for changing the world. Now let's learn how to turn off | Jonathan Freedland,2011-02-22T21:00:00Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"Churchill's decision to return Britain to the gold standard on budget day April 1925 was one of the most mistaken decisions in our economic history. Six years of misery would follow the then chancellor's decision before an unstoppable run on the pound in summer 1931 forced the link with gold to be broken. Finance's triumph over industry was complete. Churchill would later bitterly regret his decision, but the decisive influence was Montagu Norman, governor of the Bank of England, who has passed into legend as a high priest of irrational financial and fiscal rectitude and who thus politicised the Bank of England as the enemy of the common people. The gold standard was divine, he told Churchill. Only last week shadow chancellor Ed Balls invoked Norman's memory to criticise his successor today – Mervyn King – for making a mistake of parallel magnitude. For the gold standard now read King's unhesitating backing, repeated again on Wednesday, for the coalition government's commitment to eliminate Britain's structural budget deficit in four years. King is becoming as dangerously politicised as Norman, argues Balls, and with results that will prove no less calamitous. Nobody can yet say whether Balls will be proved right on the economy – I think it is probable – but the closer analogy is that the financial quandary Britain found itself in 1925, just as in 2011, is at root not about technical judgments about interest rates and exchange rates. It is about declining British economic power interacting with big international challenges, cornering the Bank of England and forcing political interventions from its governor. For Norman was not alone in 1925. He, along with the military and Foreign Office elite – and with central bankers in France, Germany and the US – saw Britain's return to the gold standard as the only way of holding the international system together and thus preventing descent into another war. Norman knew that the economic cost to Britain would be acute. But unless London could assume its role as banker to the world's international financial system based on gold – the only standard they could then imagine on which to anchor currencies – there could be no order. But Britain did not have the economic muscle to sustain this role, with results we all know. King's choices are no less invidious. He is in the middle of two rows that although apparently technical are really about economic decline – one over his backing for the coalition's draconian budgetary measures and the other over the Bank of England's refusal to raise interest rates despite persistently high inflation. Britain does not have a strong enough economy to adapt to the rise of Asia without importing inflation, nor does it have an economy large enough to underwrite the risks of its vast internationalised banking sector. But Britain also wants to keep an independent currency just as it wanted to be centre of the gold standard in 1925. The ambition simultaneously to have a stable independent currency, low inflation and a banking system on an international scale is as impossible in 2011 as our ambitions were in 1925. And the buck stops with the Bank of England, forcing the governor into highly charged politicised policy interventions. Take inflation. As King himself has acknowledged, prices have been rising faster than wages for years so that wages in real terms will be no higher in 2011 than they were in 2006, and that is set to continue in 2012. In other words, there will be a six-year freeze on living standards, the longest in British history since the return to the gold standard in 1925. The Resolution Foundation has detailed the impact on the 6 million lower- and middle-income households in Britain whose average net household income is £20,300 a year and who spend disproportionally more on the goods going up fastest in price. A fifth are now materially deprived and over half have savings worth less than a month's wages. Only the seriously better-off are now escaping the squeeze. If Britain had a diversified economy or was a member of a currency zone such as the euro, it could pay higher wages to the bulk of its people to compensate, but that is not our position. As it is, our workers are having to use their slowly growing wages to pay ever-higher prices in depreciating pounds for scarcer food and fuel whose prices are being driven up by the rapidly industrialising countries of Asia. It may be that retail price inflation hits 6% or even 7% in the months ahead, but none of this is coming from a domestic wage and price spiral or ballooning credit. Apart from the rise in VAT, it is being imported from abroad, exacerbated by the fall in the pound. At the same time, the country is being hit by the deficit reduction programme that King backs from the particular vantage point of worrying about the size of Britain's banking sector. If there were another banking crisis – nearly certain given the lack of reform – King knows that Britain must have the head room to bail out its banks. International investors will thus only have medium-term confidence in sterling if the national debt is at the average or low end of the international league table. So he has to prioritise rapid deficit reduction with its potentially dangerous impact on a faltering economy. But the price is that any rise in interest rates to curb inflation becomes much more risky. All he can do is indulge the rise in prices, not lifting interest rates, and stand by chancellor George Osborne, even if the price is near mutiny from some inflation hawks on the Monetary Policy Committee and attacks from Ed Balls about his politicisation. To change the equation, there have to be some transformational moves. If Britain wants to stay outside the euro, it has to have a smaller and safer banking sector. The independent banking commission is charged to examine how, terrifying the bankers. Meanwhile, the stresses on the integrity of the Monetary Policy Committee are becoming acute as it becomes obvious that, given Britain's options, the Bank has to ignore the government's inflation target of 2%. One committee member, Adam Posen, has said that King is ""excessively political"": another, Andrew Sentance, has talked emotionally of the refusal to act on inflation as tantamount to selling the country ""by the pound"". Central bankers, whether King or Norman, are, in the end, prisoners of bigger forces. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls is right to warn of the echoes of the dramatic 1920s and 30s. His criticisms would be even more telling if he entered the lists and explained he understands Britain's existential choices, notably over its banking sector, and how he would resolve them.","And as people get poorer, the buck stops with you, Mervyn King | Will Hutton",2011-02-20T00:06:33Z,Will Hutton,uk
"Pity Lindsay Lohan – how bad do things have to get for drug-addled, porn-addicted, wife-beater Charlie Sheen to feel the urge to proffer life advice, in this case to try to ""control her impulses"" or, as Sheen doubtless put it to the reporter: ""Yraggh, ussssh, unk, gimme some crack, GRAARRR!""? Well, we've all had nights out like that, though for Charlie, this was probably Tuesday morning. He's such a bad boy, isn't he? The baddest! Sexy, isn't it, ladies? He's living the dream, isn't he, guys? If anyone answered ""yes"" to these questions, please smother yourself with a pillow for the good of humanity now. It seems to be bad boy season right now – ""caddish"" Charles Spencer snaring yet another fiancee, Shane Warne upsetting Liz Hurley, Berlusconi… being Berlusconi. However, all of them are drips, amateurs, compared with Charlie. Sheen ended up in rehab twice recently (drugs, alcohol, porn stars, violence, hospitalisation, all the classics). His top-rating show, Two and a Half Men, was temporarily postponed while he got better. Better? Sheen resembles a startled gosling that's just crawled out of Charles Bukowski's left nostril or a haunted scarecrow from a Stephen King story. His smile looks like the broken zip from hell. Does this pass for ""better"" in Hollywood these days? I thought: ""I should feel sympathy for him"" (let (s)he who casts the first stone, etc). Despite being a multimillionaire, Sheen is clearly a sick idiot, who views sex and celebrity as an extreme sport. However, I tend to make a point of not feeling sorry for bad boys such as Sheen. And that's because I don't want to indulge and encourage them. It's the equivalent of saying: ""Go ahead, bad boy, make another woman's life hell."" I'm not even sure I buy into all the Charlie Sheen myth-making. If he really was that perma-intoxicated, he wouldn't be copulating with porn stars, he'd be urinating all over himself. Some other myths? Bad boys are funny, charming, wild, a rollercoaster ride (sigh!), not like other men. In Sheen's case, would this be ""partying"" with a porn star, while his former wife, Denise Richards, slept a few rooms away with his children? (Adorable!) Threatening another wife with a knife. (A keeper!) Or ranting at Richards when her mother was dying from cancer: ""Go cry to your bald mother, you fucking loser!"" (Hot!) Sheen comes across as the worst kind of diehard misogynist, modelled from a Mel Gibson Shaker Maker kit. And what happens? He's idolised. Paid millions. Elsewhere, even non-famous bad boys are encouraged to think that they're Marlon Brando in Streetcar, the untamed real deal. All this admiration, not just from other men, but from women, too. One thinks: what is it about these self-hating women that they flatter and indulge these horrors? It is tantamount to gender betrayal. Someone once told me that, subliminally at least, everything men do, or dream of doing, from climbing mountains to making millions, even to pulling their fingers and comedy farting, is to impress women. Could it be that some men look up to men like Charlie because they think women want men like Charlie? This results in behaviour in the general ""Charlie"" spectrum, which leads (ta-da!) to a lot of unhappy women and probably children, too. Is this what women are doing when they simper over bad boys – turning the female talent for self-loathing into an everyday hell for the women who actually end up dealing with them? Those women who are ""into bad boys"" really should get over it, or at least stop broadcasting it. Remember that men sometimes actually listen to what we say, try to guess what we want, with the tragic outcome that Charlie Sheen syndrome becomes our fault, too. Watch out, Barack Obama, your children will come back to haunt you Never mind the dreary Brit awards (it says something when they have to set people on fire onstage to keep the audience awake) – Kim Jong-Choi, North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il's son, has been spotted on the razz again. I say ""on the razz"" – he actually went to an Eric Clapton concert in Singapore. The same Clapton he saw playing in Germany five years ago. Around that time, Kim Jong-il decided his son was ""too effeminate"" to rule. Steady on, Pops, this is Slowhand, not Lady Gaga. As Kim Jong-Choi has pierced ears and wears a lot of black, it might be more accurate to dismiss him as ""too emo to rule"" or perhaps ""too goth to govern"". Going to Clapton's gig doesn't seem so bad, unless your dad rules the single party state, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. (Oops, he does!) That's kids for you – always showing you up. This is the brilliant thing about political families – there is nearly always one child who rips off the mask of contrived ultra-respectability. Ronald Reagan's daughter, Patti, grassed up Daddy for being senile. Then there is Sarah Palin's teen-mom, ice-skating daughter, Bristol. And Carol and Mark Thatcher, Maggie suffering the mortifying progeny double whammy. What is it about political kids and their talent for sabotage? There the parent is, on the world stage, wielding vast international power, then along come their resentful, gum-chewing brats to screw everything up. It's a Wizard of Oz moment: curtains whisked back to reveal the all-powerful political whizzes for what they really are – exhausted parents with embarrassing, out-of-control kids. The Obama girls are adorable, but give them time. That little one has a glint in her eye… Dimbleby's got it right. No question Why is David Dimbleby accused of being a prima donna for his refusal to drag himself up to Glasgow for weekly production meetings for Question Time? Staff will now have to fly back to London to brief him, at the licence payers' expense, but this isn't Dimbleby's fault. The BBC is moving Question Time to Glasgow because of its target of 50% of network spending outside of London by 2016. However, Question Time is a political programme that surely has a right to remain, as Dimbleby put it, ""around the swirl of Westminster life"". As Question Time travels to a different locale around Britain each week, his stand can't be dismissed as London-centric snobbery or laziness. If you're prepared to sit in a provincial town hall on a weekday evening, with the likes of Nigel Farange sharing your water jug, no one could doubt your commitment. Likewise, calls for him to be replaced are ludicrous. Question Time without Dimbleby would be like Coronation Street without the cobbles. The truth is that Dimbleby is probably doing what many of his colleagues afflicted by the changes want to do (editor Ed Havard has already resigned over the issue). If filming for a particular programme has to be relocated, that's different, but expecting personnel to move around for the sake of a few production meetings is unfair and bizarre. One supposes there's always Skype, if the BBC really wants to torture the presenter. However, to me, this isn't about Dimbleby regally opining: ""The mountain must come to Muhammad."" Rather, it's a case of: ""The mountain is being an overbearing, corporate jobsworth, insisting on change for change's sake."" David Dimbleby's obstinacy rather becomes him.",Idolising bad boys makes Charlies of us all | Barbara Ellen,2011-02-20T00:06:25Z,Barbara Ellen,world
"Falsies have become my preoccupation. But clearly not just mine. I could buy a mascara called Falsies to give myself ""the ultimate false lash glam look"". But why do that when I could just wear enormous false eyelashes? Or, better still, spend a small fortune on lash extensions, which hopefully wouldn't fall off for a few weeks if tended lovingly. It all seems a lot of time and energy, really. On the train or at the supermarket I see many young girls with long, spidery, glittery lashes, even when in their uniforms. I quite like this overalls-and-drag-queen look. I like the lack of pretence that this is real. But how did we get here, I wonder – to this new aesthetic of femininity where everything is meant to look as fake as possible? Hair, nails, tan, teeth, tits. Sure, I know the rules: that we are born naked, and ""the rest is just drag"". Sure, I get the hyper-femininity of the big queens and the game old birds such as Dolly Parton and Cher. What is strange is that a parody of femininity is now what many ordinary women are aspiring to. There was time when falsies were the pads shoved down your bra to make your breasts seem bigger, a kind of comedy stuffing. Now the stuffing is put directly inside the flesh, in the form of silicon implants. While not as cheap as chips, false breasts are certainly becoming as common as them. The ""boob job"" industry is massive. Boom boom. And everyday. Cosmetic surgery was once only the province of the rich, famous and deluded. It was surely another era when I was ferried to an American TV studio to debate with the legendary Betty Friedan and some daft woman who was claiming that her breast enlargement was a political act. A grouchy Freidan keep shouting into my ear: ""So she thinks she can buy big bazookas, right?"" It was a struggle to explain I was on Friedan's side, and now I wonder if anyone would even bother with this discussion. The political language of empowerment about reproductive rights and equality in the workplace has itself been given a makeover. Gok Wan makes women feel better not by giving them more actual control, but by giving them control pants. As the inimitable satire website The Onion once wrote, women ""are now empowered by everything that the typical woman does"". From driving the kids to school to eating energy bars! ""Owning and wearing dozens of pairs of shoes is a compelling way for a woman to announce that she is strong and independent and can shoe herself without the help of a man."" This is satire? Only just, says this humourless feminist. Buying stuff is the way our culture encourages us to believe we have some kind of power. When it all goes wrong and we have bought the wrong stuff, then we discuss the morality of it all. The woman who died recently after having industrial silicone injected into her buttocks was a sad case of someone buying the wrong stuff. The moral of this story seems to be: next time you are having buttock implants, get a reputable surgeon. It's the same with Botox, liposuction , tummy tucks and all the rest of it. People get ""work done"". Most discussion centres on whether that work has been done well, not whether it should have been done at all. The kind of feminism that espoused looking ""natural"" has pretty much lost the argument about body image. It was hardly ever going to be a fair match: some activist women against an entire military-industrial-cosmetic complex geared up towards getting us to commodify our own bodies. That's right. I am not saying that men do not objectify the female body, but now the gaze we direct at ourselves, at each other and in the mirror is a harsh one, too. It is sexualised in that we see what the body could become, as well as what it is. It is the gaze of search and destroy, and it certainly affects the inner lives of those who are not perfect. Which is a fair few of us. Heath, happiness and relationships are secondary to what Catherine Hakim provocatively calls ""erotic capital"". This is the basic ""if you've got it, flaunt it"" model to wave in the face of feminism. It doesn't wind me up particularly. What is key here is who defines erotic capital, and how. Today's templates of beauty for women are very samey, but they rarely occur in nature. The tall, slim-hipped figure with huge, pert breasts – basically the body of a Brazilian transsexual – was sought after for a while. Now we are told bottoms are making a comeback (where HAVE they been all these years?). These things are spoken about it in vacuum, as if we are not allowed to talk about the racial aspects of ""the bootylicious"". Increasingly, surgery cuts across race, gender and age alike. The girl in Miami has a nose job just as the woman in Tehran does. Signs of ethnicity can be erased, other signifiers or ""capital"" can be purchased. And once you have made a purchase, you want people to see that you have. The fashion – or indeed fetish – for fakery means women are actually asking surgeons to make their implants look as fake as their tans. Certainly, the way to counter what is going on here has to be strategic. One way is to promote a diversity of body shapes and all kinds of beauty. Susie Orbach is launching an Endangered Species International Summit. The purpose of this is to ""challenge the culture that teaches girls and women to hate their own bodies"". Who could argue with that? For it is the entire culture, not a male conspiracy, that is making impossible demands. Yet none of this is simple. Artificially enhanced femininity is on display everywhere. Older women pay to look younger. Young women start altering themselves very early on. One result is a kind of glazed uniformity. You see it in porn. You see it in all those late-30s, Botoxed faces that look neither old nor young, just done. Somehow, though, something else is going on that is blowing apart any idea of ""the natural"". Some women are not saying, ""this is what I really look like"", rather they are saying, ""enjoy the performance"". Just as a drag queen would. The media then scrutinises this performance of femininity entirely as a construction. This radical idea – that gender is constructed – is being acted out in all this fakery. But as an aesthetic, depoliticised ""style"". Lady Gaga may sing Born This Way, while clearly demonstrating with her hard body – complete with internal shoulder pads/prosthesis/spare ectoplasm – that she wasn't, that this is all an act. A look that has comes to us via porn, ladyboys, transsexuals, queer culture and high fashion is a look I now see on the bus. This excess of femininity may compensate for endless anxiety about appearances. There is nothing natural going on here, and some women are not hiding that fact. To become a woman is to become a female impersonator. How, in such a world, can we say to any young girl: ""You are fine just as you are""?",Why does nobody want to feel like a natural woman any more? | Suzanne Moore,2011-02-19T09:01:00Z,Suzanne Moore,world
"   'The Sage of Baltimore': US journalist, essayist and wit HL Mencken (1880-1956), in 1949. Photograph: Getty Images/Hulton Archive    Are you Beatles or Beethoven? Chelsea or Arsenal? Mencken or Montaigne? You can supposedly tell people by their taste in fads and gurus. In the case of columnists there is a clear choice. Sensitive, cerebral, me-me writers go for Montaigne, the 16th-century sage of Bordeaux. Rat fink reporter types go for the scourge of Baltimore, HL Mencken, whose collected Prejudices have just been published. Montaigne was a sceptic and bon viveur. He detested religious violence and was suspicious of what romantic love did to the power of reason. He also opposed colonising the new world as cruel to the natives. From his French manor he poured out homespun wisdom, earning encomiums from the late Bernard Levin. ""Nothing is so firmly believed as that which is least known,"" he declared. He intrigued himself with, ""When I play with my cat, who knows if I am not more of a pastime to her than she is to me?"" His classic epigram was: ""We may walk on stilts but we are still walking on our own legs: on the highest throne in the world, we sit only on our own bottom."" I am sure Montaigne grows with age, but I am for Mencken. He was in the macho American literary tradition of Perelman, Frost, Hemingway and Dorothy Parker. He was raucous, bibulous, lecherous and with a genius for showing an equal contempt for the common man and those in power. In the echoing pantheon of his mind, there were few heroes. Of the hated President Coolidge he wrote, ""at least Nero fiddled, Coolidge snored"". Woodrow Wilson, was not just bad, he was ""the self-bamboozling Presbyterian … the perfect model of the Christian cad, a cold and treacherous moraliser"". Wilson had involved America in the first world war on the side of the dastardly British who, by fighting the war, Mencken held responsible for the rise of Hitler. Mencken's other hates were respectability, poetry that ""only Christian Scientists can understand"" and Washington DC and its ""umbilicari, the booboisie"", on whose lips the word honour, ""save for the structural integrity of women, has only comic significance"". He was once upset by some farmer getting a subsidy. He did not just disagree. ""Let the farmer be damned forevermore! To hell with him and bad luck to him! He is a tedious fraud and ignoramus, a cheap rogue and hypocrite, the eternal Jack of the human pack … indeed no more grasping, selfish, dishonest mammal is known to students of the Anthropoidea."" Oh, and he forgot to mention, the farmer was also a ""prehensile moron"". There were few loves in Mencken's life, apart from women – ""we squeeze what we can from this strange mess called life"" – but they were passionate. They included the city of Baltimore, the writer Willa Cather, and classical music, especially German composers. He adored any music except jazz, equating the bashing out of column on the typewriter with playing the piano, ""apart from the flats"". He was said to have filed his typewriter keys into stilettos. Mencken did not write, but rather hacked words from the cliff of the English language and set them on a column in his beloved paper, the Baltimore Sun. Each one was unveiled with the blast of an ecstatic trumpet and a puff from an enormous cigar. His political maxims became bywords: ""Democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want, and deserve to get it good and hard."" ""The worst government is the most moral … when fanatics are on top there is no limit to oppression."" Most famous of all was: ""No one has ever lost money underestimating the intelligence of the masses."" Mencken was a product of the old American high school uncorrupted – unlethargised, he would say – by college. He learned his prose from that finest of literary academies, a newspaper news desk. He would take a great bleeding hunk of fact and bash it, salt it, pepper it and roast it within an inch of its life. He then doused it with a sauce of verbal invention, with great splashes of colour. Sometimes a Mencken column went on for pages, and woe betide the subeditor who cut him. Sometimes he said what was needed in five paragraphs, and left the sub with acres of white space to fill. Many of Mencken's words, like Shakespeare's, were fashioned afresh for the sheer sound of them. There was hunkerous, punctilio, oedematous, Mariolatry, usufruct. He wrote so many epigrams it was hard not to invent them for him. Google records that I myself added to the Mencken lexicon by wrongly attributing to him the maxim that, at elections, we should always ""Chuck the rapscallions out"". As he grew older the maestro was dogged by the question that afflicts all columnists: Why on earth am I doing this? What conceivable use are my views to anyone else? I should shut up and mind the garden. Mencken's excuse was that he wanted ""simply to find out what I was thinking … to provide a kind of catharsis for my thoughts. They worry me until they are set forth in words"". He concluded it was probably ""a sign of insanity"", though he comforted himself that it was free of moral purpose. He hated both prohibition and puritanism, ""the haunting fear that someone, somewhere, may be happy"". When the age of Mencken passed, many felt that the column would be followed by nothing but news. I remember predictions in the early 80s that all readers would one day want from the media would be football gossip, racing results and stock market prices, with perhaps some blood and thunder from the Old Bailey. Why should anyone wallow in someone else's mental bathwater? The answer today is given in millions of words of columns, billions of blogs and tweets, and newscasts that are closer to editorials than to stories. The reason cannot just be the perversion of CP Scott's maxim, that comment is free and facts expensive. There is clearly something in argument and debate that deepens understanding. As Mencken would have said, free opinion directs the boot of truth at the crotch of power, and the more it hurts the better. Half a century after his death, news is the endangered species. Opinion – raw, cruel, unguarded, outrageous, euphonious, cacophonous opinion – is what is riding high.",Opinion directs the boot of truth at the crotch of power.

"     A choice passage from the coalition agreement, to which not nearly enough attention has been paid: ""We will review employment and workplace laws, for employers and employees, to ensure they maximise flexibility for both parties while protecting fairness and providing the competitive environment required for enterprise to thrive."" The warmer words in that sentence now seem flimsy, to say the least. If you want a more precise flavour of where things are headed, consider one of David Cameron's recent prescriptions for economic success, lacking any such cuddliness, and echoed in an answer at yesterday's prime minister's questions: the righteous path, he reckons, is all about ""reducing regulation and maintaining a flexible and dynamic labour market"". What that means is obvious enough: for millions, the same deepening insecurity they experienced under the last government, and then some. Vince Cable's business department has plans to make access to employment tribunals more difficult, cheered on by such friends of the worker as Boris Johnson, lately heard decrying their ""barminess"". The CBI howls, as ever, about other red tape. Meanwhile the pushing of more and more work from the public to private sector shreds plenty of protection, the growth of temporary and agency work continues apace, and rising unemployment pushes wages and conditions further downward. The essential reality of our times is captured in a socio-economic term coined by the academic Guy Standing, and used for the title of his imminent new book, The Precariat: The New Dangerous Class. No wonder this week's inflation figures showed prices rising twice as fast as average pay. If the near-silent, gap-toothed street that leads from the station to the centre of town is anything to go by, Swansea is as threadbare an embodiment of hard times as you could imagine. Heavily reliant on the public sector, it faces a three-way knot of problems: the axe falling on government jobs, poor prospects for local business and the key consequence of the ""flexibility"" gospel – that any new jobs will be uncertain and insecure. And the average local hourly rate? ""Just above the minimum wage – not great at all,"" one man tells me. ""I'm sure there are jobs that pay higher,"" offers a NHS staffer on £7 an hour, ""but I can't seem to find any."" A young woman who's an office receptionist on around £6 an hour tells me her outgoings have lately increased by £100 a month, and her weekly budget leaves only £40 for anything more than travel to work, rent and bills – including food. To everyone I speak to, the combination of stagnating pay and rising cost of living seems cruel and increasingly unmanageable. At the council refuse depot I meet Ian Alexander and his two colleagues. As litter pickers they get £6.30 an hour, with a £54 a week bonus. The latter may soon go, thanks to the council's belated embrace of equal pay: as in many places, it looks like resulting in a levelling down for men rather than appreciable improvements for women. Meanwhile the workforce is made anxious by ever-increasing numbers of agency workers, employed on inferior terms, who come and go at speed. In rubbish collection, one man tells me, they may number 70% of employees. Among those on fixed contracts the impression is of privatisation by stealth. ""There's so much uncertainty – I dread to think where we're going to be in three years' time,"" says Alexander, a former steelworker. And this picture is not restricted to unskilled work, or the more blighted parts of the country. When we appealed for information and testimony about low pay, worsening conditions and ever-tightening budgets from readers of Comment is free, responses came back by the score, seemingly covering all corners of Britain, both public and private sectors, and most parts of the economy. ""I've not received a pay rise in nearly three years,"" wrote one poster. ""I earn a little above the minimum wage. On this I have to support myself and my chronically ill partner."" Another said: ""We had our salaries reduced by 10% 18 months ago after two rounds of redundancies at my firm. I am lucky to have very little responsibility outside of looking after myself and my partner … a child or even a larger house would completely cripple us. Following rent, tax, bills and basic living costs, I am left with practically nothing to actually live life on. I have to claim housing benefit just to afford living in my one-bedroom flat."" A set of telling numbers from another contributor, who has children, ran as follows: ""My partner is facing a 5% pay cut, and for less money they are going to ask him to work an extra 15 hours a week so they can make redundancies. He already works 45, so he has to choose between 10 hours a day, six days a week, or eight-ish hour days, seven days a week."" And what about this: ""My son is working fulltime as a painter on the Olympics site. He is paid £42 per day plus £5 daily ""bonus"" if he is on time. He loses the whole week's bonus (£25) if he is late on one day. ""He has not received any pay rise since completing his apprenticeship, though he has repeatedly asked about his situation. He is expected to buy all his own painting equipment. ""To arrive at his place of work by 8am he leaves home every day at 6.30am. He has to take three different forms of transport to get to work, and I have to subsidise his living costs because he is so low-paid. I hardly need point out that this company is non-unionised."" Such are the wonders of all that dynamism and flexibility, and an economic model with a rotten promise at its core.

"They say that if failure is an orphan, then success has many fathers – and Egypt's revolution has proved the truth of that aged wisdom all over again. The latest to file a paternity claim is Donald Rumsfeld, defence secretary to George W Bush. Out hawking his new memoir, Known and Unknown, Rumsfeld reckons it was Bush's ""freedom agenda"" that paved the way for the current revolutionary spirit sweeping the Arab world. ""What President Bush has done in Iraq and Afghanistan is to give the people in those countries a chance to have freer political systems and freer economic systems. There's no question that the example is helpful in the region."" In this, Rumsfeld was a little late to the party. His neoconservative outriders had already been making the case even more forcefully. In the Washington Post Charles Krauthammer took the near-universal admiration for the crowds in Tahrir Square as belated endorsement of the Bush programme. Where once Bush, Tony Blair and the neocons stood alone, now ""it seems everyone, even the left, is enthusiastic for Arab democracy"", wrote Krauthammer, adding generously: ""Fine. Fellow travellers are welcome."" In Britain Melanie Phillips has expressed astonishment at the sight of progressives backing the Egyptian demands for regime change: hadn't these same ""bien-pensants"" denounced the Bush-Blair pursuit of regime change in Iraq? There could only be one explanation for this sudden change of heart: the left opposed the removal of Saddam because he was anti-western, but supported the ejection of Hosni Mubarak because he was pro-western. Er, no. That's not quite it. Those who cheered last week's upheaval in Cairo did so because it was a revolution from within, driven entirely by the Egyptian people, and because it was conducted by peaceful means. To put it too mildly, neither of those two conditions applied in Baghdad in 2003. A foreign invasion and an internal, grassroots uprising are not the same thing: it is perfectly possible to oppose one and support the other. Nor can the Bush defenders get away with rewriting the history of the former president's ""freedom agenda"", pursued most vigorously in the first two years of his second term. Those who criticised it did not do so because they believed that Arabs were, in Krauthammer's words, ""uniquely allergic to democracy"". The objection was to a Bush mission fatally tainted by the conquest of Iraq: after the 2003 war, any talk from him of spreading democracy sounded like a threat of invasion. People yearned for freedom, to be sure; they just didn't believe it was best imposed down the barrel of a gun. What's more, the ""freedom agenda"" was always damagingly selective. While Bush urged democracy in, say, Iran, Dick Cheney was lavishing praise on the dictator of Kazakhstan. To those despots who favoured the west Washington showed a blind eye – with Mubarak himself the prime example. Indeed, some of us were arguing in the Guardian in February 2003 that if Bush were serious about spreading democracy to the Middle East, he needn't go to the trouble of invading Iraq: he could start with Egypt, tying America's billion-dollar handouts to the country to ""democratic performance"", making the cash conditional on Cairo allowing a free press, independent judiciary and real elections. Besides, the Bush team itself didn't truly believe in the ""freedom agenda"". Already cooling on the idea when Mubarak responded to Washington's pretty tame requests for reform with a middle finger, they gave it up once they saw where democracy could lead: having called for Palestinian elections in 2006, they recoiled at the sight of a Hamas victory. We heard a little less about freedom and democracy after that. All of which makes it a little rich for Rumsfeld and friends to claim that Tahrir Square provides them with delayed vindication. If Bush and Bushism had any role in last week's upheaval it was negative, continuing to prop up a dictator so hated his people rose up to remove him. Who then has a better paternity claim for the change in Cairo and beyond, besides, of course, the people in the streets themselves? Julian Assange could make a decent case, arguing that it was his WikiLeaks revelations of the Tunisian first couple's corruption and luxury lifestyle that inspired revolution in that country, sparking the fire that spread next to Egypt and appears to have taken hold in Yemen, Iran and Bahrain, where the same chant that once rang around Tahrir Square has been heard once more: ""We demand the fall of the regime."" The most starry-eyed Democrats will want to notch this up as a win for Barack Obama, pointing to his landmark 2009 speech in Cairo and to the simple chronological fact that these revolutions have taken place on his watch. More neutral participants give him credit for making it as clear as he could to a longstanding ally that Mubarak had to go – even over the opposition of some of his own team, including the US special envoy to Egypt. Still, those mixed signals alone ensure that few will recall last Friday's event as the Obama revolution. More pressing than the allocation of credit is the question of what those outside the region can do if they want to see reform entrenched in Tunisia and Egypt and spread beyond. We know that bombing doesn't work too well – but nor does love-bombing. If the west, especially the US, backs dissenters too loudly, that allows a regime to cast them as foreign agents and traitors. That was one lesson of the crushed uprising in Iran in the summer of 2009. Robin Niblett, director of Chatham House, told me he's reached the glum conclusion that if western governments want to help the Iranian opposition, the best they can do is stay well away. ""I wouldn't even touch Iran. All you do is strengthen the regime."" Instead, the west should look to enable, rather than to do, exercising what foreign policy circles think of as soft or smart power, rather than hard, military might. The aim should be to nurture what Niblett calls ""the infrastructure of representative government"" – the rule of law, a free press and judiciary, parliament – in countries that currently lack the democratic basics. That way, if and when revolution comes, it will have a chance to dig in, take root and survive. Obviously that won't work with avowedly hostile regimes: Iran and Syria won't allow foreign teams to come in and start training police or judges. But the west has leverage over the likes of Morocco or Jordan: as allies, they will find it harder to say no. This can't be a task for the US alone. The European Union can contribute too: after all, soft power is what we're meant to be good at. Right now, it is the peoples themselves who are rising up and demanding freedom. Our job is to stop backing the tyrants who have oppressed them – and to lend a hand where we can help. That would be a freedom agenda worthy of the name.","A better way to push democracy, but the west's love-bombing has risks too  | Jonathan Freedland",2011-02-15T21:00:00Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"It's National Marriage Week, apparently. Life is just one long honeymoon! I can't say it's affected me much because every week is bleedin' National Marriage Week, as far as I can tell. Promoting the idea of marriage as a dream of sexual and emotional fulfilment is the white noise of our culture. When my eldest was a toddler she put on a white crash helmet and went round shouting: ""I want to be dried! I want to be dried."" Was she mentally disturbed? She meant ""bride"", as it turned out. Where did she get this information from, I asked desperately, because I did not exactly live in a world of white weddings. ""It's just there,"" said a wise woman, ""kids pick up these things through osmosis."" Nonetheless, Iain Duncan Smith, the archbishop of Canterbury, the chief rabbi and Anne Atkins, among others, got themselves to the Palace of Westminster to inspire us to get married and, even better, to stay married. What a palaver! If marriage is so damn wonderful, why does any institution or faith or government need to prop it up, explain commitment or reward us with tax breaks? Surely, a good marriage is its own reward. But not in a material world. And that's what it's about. There remains a huge demand from the right that the state do more to support marriage. Those who fetishise tax breaks for marriage are often the same people who want the state to keep its nose out of our personal lives. As we know, David Cameron believes in less state and more society: Big Society or High Society, or something. The problem is really Low Society, where people breed for benefits. When I say people, I mean women who get impregnated and then ""marry"" the state. I married the state once myself. Predictably, it didn't last, so I ended up divorcing it and got a job! No one denies there are massive flaws with the benefit system, though the amount that benefit fraud costs is as nothing compared to corporate fraud. Having raised the problem of Broken Britain, the solution is vaguely Big Society or more specifically, Big Marriage. Tory doctrine remains in peculiar denial about what causes the broken families they so abhor. There are two separate issues. One concerns the people who don't get married in the first place. The other is divorce. Duncan Smith has met some poor people and has seen that there is little reason for women to stay with men who have no work and contribute little. Generations of workless males mean, at best, men are treated as an extra, more burdensome child. The obvious answer is to provide training and jobs that give young fathers a sense of responsibility. However, as a carrot – this idealised state of marriage – can't work when the raw marriage material is nonexistent. So we get the stick. Benefit cuts to women and children. Marriage is the glue that should paper over the cracks in this system, but how can it? The Tory concept of marriage is over – determined, as a Marxist might say. But marriages fail not because people have read The Communist Manifesto, ""Bourgeois marriage is, in reality, a system of wives in common…"" but because the expectations we heap on to it, both personally and politically, are ludicrous. When marriage was viewed as an economic and sexual transaction largely related to property, no one expected it to embody lifelong friendship and sexual passion. The idea of a joint loving, companionate partnership is relatively new. Yet it is what most people seek. Strangely enough, some of the weddings I have been to lately have been those of people who have been living together for many years, with their children, and do the deal precisely to avoid complications around property rights in the event of their deaths. It's lovely to see people go the distance, of course, but it's also miserable to see people stuck in unhappy marriages. When my own split apart, I was shocked at the number of people who wanted to tell me how awful their seemingly OK relationships were. They were only together because of the children, they had outgrown each other, they had affairs, they never had sex, or indeed hardly communicated. At the same time, the number of younger people still prepared to jump into marriage stuns me. On this point, I agree with Duncan Smith, the amount people spend on weddings is insane. And I speak as someone who enjoys a party, a drink and a cry. Nonetheless, younger colleagues spend their entire summers going to weddings, buying into the traditional package. The homogenous hen nights and gormless stag dos appear joyless but then if you believe this actually is your last night of ""freedom"", I suppose it is. Freedom is, of course, code for anything other than prescriptive monogamy. The reality is that many lead lives of serial monogamy, or simply turn a blind eye to each other's affairs. Until they don't. As well as the ""worried well"", there is now a burgeoning market for those I call the ""worried married"", who may not be so smug, after all. Things just aren't as they were. Kids get in the way. The relationship has to be ""worked on"", via the medium or tedium of mini-breaks and lingerie. You see these couples in every idyllic holiday setting the world over, sitting with nothing to say to each other. On a show about teenage sex the other night an 18-year-old was talking about how passion had dimmed after a year with her bloke. What hope is there for the rest of us? But sexual satisfaction is hardly part of the emotional and economic equation the Tories are making. Theirs is a marriage of fiscal and social conservatism veiled with concern for children. The only problem is these pesky women who refuse to stay trapped in marriages if they can afford to leave. It was not so long ago that the sanctity of marriage was preserved not by love but by fear. Fear of poverty. Fear of shame and blame. Yet it is not demands of women that have undermined marriage, but the more everyday demands of needing two incomes, which is a huge pressure for families. The great majority of our 1.9 million single parents didn't plan to end up this way, and would have preferred to keep their marriages intact. The question is not whether I believe in marriage, which is like asking whether I believe in mortgages. They exist. The question is whether you believe in yours. If so, fantastic. Lucky you. Why punish those who don't make that choice, or whose choices don't work out? If the issue is, literally, children, then support for single parents should be paramount. But that's not what is happening is it? Instead, we have a discourse of morality to counter material reality: poverty. The ""romance"" that has brought us to our knees is the one between the adulterous City and cuckolded politicians. A marriage of convenience, if ever there was one. A match made in hell, as it turns out. So let's get it straight: the dire state of the economy has nothing to do with whether people cohabit or not. Coupling and uncoupled. Leave us alone.","If marriage is so damn good, why does it need propping up with tax breaks? | Suzanne Moore",2011-02-12T09:01:00Z,Suzanne Moore,politics
"As belly dancers go, she was very pretty. I suggested that the dignity of the Italian state could find a crumb of comfort in that. The Italian to whom I said it was not amused. ""Please, let's not even discuss it,"" she said. ""It's too awful. I am too ashamed."" The Italian prime minister might face prosecution for buying sex from a minor, but a man is innocent until proved guilty. I therefore persisted in my attempt at consolation. What could be nobler in a Roman than to ""take pity"" on a poverty-stricken 17-year-old Moroccan beauty who turns up at his bunga-bunga party claiming to be the grand-daughter of his old friend, Mubarak of Egypt? What was more natural than a sudden urge to put his hand in his trouser pocket and extract €7,000, a diamond necklace and a free Audi? What is a prime minister for? The poor girl, who must have reassured the saintly Berlusconi by giving her name as ""Ruby the Heartstealer"", later called him from a police station. Was it not statesmanlike of him to order her immediate release into the caring guardianship of a local Brazilian prostitute? He was concerned at the possibility of an ""international diplomatic incident"". As the girl so wisely said – her predecessor having had trouble with the mafia – there was no sex between them. She had merely ""made a deep impression on sweet Silvio"", and he on her. In a breathtaking parody of Lord Gnome, Berlusconi even presented himself as a latter-day Gladstone: his enemies had failed to recognise his deeply philanthropic instincts. Had not one of his family newspapers reported that the girl was really 18, so it was OK? Italians should also know that, to a devout Catholic, ""bunga bunga, striptease and sex play"" does not mean sex. So-called ""observant Catholic"" readers of Christian Family magazine gave him a 50:50 benefit of the doubt. The whole business was a sad distraction, said the prime minister, from his ambition ""to spend time going round the world building hospitals for children"". Google ""Berlusconi"" and ""prostitute"" and you get a million-and-a-half links. The list would exhaust a Leporello. Google the same for David Cameron and you get a measly 65, all anodyne. (For the record, Sarkozy of France scores 5.7m.) There have always been problems in the conceptual tussle between a ""public interest"" in the privacy of celebrities and prurient curiosity. In the mid-1990s, any newspaper editor seeking to protect Princess Diana's privacy was on a hiding to nothing. Trivia went through the office like a hurricane. Once a story acquires a degree of prominence, it is beyond ""public interest"" and into raging nationwide obsession. Berlusconi's nocturnal antics have appeared, until now, to be within the terms of Italian law, which mysteriously regards the age of sexual consent as 14, but paying for sex with someone under 18 as illegal. Berlusconi has been protected, as in his business dealings, by various statutory immunities attaching to his office. These have begun to collapse following constitutional amendments. Now he is in deep trouble. Some 800 pages of evidence are said to present a prima facie case of illegal sex with minors. Even the most ardent champions of personal privacy cannot hold back the tidal wave of revelation deluging the print and electronic media. There is much-cited evidence that Berlusconi's political standing is still robust. This is attributed to a potent mix of Italian machismo, an absence of political opposition and the prime minister's ownership of the bulk of television and much of the press. His popularity rating, down from 40% to 35%, is still ahead of most European leaders with recessions on their hands. He has survived one parliamentary vote of censure and may yet survive another. This is all ostensibly Italy's business. What reasonably concerns Britons is the methods that have allowed Berlusconi to protect himself for 16 years from charges of corruption and personal disgrace. He is the head of a senior European government. He is a member of a council of ministers with majority voting and supranational institutions with increasing sovereignty over the British parliament and people. His party, aptly named People of Freedom, is under his thumb, through a patronage web that would do credit to Robert Walpole, and is a rebuke to list-based proportional representation. He controls most of the media and is widely reported as having cut a deal with the mafia to protect his family, for which the quid pro quo can only be guessed. Last week he sought to bolster his position by a series of giveaway reforms. These included dropping EU social chapter obligations on employers and offering extensive fiscal autonomy to the provinces of the Northern League, relieving it of the need to subsidise the south. The latter will be offered ""deregulation"", reportedly strengthening the existing grip of mafia families on its economy. If passed, the package could signal a partial disintegration of the Italian state. That is what happens when a leader is on the run and there are inadequate means of redress. Berlusconi's Italy shows how futile are the protestations of the European Union that it is a bulwark against anti-democratic forces and a beacon of rectitude to the outside world. Those who know and love Italy have long recognised it as a wholly different political culture from those of northern Europe. Business in the south remains in thrall to organised crime. A European commission that meticulously intervenes in Britain's hospital shifts, its cod quotas and its paternity leave turns a blind eye to Italy's institutional corruption and regulatory abuse. It ignores rigged markets in everything from Sicilian tomatoes to Roman tour operators and mafia property speculators, on whom Europe's taxpayers must have splurged hundreds of unaudited millions of euros over the years. The EU has done nothing to aid the work of brave Italians who have struggled for years to update their country's political economy, and much to undermine them. The reason Italy has endured Berlusconi for so long is because it lacks a constitution capable of curbing him. This should worry European bodies such as the EU, the Council of Europe, the OECD and others, who boast that they are guardians of a sophisticated democratic confederacy, and treat countries such as Turkey and Serbia as beyond the pale. The EU's appeasement of Italian governments has always been excused as in the wider interest of European unity. We tell Egypt how to run itself. We tell Israel how to run itself. We tell Palestine how to run itself. We tell half the world how to run itself. When did David Cameron or William Hague, or any British politician, last lecture Berlusconi on his blatant failings, given that he is part of the same political realm as the rest of us? Instead we lap up the gossip, giggle at Italian machismo, joke about the mafia, shrug that ""Italy is Italy"". We say it cannot be judged by the standards of the rest of Europe, while the means by which Berlusconi survives are Mediterranean exoticism. If I were not paying for it, I might agree. I am paying for it and I do not agree.",We giggle at his machismo – but Silvio Berlusconi has the last laugh | Simon Jenkins,2011-02-11T08:30:02Z,Simon Jenkins,world
"Cleggsy is no happier and when Dave asked for volunteers to mind him absolutely no one put their hand up until Francis Maude said he would gladly do it for time off in lieu, because last time he looked suicide watch was not in the job description. So Dave asked Picklesy but he could not miss Pilates. And the Fartmeister said his speciality is actually fallen women if anyone knew of any, and IDS was taking Betsy to Waitrose, and Julian said he and Lady Fellowes of Kitchener are working 24/7 on their balaclava helmet. Theresa has a painful verruca, Govey, Willetts and Letty had a trainspotting commitment and Blondie is finishing a speech called Goodbye Merrie England! plus he had to wash his hair. So Oik did evils at Caroline until she said she could spare a few minutes, which only meant Dave had to beg her to stick to trees since you can't trust her with anything, not even Cleggsy. So I totally saw why Dave came upstairs this amazing shade of pink, somewhere between fuchsia and hibiscus, going the lack of human kindness makes me literally see red and I said tell me about it babes, it is weeks since Danny did the rabbits and Vince has not even started on the garden. And he did not calm down until the Hiltonator came over to play him at Pirates vs Ninjas vs Zombies vs Pandas HD Lite, which is such an amazing way of putting something back, because actually Steve prefers Boggle, so cerebral. So how dim am I, I thought I would ask Anya for help, Dave is such a fan, but she went I am my own harshest critic and my biggest fault is doing too much for others plus the deal was high-profile business diplomacy Sam, leave it. Tamara went hysterical going OMG are you for real wait till I tell Anya she will DIE, and Mummy said oh dear I think that must be my taxi, and Daddy said he could spare half a pig if that helped.

"Boots is going to do an over-the-counter paternity test that should, if nothing else, put Jeremy Kyle out of business. It's no cheaper than the ones sold online, but that's not the point. Previously, DNA tests were for men crazed with jealousy, or looking for ammunition on the brink of a break-up. High-street availability marks a leap from ""doable but extreme"" to ""acceptable, bordering on respectable"". I personally ceased to associate Boots with respectability when they moved their tax affairs to Zug, but you know what I mean: it's a little bit like if they decided to sell poppers. The figure that Boots quotes for ""uncertain paternity"" is one in 25 children. I imagine this came from Sperm Wars, the popular science moment of 1996, in which Robin Baker cited a study that said 4% of human conceptions involve sperm from multiple men. The real notorieties of this book are its views on rape (actively sought by the woman as a way of testing the fighting spirit of the man) and on homosexuality (doesn't really exist). But at the point it came out, the uncertain paternity was the headline argument. I remember my dad saying that this was a rather conservative interpretation, since those were just the conceptions that occurred with multiple sperm in play at the same time, and didn't count those in which the sperm of the husband was interspersed with other sperm over a period of weeks. He thought the true figure was more like one in 10. It sounded to me like projection: he had a son, who he knew about but hadn't met, who thought his father was someone else altogether. My family is full of question marks like this. When people have children, and then they turn out to be other people's, there's always an attempt to stratify it: it's the underclass, or it's bohemians, or it's a DNA-test debacle on daytime telly. But it happens everywhere, and when people insist that it doesn't I increasingly think, chum, you just aren't concentrating. But however widespread the question marks are, I am extremely sceptical about whether anyone will take up the opportunity to test. First, Boots might not necessarily normalise the process of paternity testing. It could go the other way, and dent its own vanilla image through its association with this product. At the moment the test, Assuredna, connotes the same peeping sleaziness as that dust you can buy to check if anyone's been shagging in your bed (since you ask, it is called SemenSPY). Second, there is international precedent with over-the-counter DNA sampling. The US pharmacist Walgreen's launched a ""discover your DNA"" kit (the test wasn't for paternity, but for predisposition to disease) that was immediately withdrawn by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for reasons which have some crossover application here – considerations of consent, authenticity, storage and information-sharing. How can a child be considered to have given meaningful consent to a tissue sample? Does the sperm-donor anonymity argument work, that it's in the best interests of the child to know its real father? Donna Dickenson, emeritus professor of medical ethics at the University of London, says that the medical benefit is hard to discern here. What are companies even going to do with the samples? Assuredna say they incinerate them, but there are no legal guarantees or requirements for paternity testing generally. (In the US case some companies kept them, and were suspected of trying to compile a DNA database that they could flog to advertisers or drug salesmen. You have to tip your hat to entrepreneurship like that.) Those tests, incidentally, were already available online and still are: it was only their availability in a mainstream outlet that troubled the FDA. Third, it isn't lack of availability that's been standing, all this time, between a father and his copper-bottomed DNA-ratified certainty. What prevents most fathers seeking a paternity test is a fundamental trust that exists between people who aren't compelled to be together for any reason beyond inclination. That isn't enough to guarantee that everybody's related to who they think they're related to, but it seems to be enough to preclude most people even wondering. An interesting study came out last week in which the social psychologist Abraham Buunk examined ""mate-guarding"" in different societies – those in which parents arranged their child's marriage, compared to those in which the couple themselves made the choice. In cultures that kept the sexes separate, marriages tended to take place for social, political or financial reasons, centring on the wishes of the parents, not the couple. In cultures where a love-based choice was the norm, mate-guarding was rare. The author remarks: ""In western cultures, most husbands do not actively try to prevent contacts between their wife and other men and may even accept a moderate degree of flirting."" This is not a veiled attack on Islam: a large part of the study was based in Argentina, where different levels of parental involvement occur for a variety of non-religious reasons. The study points to one huge boon of love-based culture: the act of choice has given us trust. It doesn't need to be serviced with DNA check-ups, it simply exists. And while some of us might be wrong in that trust, most of us are right.",Paternity can be uncertain. But checking it is surely odd | Zoe Williams,2011-02-03T08:30:01Z,Zoe Williams,society
"Beyond frantic with LFW any minute and Andy leaving and Cleggsy so fragile, and Dave still needs a replacement Andy to explain to the public about forests, people can be so thick. I said why don't you just get someone like Daddy to tell them why landowning is so fun, he simply adores it and his enthusiasm would be so infectious? Probably a lot of people who don't get the forest thing have never closed a footpath or shot a rambler or held a kind of charming fete champetre as a chic summer party. Even Lady Julian of Fellowes says that woodland makes a very acceptable wedding gift, so what is not to like? I mean, unless you educate people it is like trying to sell a buttery-soft investment bag to someone who has only shopped at Primark, without showing them the hand-riveted quilting that makes it so worthwhile. So Dave said that was genius but he still needs a hack to bury the NHS sell-off, plus Oik has got this concept for selling traffic lights which could use some decent PR until people get what a brilliant hobby it would make for people who don't want to run a school or a library or a nature reserve, because almost everyone lives near a traffic light. Then Egypt happened and Dave had to send Govey to cheer up Cleggsy. So Govey read to Cleggsy from Tennyson's In Memoriam, apparently it was a Godsend for him during the awful elephant lamp business, but Cleggsy would not lighten up and come to Andy's party, ""too tired"", so pathetic. But that was fine because he definitely would have refused to jump out from under the table going Kerching! and we so did not miss his long face. And Andy cried and we sang Jerusalem and Dave said what a literal beacon of optimism, and all credit to the Fartmeister for his accompaniment but it almost drowned these weird sounds coming from Cleggsy's office. We ran down and Picklesy broke down the door and inside there was just the printer spewing out pages and pages and all they said was ""All work and no play makes Nick a dull boy.""

"They fear they've seen this movie before. In the first reel, the world watches with awe as the streets of a distant capital fill with the young and the angry, brave enough to shake their fist at a hated dictator. In the second, the statues fall, the tyrant flees and all hail a triumph for democracy. But in the final reel there's a twist: the original street rebels are pushed aside, replaced by a tyranny just as ruthless as the one it toppled – and much more menacing to its neighbours. That's the movie famously screened in Tehran in 1979 and which Israelis fear they are watching again in Cairo in 2011. One senior Israeli official told me: ""You can't watch the scenes of all these young people demanding their freedom and not get excited."" But at the same time, a question keeps nagging: ""Where's this heading?"" The answer Israelis dread is a replay of the Iranian revolution. They recall that the Tehran crowds which won western hearts 31 years ago also looked secular and modern – only to be rapidly displaced by a dictatorship of the ayatollahs. Israel's Egypt-watchers fret that the country's secular opposition parties are small, comprised of intellectuals with little grassroots support. Only the Muslim Brotherhood has the resources and organisation to take control. If the current regime topples, they expect the Islamists to take its place. To understand why that prospect chills the blood of Israel's policymakers, it's worth recalling a few nuggets of geography and recent history. Egypt looms over Israel from the south, dwarfing it in size and population: 80 million Egyptians outnumber Israelis by more than 11 to one. It is the most populous Arab nation and the de facto leader of the Arab world. If Egypt shakes, Israel trembles. Perhaps the key strategic event in Israel's 63-year history was the 1979 peace treaty with Egypt. At a stroke, what had been a battle between Israel and the entire Arab world – the ""Arab-Israeli conflict"" – was reduced to the more manageable dispute between Palestinians and Israelis. For 30 years, Israel has not had to worry about its southern flank. Just look at Israeli defence spending. When Egypt was still the enemy, defence accounted for nearly 30% of Israeli GDP, driving the country to the brink of bankruptcy. Now it stands at just 8%. So here's the scenario making Israeli heads throb. Hosni Mubarak leaves, replaced eventually by forces dominated by the Muslim Brotherhood. They hold elections – but they are of the ""one man, one vote, one time"" variety. Among the new regime's first moves is tearing up the Israel treaty – heeding the demands of those in Tahrir Square reportedly chanting for Mubarak to ""go back home to Tel Aviv"". No longer will Egyptian forces police the tunnels that run under the border with Gaza: instead Hamas will be allowed to import as much weaponry as it wants, including from Iran. Nor will Cairo play intermediary between Israel and Hamas (useful until Egypt-Hamas relations all but broke down recently). Suddenly the map will look very different, with Israel facing what one analyst calls Islamist ""encirclement: Hezbollah from the north (in Lebanon), Hamas from the west (in Gaza) and the Muslim Brotherhood from the south (in Sinai)."" If that scenario doesn't sound gloomy enough, Israel will have lost something even deeper. Beyond all the talk of borders and buffer zones, what Israel craves is recognition of its legitimacy – starting with acceptance of its existence. The 1979 treaty provided that, signalling an acknowledgement – grudging, maybe; cold, perhaps – that Israel was in the Middle East to stay. If Egypt were to annul that accord, the strategic bedrock of Israeli security and its sense of itself in the region will have been pulled away. This is what the Israeli official who spoke to me of a ""game-changer"" has in mind. Suddenly, Jordan would stand alone as the sole Arab state that formally recognises Israel – and judging by King Abdullah's hasty sacking of his prime minister today under popular pressure, that hardly seems a reliable foundation. Lacking the cover once provided by Egypt, the Palestinian Authority would be increasingly isolated in its policy of dialogue with Israel. Small wonder then that Israel's preachers of realpolitik are left concluding that democracy is fine in theory, but not, when it comes to the Arab world, in practice. As former foreign minister Moshe Arens puts it: ""Peace you make with dictators."" Only a tyrant, he argues, can deliver the two essentials of any peace deal with Israel: a promise to terminate the conflict and a guarantee of security, with no armed attacks from his territory. If Arens is right, then Israel is left hoping either for Mubarak to stay on or, at most, for his strongman-in-waiting, Omar Suleiman, to take over. But that is not just bleak in principle – putting Israel on the wrong side of a democratic wave it should welcome – it doesn't make pragmatic sense. For surely the events of recent days, in Tunisia, Jordan, Yemen as well as Egypt, have shown that no dictatorship is truly sustainable, not for ever. And if those regimes can't last, then nor can any peace made with them. Sure, the peace accord with Anwar Sadat and then Mubarak brought great benefits – but how much bigger a prize would be an Israeli peace with the Egyptian people, one underpinned by their genuine consent? That, and that alone, would be a treaty to last. The cynics will dismiss such talk as naive and Pollyanna-ish, the stuff of leftist daydreams. But it was the former Soviet dissident turned Israeli politician – and no leftist – Natan Sharansky, who long argued that peace depended on an Arab shift to democracy. Or listen to the former deputy chief of mission in Israel's Cairo embassy, Ruth Wasserman Lande. She agrees that Israel is right to be concerned by the upheaval in Egypt, that it should remain vigilant, ""with seven eyes in the back of its head"". But she also urges Israelis to listen to the protesters with ""open eyes and an open heart"". Doom is not inevitable. She notes the historic rejection by the Egyptian public of Islamist violence, a trend that dates back to the 1920s. Even now, jihadists who have mounted attacks on foreign tourists have won little popular support. She recalls the joint Israeli-Egyptian Qualified Industrial Zones established in 2005. They provoked protests – not by Egyptians angry at collusion with the enemy, but by jobless Egyptians furious at being excluded from the scheme. Show Egyptians that peace with Israel brings tangible benefits and they'll support it. Is Lande naive? ""I lived alone in Cairo for three years as a Jew and a woman and an Israeli diplomat. It's hard for me to be naive about Egypt."" For now, as Israelis watch their neighbour, fear is outstripping hope. But another reaction is possible. It would acknowledge that peace with Arab rulers alone could never last, that one day Israel will have to make peace with the peoples it lives among. That day may not be coming soon – but that truth just got a whole lot harder to avoid.","When Egypt shakes, it should be no surprise that Israel trembles | Jonathan Freedland",2011-02-01T20:30:00Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"It is most likely a female brain thing, but after a week struggling to understand the complex rules governing the conduct of football professionals this column is still none the wiser. Where was the especial gravity of the Sky Sport men's offence, within a culture whose very raison d'être is to keep fossils to the fore and all women out of sight? If anything, Sky's buffoons seem to have conformed, with exemplary dedication, to the demented standards upheld by the FA, with its single-sex board. To put it in the approved condiment terms: if the Sky men are the salt and pepper, the lineswoman is the ketchup and competitive team sport is everything else on the table, with Wayne Rooney as the stiff, dirty napkin, how is it the salt and pepper were punished for insulting the ketchup off camera when, with admirable concision, they merely expressed that characteristic mixture of contempt and abject sexual interest that the table reserves for all women athletes? Unusually in the modern world, it is an attitude many established sports successfully codify, with an all-male elect and the girls demoted to lesser, officially disregarded leagues in which they will be denied lavatories as well as a public following. Physical frailty is sometimes, but not always the excuse: all-male snooker and darts show that basic prejudice still works fine. But as we heard last week, with the intervention of Jeremy Clarkson, there is no room for complacency. Before long, perfectly normal levels of abomination will be classified as thought heresies and millions of completely harmless women-haters will find themselves living in a police state and then stoned to death for their banter. If there were any justice, the FA would even now be taking subscriptions for a bronze statue of the martyr, Richard Keys, renaming Wembley the Andy Gray Stadium and commissioning a Sky Sports Cup to be awarded, annually, to the best exponent of just having a laugh in this world of political correctness gone mad. As a number of female survivors have disclosed over the past few days, levels of brute sexism and discrimination persist in sport in a way that would not be tolerated anywhere else except the City, where the Keys/Gray comments have apparently been judged a little tame by experienced financiers skilled in the arts of constructive dismissal: did it never occur to the Sky men to invite the female lino to a lap-dancing club? Big mistake. The armed forces come over, in comparison, like a larger, more pugilistic version of the Grazia editorial team; even the BBC emerges well – women presenters are, at least allowed to earn and function like men until age regrettably makes this impossible. In fact, given the improved levels of enlightenment recently displayed by the corporation, it is all the more remarkable that it should promote, in every significant news programme, the monotonous, tribal swagger that is elite sport. Newspapers at least have the tact to package this stuff separately, except when national pride is at stake, for ease of disposal. Most mornings, the words ""Gary, sport"" on Today are the cue for millions of people to grind coffee, blow-dry hair, switch on an electric toothbrush, practise primal screaming: anything to drown out the latest on ball-kicking and horseflesh. Obviously, it is no use switching over to 5 Live where, in order to satisfy its 70% male audience, the BBC's guarantee is that no war will ever be serious enough not to be interrupted by a newsflash about a fallen wicket. Recalling Anne Atkins's preternatural ability to transmit her bigotry through a 3ft lead wall, it never seems possible to drown sport out altogether. Racing at Lingfield often commands attention, usefully for Surrey-based enthusiasts. What are our tips? Has flat racing had to be cancelled anywhere due to frost, or too much rain, or too little? Anything important for Today to discuss from the fascinating, exclusively male championships featuring football, rugby, cricket, Formula One or golf? It is impossible to imagine a flagship national news programme focusing comparable energy and talent on any other pointless activity of so little interest to around half of its audience, not forgetting the fairly large number of men who fail, like Orwell, to find kicking, spitting and fighting a useful form of bonding. What equivalent imposition could there be? ""Rob, control pants""? Even if bulletins about exclusively male sports were, after the interminable years of loyal BBC promotion, one-tenth as interesting to women licence fee payers as they are to their male counterparts, there should be some expectation by now that a state broadcaster would counter this with some coverage of women's team sport beyond its current zero. It is five years since the select committee on culture, media and sport reported on the frustrations of women footballers, finding ""actual hostility"" towards their game illustrated by, among other things, common abuse, inferior access to pitches (including those run by local authorities) and inadequate representation at the top: there were (and are) no women on the FA board, it has two out of 102 on its council. Although the FA, not untypically for a sports governing body, has been unwilling to progress, its conservatism could be exposed by any broadcaster which had not internalised the values of that famous ambassador for the game, Sepp Blatter. In 2004, the Fifa president came up with this surefire way of boosting the women's sport: ""More feminine clothes… they could, for example, have tighter shorts."" Maybe his theory could finally be tested in Qatar. Meanwhile, the ugly culture that nurtures Rooney and Andy, Sepp and the Wags remains an unchanging, ostensibly essential feature of national life, as if it might become endangered if left to dedicated fan-bases such as Sky Sport, 5 Live Extra, Talk Sport and ITV 4, an ""entertainment channel made for men"" featuring, it tells advertisers, ""those sports which embody male heroism: cycling, football and motorsport"". There's one possible explanation for the prevailing female indifference to these feats: the Women's Sports and Fitness Foundation finds that 36% of women ""enjoy the competitiveness of sport"", as opposed to 61% of men. Why, then, where advertisers are not involved, should the sport-averse be subjected to extended sessions of compulsory sport, as if they were still in class, forced out into the mud to contemplate the skills of the school elite? If poetry or theatre enthusiasts tried this on, there would be threats to the licence fee or of violence. Though a lack of female vim might well be explained by the lack of women's changing rooms at 94% of football pitches, it still confirms that the outcome of routine games, being so transcendently irrelevant to so many, hardly qualifies as national news. It is a tremendous point in Gray and Keys's favour that, where unreconstructed male idiocy is concerned, they had at least planned to keep it to themselves.",Forget getting rid of sexism in sport.

"Slouching in the shadows of one of the handsome boulevards that slope away from Edinburgh's George Street is a dark and splendid little howff called Fingers Piano Bar. Perhaps it opens during daylight hours and is forced to sell the wretched fare of the patisserie and the delicatessen that is alone deemed necessary these days to attract fickle and unfaithful tourists. I do hope not. Instead, I prefer to believe that not until the clock has struck 10 of a night will it open its doors and then only to those in search of a serious and uncompromising drink and low conversation. Often a house pianist is in residence, happily providing a Bowie and Roxy Music soundtrack for the louche and the damned, aka the Scotsman sports desk on a night out. Once, during a period of exile in my life, I had the privilege of toiling on Edinburgh's three great newspapers for a while and this subterranean gem provided sanctuary when the whine of bagpipes and the talk of soft furnishings was getting beyond a joke. There could a relentless Glaswegian such as myself wear a Versace suit and order inappropriate cocktails without feeling self-conscious about it. Yet nor was I impervious to Edinburgh's more formal charms during my sojourn in the east. On disembarking from the ScotRail cattle-wagons at Waverley station does not your spirit soar when faced with the serried splendour of the old town and the castle on one side, the Scott monument and Princes Street gardens on the other and the beautiful, old Scotsman building straight ahead? When first you encounter Edinburgh in all its raiment you think you have stumbled upon a tartan disneyland and that a giant Mickey Mouse in a kilt will soon accost you and offer you free bannocks and a Mellis cheeseboard. Yet to listen to the citizens of this place you would think they are living in a Stygian wasteland. Only rarely do they acknowledge the natural splendour of their city. It's almost as if they find it unbecoming to get enthusiastic about the natural riches that God has bestowed upon them. Perhaps this is why a new civic body has been established to market the city properly and to find a PR wizard to front it. ""Suitable candidates,"" says the job spec, ""will be visible, prolific networkers."" So, in a spirit of filial affection, and in the interests of transparency, I hope the city fathers will allow me to throw my chapeau into the ring by making my application for the job public. Last year, I applied for a job as postmaster of the remote Scottish island of Canna. As I have not heard back from the National Trust for Scotland about this matter, I must assume that they found someone else and doubtless less suitable. This, though, leaves me free to pursue this position. Here is what I have to say: Dear Lachlan/Farquhar/Mhairi, I feel I have impeccable credentials to be your new Edinburgh marketing chief. I worked in your city for seven years and during that time immersed myself in your couthy, but charming ways. Even now, I can still do a passable impersonation of Spud's accent during his job interview in Trainspotting, like. This is a rich and textured dialect and really ought to be promoted more. I would propose workshops in each of your 876 independent schools to educate pupils about its nuances. This would be both inclusive and achieve outcomes. I have also now gained proficiency in the fine Edinburgh tradition of locating and then disappearing into the nearest WC when it comes to standing my round at the bar. In order to promote your many wonderful taverns, I would suggest a citywide summer prize where each pub would nominate a patron. The winner would be the chap who can last the longest without paying for a drink. I am also a supporter of your tram scheme and wish to dissociate myself from the insidious campaign of treachery and vile innuendo which has enveloped this towering capital project. As such, I would guarantee to bang heads together, get all the chiels working again and to have it completed before your new deadline of 2050. And I would lobby the IMF for a loan at Irish interest rates. In that way, there will be no extra cost to the public purse until we're a' deid and the grandweans are adults. I am also able, of course, to recite those twin Edinburgh folksongs: Hearts, Hearts, glorious Hearts (it's down in Tynecastle they bide) and Oh, Oh, Oh to be... ooh to be a Hibee. I do not have extensive experience in the retail sector, but even I know that you need to sort out Princes Street, your main thoroughfare. Not only does it only have shops on one side, but none of them is worth two blows on a ragman's trumpet. I would convert your castle into a medieval-themed shopping mall, like Braehead or Silverburn, but without altering its essential character. I note also that the salary attached to this post is around £110K. I would be willing to accept a mere £50K for the honour of serving the people of Edinburgh, so long as you threw in some late-night taxi chits and a bijou, split-level number in the New Town with one of thon Perspex chimneys. Of course, as my main residence would continue to be in Glasgow, I would need to ask your citizens to pick up two-thirds of the mortgage repayments after the Holyrood fashion. In return, though, I would be an articulate and committed evangelist for Edinburgh-on-Clydeside by initiating a programme of cut-price Edinburgh festival ticket offers for punters attending the Francie and Josie retrospective at the Glasgow Pavilion. And free access to your book festival for all Glasgow schoolchildren under the age of 16.

"Arundhati Roy will turn 50 this year. I hope to be excused of sexism (would one write this of a man?) when I say that she looks no more than 35 at most. Her vitality has always been striking. I remember her from one of her early visits to London as a slight, supple woman with an Indian cotton bag slung over her shoulder, and gleaming skin and hair that suggested yoga and aerobics, yoghurt and juice made from fresh limes. My wife had baked scones in her honour. Roy looked at the scones as though they might be deep-fried Mars bars, but eventually and daintily conceded to try one. In her bag was the manuscript of a first novel that was to make her famous and (by the standards of writers) rich, and though some of that future could have been predicted (the manuscript had caused a stir among publishers), no one could have foreseen the Booker prize and editions in 40 languages. What has happened since the success of The God of Small Things is even more surprising. Among Indian public intellectuals, a bright category that includes the Nobel laureate Amartya Sen, Roy is probably now her country's most globally famous polemicist, as both a writer and speaker. Her essays are published across the world – the Guardian published a recent one in five parts – and she can pack out a big venue in New York and still have a few thousand listening outside. In India she draws even bigger crowds, and switches from English to Hindi. She tours extensively, and often to the kind of country towns and small cities that rarely see anyone so celebrated. Recently, she told me, 5,000 tribal people from 34 districts had gathered to hear her at Bhubaneswar in Orissa. Some had walked for days to get there; 40 had been arrested and charged with waging war against the state; two, she believed, had died in jail. ""So it isn't like Jaipur,"" she said, referring to India's first and largest literary festival, just ended, where well-fed writers are flown in from London and New York and put up in reupholstered palaces. This could easily have been her way of living, too – as, for a short time, it was. Instead she has spent the last dozen years castigating the Indian state for all its sins and omissions: grandiose dams that displace the poor peasantry, mineral quarries that threaten to do likewise, nuclear weapons, the occupation of Kashmir. Her prose takes few prisoners, and runs against the grain of urban India's swelling prosperity. A common criticism is her refusal to balance the bad against the good. Yes, the greed is spectacular. Yes, the corruption inside government may be obscene. Yes, 800 million people exist on less than 20 rupees (about 35p) a day. But look on the bright side. That leaves another 400 million doing better than ever before, in an economy growing at dizzying rates, with India now receiving the obeisance of the west. So why write so narrowly and speak so angrily? Roy has a standard reply. ""Suppose there are 10 people in this room. Seven are starving, and one is winning medals, and two are doing OK. And I say, 'Look at these seven people who are starving,' and you say, 'Oh don't be so negative, no, things are not so bad – look at the other three.' Really?"" She herself ranks quite high among the three-tenths. We met at her flat near Lodhi gardens, in one of the most desirable parts of south Delhi, where 4x4s with CD plates stand parked in dusty lanes, and diplomats come to shop. It would be wrong to see this as an example of a woman not practising what she preached. Although Roy is by no means a Gandhian renouncer of worldly goods, a good percentage of her royalties have funded causes she describes as ""edgy"", but is reluctant to name. ""It's not that I want to live in some slum and wear a handloom sari,"" she said. ""I'm not in sacrificial mode and I don't want to be saintly."" But she found her sudden wealth problematic. Fame she could handle, but ""the money just blew me out of the water. OK, so I wrote a good book, but that doesn't mean you need to be showered with money. If you're a political person, what do you do, what's the right way to deploy it?"" So, as a political person, how would she describe her politics? She has spent weeks with the Maoist insurgents in central India – a dangerous adventure in a bloody war that has killed thousands of people and emptied hundreds of villages – but she isn't a Maoist: ""I'm not unaware of what that kind of doctrine can lead to."" A Gandhian then? A snort of disbelief at the very idea: ""I ask those people who say they are Gandhians, if you live in a tribal village in the heart of a forest and 800 paramilitaries surround it and start to burn it and rape the women, what Gandhian action would you prescribe? Gandhian politics is a form of celebrity politics. It needs an audience. They don't have an audience."" A kind of liberal democrat perhaps? ""The nation state is such a cunning instrument in the hands of capitalism now. You have a democracy that strengthens the idea of the nation as a marketplace."" She said, ""I don't feel the need to define myself and give myself a flag."" The self-description she will settle for is ""writer"", but when I wondered if that word in this context meant sympathetic observer or explainer or advocate, she said it was more than that. Recently she'd had a letter from a Maoist prisoner in central India reminding her that in an early essay, The Greater Common Good, which argued against dam-building in the Narmada valley, she had written: ""I went to the valley because I thought the valley needed a writer."" The letter added, ""We need a writer too."" Roy, then, sees in her writing an Orwellian duty to bridge social distance, to bring home the truth about the poor and disaffected to the prosperous and content, and to realise their surroundings and situation as a good novelist would. In fact, the distances she needs to bridge are far greater than Orwell's – Wigan miners weren't to old Etonians as hill tribes are to metropolitan Indians – and her writing is more prolix and melodramatic. But for all that, she is intensely readable – fluent, never solemn and always confident. She denies extraordinary self-belief, but my guess is only because she's never lived without it. The scones episode was an early example (to the scone-maker: ""Well, I might just try one""), but her novel's publication process threw up many others. She had never published a book before, but she demanded, and was granted, complete design control – ""I wasn't going to have a jacket with tigers and ladies in saris"" – and refused suggested changes to the text from Sonny Mehta, the distinguished nabob of New York publishing (to be fair, she said, he later admitted that he'd been wrong). It was confident – and wise, too – to say she felt no obligation to write another novel. The work of producing the first one, she said this week, had been like four years in jail. ""I didn't want to be like some factory producing novels, and I don't want to live my life as a project – in some ways I want to do as little as possible. I didn't mean to write my other books [her essay anthologies] either. There's so much noise in the world, so why add to it? In my case, I only write when I can't not."" But what small demonstrations of her will these attitudes towards writing and publishing have turned out to be. Roy confronts her government on a wide range of issues. Last year there were calls for her to be charged with sedition after she was reported, not quite accurately, as calling for an independent Kashmir. By bitterly opposing Hindu nationalism in its violent as well as respectable forms – she would contest the difference – she has prompted a hatred that puts her in physical danger. Wherever this boldness has come from, it isn't the Indian ideal of the happy and extended family. Her mother ran away from a violent father in Kerala and married the first eligible man she met in Kolkata, a young assistant manager on a tea estate who was already victim to tea estate manager's occupational disease, which is alcoholism. They separated after three years, when Arundhati had still to reach two, and she and her mother and brother moved back to Kerala, where her mother ran (and still runs) a private co-ed school. In her daughter's word, a ""character"": she would lie in a zinc tub in her courtyard while one secretary clipped her toenails and the other took down her dictation for a letter of complaint to the local municipality. She now thinks of her mother as ""one of the most extraordinary people I know"". But the affection is retrospective. At the time she couldn't wait to get away – ""I'd had enough of this family business"" – and left home for Delhi aged 17. She had no contact with either her mother or brother for several years, until one day her brother read about her appearance in a film and managed to get in touch. A surprise that contained a greater surprise: he was in seedy hotel near the railway station and she was to guess who he had with him – a man Arundhati had no memory of ever seeing, their father. Her brother had found him in Kolkata, either on the streets or in the nearest thing to them, a home for the dying and destitute run by Mother Teresa. And so a reunion was arranged. She went, and met a ruin of a man who was ""totally vacuous and completely happy"". After the shock of his battered physical appearance wore off she imagined ""how much worse I would have felt if he was some golf-playing CEO. This was much better."" She laughed at the last sentence, ironising her instinct for fiction and the underdog. Later she said she'd learned ""to love and enjoy my father for what he was, I feel sorry that I couldn't do more for him"". Not many members of India's elite, which is what she is, have a parent who's plunged so dramatically into the social abyss. Ascribing political beliefs to personal histories is a notoriously suspect activity; remedies for cruelty and inequality can require no more than an alert morality. Roy attributes her own awakening to ""living as the child of a divorced parent and a mythical father among the smug Syrian Christians of south India – and also from leaving home at 17 and living on my wits"". But that encounter 25 years ago in a squalid hotel may also have informed her. Roy herself has been married twice, the second time to the film-maker and environmentalist Pradip Krishen. They now live separately. She's begun work on a second novel, 18 years after she started her first. ""I want to think about detail now and not about the full picture. After I finished The God of Small Things there was nothing I wanted to understand more than the way the big wheels are working. Now that I do, I want to deploy that knowledge in minute observation."" Some people in India feel that they've had far too much of Roy the campaigner and not enough of Roy the novelist, though she may have more political support than her critics suggest. Her view is that she has divided the urban middle class. ""Opinion is more polarised than you might think, and this worries the state quite a lot. The poor [including the Maoists] can remain in their forests and their villages. There are 200,000 paramilitaries already there [in central India] and the army's coming soon – the government knows how to deal with these things militarily."" Middle-class sympathy, on the other hand, isn't so easily treated. ""It's making the state unsure of itself and therefore more vicious."" An old friend of mine who knows her put it this way. ""She's a bit of a solipsist – she just can't imagine life without herself in it. There are many cleverer people, just as concerned with injustices, who have more rounded and considered views. But there's nobody else who's as critically engaged with the state as she is and so willing to take it on. So is she a good thing? Yes.",Arundhati Roy: India's bold and brilliant daughter,2011-01-29T00:06:00Z,Ian Jack,world

"I'll tell you one thing I've noticed about HM Revenue & Customs: they are incredibly nice on the phone. Calm, reassuring, profoundly sympathetic, it's much more like dealing with NHS Direct than it is with a business, except they don't tell you to go to casualty just to get you off the phone. However, like the NHS, HMRC might have retained the manners of the public sector, but the market dictates its methods. This is one of those canards that the left has real trouble rebutting: the private sector is more efficient; therefore, even in situations where a business is publicly owned or run on public money in the public interest, market values should be upheld – and where that's not possible, simulated. The way tax is collected is a classic example of this: very low earners are habitually ignored; middle and upper-middle earners have a lot of resources directed at them; very high earners are pampered and flattered like millionaires in a furrier's, except that this doesn't result in any extra sales. But we'll do that another day. So, over the past half decade HMRC has made a number of cost savings that make business sense but hit the low-paid (high earners either have very simple tax affairs – one job – or complicated tax affairs and an accountant). Some examples of these savings: there used to be a booklet called the P3, which explained tax codes and allowances, and might have alerted you to the fact that you'd been given the wrong code. Research showed nobody understood it, so rather than rewrite it intelligibly, HMRC discontinued it. The P2, a notice that tells you your tax code, is delivered only patchily. HMRC has an 0845 number, so it can be expensive to call; waiting times are very long; and only 55% of calls are answered (by contrast, the Department for Work and Pensions has negotiated itself a freephone number). Local tax offices have been shut down, new ones haven't been opened to match population movements, and now they are starting to restrict the times the phone lines are open. So, if you're on PAYE, there is almost no guidance except: ""Pay what we say, because we say so."" The picture with self-assessment – and it is generally middle and high earners who file their own returns – is rather different. Online returns are incredibly user-friendly, so long as you have a computer: 845 people (407 of them accountants on behalf of clients) filed returns on Christmas Day, proof that this is so well-designed you can do it pissed, in front of Starsky & Hutch. In 2001 30,000 people filed returns online; in 2010 it was nearly six and a half million – a real achievement, of which the press office is audibly proud. It makes perfect business sense to concentrate on self-assessors. The complicated PAYE tax affairs of a person with two or more low-paid, frequently changing jobs are just not worth that much money. Making things easier for people without easy access to a computer is not very zingy. It's not the kind of idea you'd feel pleased with going into a business meeting. The upshot of this was clear when, after a massive data-matching spree, HMRC discovered that more than 4 million people deserved repayments on 08/09 and 09/10. And it is estimated that 1.4 million will receive unexpected demands. John Andrews, of the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group, explains: ""By definition, those people must be on low incomes, because they can't afford the somebody to stand in the middle between them and HMRC. Your accountant would not allow you to have unsettled years, it would be part of his job to ensure that the figures were properly analysed."" On a low income, overpaying and underpaying tax are equally bad: if the first, you struggle to live on less than you are due; if the second, you struggle to pay the money back. On higher incomes it's not such a big deal; if you overpay, as long as you get it back, you have an accidental savings account. If you underpay, there is more room in your budget to allow for repayment. HMRC accedes that the main area of error is people with two or more income streams, especially if these are insecure and change often – and nobody would dispute that these are likely to be low incomes. It doesn't necessarily mean two jobs; someone could have a small pension and invalidity benefit. Andrews fleshes out this picture: ""Forty per cent of people on IB are on it because they've got mental health problems. I'm dealing with lots of people who've got these mental health problems, who get demands that they don't understand and can't afford, and it's driving them back on to increased medication. We're talking about peanuts income."" Which is exactly the point: this, I suspect, is how mistakes were made in the first place, because resources and strategy are, as in any good business, geared towards bigger payers. The values of the market are no good here. This is the tax system; everybody paying into it has to be equal in its eyes. People do not deserve help in proportion to how much business they bring in; they deserve help in proportion to how much help they need. It takes the sting out if you're racing to beat the self-assessment deadline, though, doesn't it? At least if there's a mistake, then you probably made it yourself. And at least you weren't filing on Christmas Day.",Penalised as you earn: PAYE for those who make peanuts | Zoe Williams,2011-01-26T21:05:33Z,Zoe Williams,uk
"Critics of the publication of the Palestine papers by the Guardian and al-Jazeera are aiming their fire in several directions. They have variously claimed that the documents are fake; that they are partial; that they reveal nothing new; that they should never have been published; and that they help Hamas, damage the peace process and threaten to destroy the two-state solution. Let's start with the silliest first: the claim of forgery, casting these papers as the Hitler Diaries of the Middle East. That was swiftly swept aside today by Nabil Shaath, a former member of the Palestinian negotiation team who, along with several others close to the talks, vouched for the documents' authenticity. Are they partial? Only in the sense that 1,600 pages out of tens of thousands could always be described as incomplete. Some have complained that the documents only provide the view from the Palestinian side of the negotiating table. But they purport to do nothing else. To suggest that makes them unsuitable for publication is to suggest the New York Times should never have published the Pentagon Papers without an equivalent stash of paperwork from the North Vietnamese defence ministry. But clearly, say the critics, these were leaked by someone with an agenda. I don't know the identity of the source for the Palestine papers, but I'd be pretty surprised if they didn't have a purpose for their actions. That is true of every leak through recorded time. Should the Daily Telegraph not have published Liam Fox's letter protesting over defence cuts last autumn because the leaker of that letter clearly had a political objective? Of course not. Observe that standard and we'd never know anything. Besides, readers can usually put two and two together. Still, say some complainers, these papers don't reveal anything we didn't know. Indeed, they are ""incredibly boring"", according to Noah Pollak of Commentary magazine – so boring that they warrant six separate pieces on the magazine's website. Joining the ""nothing new"" chorus is Benny Morris, eager to pour cold water on the revelation that the Palestinians were ready to concede areas of East Jerusalem settled by Jews. Didn't the Guardian remember that those very areas were conceded back in 2000 as part of the ""Clinton parameters"" that followed the Camp David negotiations? But it's Morris who's suffering memory loss here. Surely he recalls the claim, repeated endlessly, that Yasser Arafat and the Palestinians had rejected those 2000 terms. He should remember: after all, Morris was one of the lead disseminators of that message. If Palestinians now accept what they once rejected, that's news. What of the graver charge that the Guardian had no business publishing papers whose exposure could discredit the Palestinian leadership and thereby damage, even destroy, the peace process? This is not a question confined to the wilder shores of the rightwing blogosphere. In a round of media interviews, I was asked by one mainstream journalist: ""How does the Guardian feel about putting a gun to the head of the two-state solution?"" This touches on the argument rehearsed so fiercely during the WikiLeaks furore. It is that once an organisation has been handed information like this, it either publishes it or it suppresses it. Those are the options. Which is why no news organisation worthy of the name would hesitate to release a trove of documents of this kind. Only in the rarest exceptions – where there is a direct risk to a named individual's life – should journalists withhold such information from their readers or viewers. (Indeed, to protect certain individuals some documents have been redacted by both the Guardian and al-Jazeera.) Of course publication will have political consequences, even awkward ones. But that cannot be for journalists and editors to decide: their job is to find out what is happening and report it, as best they can. The consequences are for others to manage. It has to be that way, otherwise newspapers would never publish anything: somebody in power would always be there to argue that it was best to hold off, that now was not the time. And the public would remain in the dark. This is particularly true for the Middle East, where there is all too little daylight. Take Tunisia. It may be an exaggeration to call the people's revolt there the ""first WikiLeaks revolution"", but it's clear that revelations about the luxury lifestyle of the ruling family played a crucial role. Yet when those diplomatic cables were first released, Barack Obama slammed the document dump as ""deplorable"", while Hillary Clinton branded it an attack on America and the international community. The point here is that journalists shouldn't be expected to weigh all the possible consequences of publication because the most important can – as in the Tunisia case – be unforeseen. Already there are signs of that with the Palestine papers. The initial assumption of many observers – and perhaps of the leakers themselves – was that the revelation of Palestinian negotiators' willingness to compromise would not just offend Palestinian pride but instantly spark a wave of revulsion, leading to a Tunisia-style revolt against the PA. With the PA gone, the peace process would be over and the two-state solution gone for ever. That could still happen, especially given the PA's already low standing among its population. But, initially at least, the Palestinian public does not seem to be following the script. One Palestinian insider told me yesterday that some Palestinians suspect a plot against the PA, hatched by al-Jazeera's Qatari paymasters in favour of their Hamas allies. The man in the Ramallah street may have little faith in the PA, but he doesn't relish the Hamas alternative or like outside interference. What's more, says that senior Palestinian figure, the leak of these papers could do something the PA had failed to do: prepare Palestinian public opinion for the painful concessions that peace will, one distant day, require. This leak has blown apart any pretence that an agreement could come without a heavy price. Now there can be an argument about what precisely a future deal would look like and what it would be worth – an argument in the open. A similar process happened in Israel after Camp David in 2000, when a leak revealed the prime minister was countenancing the division of Jerusalem. There was sound and fury, but a taboo was broken. This time round the Palestine papers are already having a useful impact in Israel – prompting a clutch of influential figures to realise there is, after all, a partner on the Palestinian side. So yes, you might not like every word. For the record, I disagreed with the Guardian editorial that described Palestinian concessions as ""craven"": I prefer to admire the readiness of the Palestinians to move, urging Israelis to do the same. Still, I cannot join those who wish these texts had stayed in the dark.  • This article has been launched with comments off.

"Who will be most damaged by this extraordinary glimpse into the reality of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process? Perhaps the first casualty will be Palestinian national pride, their collective sense of dignity in adversity badly wounded by the papers revealed today. Many on the Palestinian streets will recoil to read not just the concessions offered by their representatives – starting with the yielding of those parts of East Jerusalem settled by Israeli Jews – but the language in which those concessions were made. To hear their chief negotiator, Saeb Erekat, tell the Israelis that the Palestinians are ready to concede ""the biggest Yerushalayim in Jewish history"" – even using the Hebrew word for the city – will strike many as an act of humiliation. Referring to Ariel Sharon as a ""friend"" will offend those Palestinians who still revile the former prime minister as the ""Butcher of Beirut"" for his role in the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon. Telling Tzipi Livni, Israel's then foreign minister, on the eve of national elections ""I would vote for you"" will strike many Palestinians as grovelling of a shameful kind. It is this tone which will stick in the throat just as much as the substantive concessions on land or, as the Guardian will reveal in coming days, the intimate level of secret co-operation with Israeli security forces or readiness of Palestinian negotiators to give way on the highly charged question of the right of return for Palestinian refugees. Of course it should be said that this cache of papers is not exhaustive and may have been leaked selectively; other documents might provide a rather different impression. Nevertheless, these texts will do enormous damage to the standing of the Palestinian Authority and to the Fatah party that leads it. Erekat himself may never recover his credibility. But something even more profound is at stake: these documents could discredit among Palestinians the very notion of negotiation with Israel and the two-state solution that underpins it. And yet there might also be an unexpected boost here for the Palestinian cause. Surely international opinion will see concrete proof of how far the Palestinians have been willing to go, ready to move up to and beyond their ""red lines"", conceding ground that would once have been unthinkable – none more so than on Jerusalem. In the blame game that has long attended Middle East diplomacy, this could see a shift in the Palestinians' favour. The effect of these papers on Israel will be the reverse. They will cause little trouble inside the country. There are no exposés of hypocrisy or double talk; on the contrary, the Israelis' statements inside the negotiating room echo what they have consistently said outside it. Livni in particular – now leader of the Israeli opposition – will be heartened that no words are recorded here to suggest she was ever a soft touch. Still, in the eyes of world opinion that very consistency will look much less admirable. These papers show that the Israelis were intransigent in public – and intransigent in private. What's more, the documents blow apart what has been a staple of Israeli public diplomacy: the claim that there is no Palestinian partner. That theme, a refrain of Israeli spokesmen on and off for years, is undone by transcripts which show that there is not only a Palestinian partner but one more accommodating than will surely ever appear again. Where does this leave the peace process itself? The pessimistic view is that what little life remained in it has now been punched out. On the Palestinian side these revelations are bound to strengthen Hamas, who have long rejected Fatah's strategy of negotiation, arguing that armed resistance is the only way to secure Palestinian statehood. Hamas will now be able to claim that diplomacy not only fails to bring results, it brings national humiliation. But the despair will not be confined to the Palestinians. Others may well conclude that if a two-state solution is not possible even under these circumstances – when the Palestinians go as far as they can but still fail, in Livni's words, to ""meet our demands"" – then it can never be achieved. This is the view that sees Israelis and Palestinians as two acrobats who, even when they bend over backwards, just cannot touch: the Palestinian maximum always falls short of the Israeli minimum. The optimistic view will hope these papers act as a wake-up call, jolting the US – exposed here as far from the even-handed, honest broker it claims to be – into pressing reset on its Middle East effort, beginning with a determination to exert proper pressure on Israel, pushing it to budge. It goes without saying that in any wager between optimists and pessimists in the Middle East, the smart money is usually on the latter.",Palestine papers: Now we know.

"Given the economic, constitutional and social impact of what the coalition is planning, effective opposition is overdue. Yet David Cameron and Nick Clegg have had a more or less free ride, intellectually and politically. Received wisdom is that public spending is the most serious threat – not the operation of British capitalism. It has not been an entirely free ride – witness the protests over tuition fees – but there urgently needs to be a sustained and coherent challenge. Labour should not shed the reasonableness of the Blair years, but Ed Miliband, until now feeling his way, must use the opportunity of Ed Balls's promotion to the shadow chancellorship to open up the economic arguments. All change is predicated on a more rational national conversation. In that spirit here are 10 ideas. 1 BREAK UP THE BANKS British banks have long abdicated their responsibilities to British entrepreneurs, small firms and Britain's less advantaged cities and regions. Credit is too expensive and available on too tough terms. Thankfully that is now obvious to all. Labour urgently needs to define its position before the banking commission reports in September. A second financial reform would be the creation of a city by city network of virtual stock exchanges on which very small companies could raise capital on privileged terms. 2 BUILD GREAT COMPANIES Too few British firms have good owners. Two more important companies – Smith and Nephew, and De La Rue – are fighting to retain their independence from foreign takeovers. Their shareholders do not care about innovation, their staff or customers; their priority, and thus that of the directors, is only next month's share price. Increasingly Britain is a hollowed out economy for hire rather than a centre of business decision-making and wealth generation in its own right. There has to be root-and-branch overhaul of the framework for owning, directing and launching takeovers of Britain's companies. 3 BUST THE MONOPOLIES Takeovers create monopolies and diminish competition. The new oligarchs in finance and the media have concentrated not just economic but political power. Mega banks, mega media corporations like News Corp, mega retailers or mega mining finance houses limit the dynamism of our economy. Yet Britain's competition regime remains weak and confused. The competition commission needs greater powers, more autonomy and more resources: it needs to become a genuine force that is feared. American capitalism took off when the US busted Standard Oil in 1911. Britain needs its own trust-busting moment and tradition. 4 ABOLISH REDUNDANCY PAYMENTS We live in an economy based on knowledge, and this is where growth in employment will come from. But it is a fast-moving and risky world. The average firm is shrinking and its life expectancy shortening. Companies of whatever size are wary about taking on workers if they have to pay large sums in redundancy in the event of their business becoming outmoded by new technologies. They are also wary of undertaking vital research when the payoff is so insecure. Britain should follow Denmark and phase out all but minimal redundancy payments – I know this sounds frightening but I'll explain in a moment. A quota of all procurement, public and private, should be allocated to small firms. There would be a surge of private sector innovation, investment and employment. 5 LIVELIHOOD INSURANCE Reducing redundancy payments will create more risk in the labour market. Ed Balls should propose a national livelihood insurance scheme to replace the redundancy regime. Workers and their employers would pay insurance premiums into a livelihood insurance fund (companies might divert funds from the redundancy pot) that would guarantee up to 90% of previous earnings for up to three years after redundancy. This would provide a cushion on which workers could fall and then begin retraining. 6 A CITIZEN GRANT OF £50,000 FOR EVERY 21-YEAR-OLD This grant would be available to every 21-year-old as a citizen entitlement. It could be spent solely on education – repaying tuition fees – or on training or on starting a new business. The aim is to create citizen entrepreneurs navigating their own careers and lives with solid assets behind them from early adulthood. They would have a stake in our society, be incentivised to think long term and responsibly about what they wanted from their lives. It would be funded by new taxes on property (see below). The coalition's abolition of the child trust fund – Labour's faltering step in this direction – was a monumental mistake. 7 PAYBACK TIME FOR BABYBOOMERS   Britain must confront a taboo – our refusal to tax property. And we must be brave enough rapidly to increase the pension age to 72. It is unfair that nearly a million 18- to 24-year-olds are unemployed and face impossible house prices while millions of babyboomers sit on £1.3 trillion of untaxed wealth in housing. Labour should commit to lowering the top rate of income tax to 40%, but pay for the reduction – along with the citizenship grant – by introducing capital gains tax on all housing sales. This, together with increasing the pension age to 72 by 2030 and removing some exemptions from VAT, would comfortably raise the funds for the spending commitments above – and allow some partial reversing of the coalition's spending cuts. 8 AN END TO PARENTS-PAY EDUCATION Social mobility is collapsing in Britain. We need opportunity for all – impossible while the private school system remains so entrenched, their students offered a direct route to the upper echelons of British society. Private schools should lose their charitable status and be compelled to admit, through competitive examination, children from households with less than £40,000 a year. Their fees would be paid by the government. 9 AN HONEST MEDIA   British democracy is coarsened by a media that is becoming ever more partisan and uninterested in impartial dissemination of information. Britain should introduce a fairness doctrine regulated by a media standards commission. 10 A WRITTEN CONSTITUTION ALONG WITH PROPORTIONAL VOTING The coalition government's unilateral reduction of the number of MPs in the Commons and the sidelining of the boundary commission process has made the case for a written constitution unanswerable. We can no longer have a constitution that is remade by whatever party in power to suit its particular interests of the moment. Proportional voting – a single transferable vote – is a necessity. In particular, there should be an entrenching of local government's power: it should have the constitutional right to raise up to half its revenue from local taxation.

"How terrible that Marie Caro has committed suicide out of ""guilt"". She was the mother of Isabelle Caro, the French anorexic model, who posed naked, bones jutting, skin stretched, eyes sunken pools of horror, for the 2007 ""No Anorexia"" campaign. At her worst, Isabelle weighed 3st 13lbs and ate two squares of chocolate and four or five cornflakes a day. She died last November, aged 28, after being admitted to a French hospital suffering from dehydration. Marie is said to have taken her own life, consumed with guilt. Isabelle's stepfather says this was because it was his wife who insisted that her daughter go into the hospital. (In a case still pending, the Caro family believes the hospital failed Isabelle.) Aside from this, you wonder if, for Marie, guilt had become a way of life, the default guilt that's the lot of almost every mother, capped by the guilt of Isabelle's illness and death. In her book, The Little Girl Who Didn't Want to Get Fat, Isabelle said her mother didn't want her to grow up. ""I wanted to have the body of a child for ever, to make my mother happy."" This belief is seemingly contradicted by her mother's subsequent battles with her over food, but who are we to know? What we do know is that other mothers of anorexics have come forward to talk of their own crippling ""guilt"". This seems odd when anorexia has long been classified as a disease. If a mother would not blame herself for her child's cancer, then why would she take the blame for her anorexia? Because society dictates that she should? If so, what rot. Anorexia is a disease, an issue of mental health, with myriad and complex triggers which, in a long list, can include family dysfunction. What it is not is: ""Something Mummy does to you!"" Despite this, there often seems this undercurrent in cases of food disorders in girls. If we are not blaming magazines and skinny models, it's Mum's diets, body consciousness, vanity, their selfish, screwed-up example. Too much bad influence, too little vigilance – for the mother of an anorexic, there is always a way to blame herself. One presumes a lot of this information about mothers was gleaned from medical interviews with sufferers, the majority of whom are young girls. The problem is that young girls are likely to plant the blame on their mums, not just about anorexia, but about anything. There's a possibility that you could ask some girls about global warming or Iraq and they would find a way to pin it on their mothers. They're not being horrible, they're not even being anorexic, they're just being young girls. It doesn't make what they say true, but it does make for an impossible burden of guilt for mothers of anorexia sufferers everywhere. In truth, blaming mothers, even partly, doesn't make sense. If anorexia is a disease, then would a different mum, a non-dieting, non-oppressive mum, have made much difference? Moreover, if maternal influence were really this powerful, then why do these girls not get better when mums, along with the rest of the family, do their best to get them to eat? Indeed, the real amount of influence these mothers have over the onset of this condition seems all too evident in how pitifully little they have over its cure. It seems to me that where the dark dance of anorexia is concerned, the sufferer pirouettes alone, a twisted, broken ballerina. Meanwhile, the mother stands aside, forced to play wallflower, with the rest of the world. Was this Marie Caro's story – crushing guilt, accepted and absorbed, but for no real reason? It seems that it's high time we took the maternal guilt out of anorexia in order to see it more clearly. If we accept that anorexia is a killer, what we have here looks like a double homicide. Politicians dyeing? It's a grey area  What's with all the ""hair McCarthyism"" towards male leaders at the moment? David Cameron and Barack Obama have both been ""outed"" and denounced for dyeing their hair. Shots of them greying have been gleefully juxtaposed against more recent ones of them, looking furtive, with ""darker hair"". When they say ""darker"", they mean ""trying to look younger"". Did you get that? Personally, I prefer both men with the more ""pebble-dashed"" look, or, should I say, distinguished. When ""darker"", Cameron, in particular, takes on a ghoulish ""Westminster meets Twilight"" air. All of a sudden I can imagine him sporting a black net kerchief at a 1980s goth disco, and dancing to Soft Cell nonchalantly. Not a great look for a prime minister. As for Obama – things being the way they are, it makes a lot more sense for him to be ageing in front of our eyes. After all, the same thing happened to Tony Blair, whose boyish looks disappeared in office, to be replaced by someone so raddled he looked as if three ghosts were visiting him in the night. Every night. Ed Miliband has yet to acquire the hot politico look of ""prematurely greying desperation"", but give him time. One thing is for sure, there must be a more edifying way forward than the thought of Obama and Cameron sitting in hair salons, towels around necks, having Vaseline dabbed around their ears to avoid ""staining"", reading old copies of Take a Break. With this in mind, tipping a bottle of Nice'n'Easy ""natural medium brown"" on to politicians' heads to make them look younger, fresher, more electable, could be viewed as counterproductive. If grey hair is the price of leadership then the dignified thing is not to fight it. For a silent birth, we're hearing an awful lot about it John Travolta's wife, Kelly Preston, is said to have undergone ""silent birth"", in keeping with her religion, Scientology. Personally, the idea of ""silent birth"" seems creepy, woman-hating, and just plain wrong. Whether intentional or not, it's as if Scientology itself is intoning: ""You are a woman. Only you are biologically equipped to give birth, I suppose we are going to put up with that. Just so long as you don't make too much of a fuss. While you are passing this new human being through your birth canal, we don't want to hear a peep out of you, for um, spiritual reasons – is that clear?"" Why is Preston buying into this tragic quasi-macho rot? Why is Travolta, for that matter? Moreover, Scientology, like many other religions, has its sanctimonious, pompous and freaky sides – but if these rituals are really so sacred and divine, then why do they feel such an urgent need to broadcast every detail? Do they get the Scientology equivalent of Blue Peter badges for this kind of thing? It seems a bit ironic that the only thing ""non silent"" about Ms Preston's birth was all the bragging she's done since.",It's too simplistic to blame mothers for anorexia | Barbara Ellen,2011-01-23T00:07:43Z,Barbara Ellen,society
"'It's so unfair,"" is the cri de coeur of every teenager. Everything sucks. No one cares. I hate myself and I want to die. Bedroom door slams. Aren't they amusing, these giant babies, who think the world revolves around them? With their peculiar music, total self-absorption and fantasies about what the world ought to be like. One of these days they are going to find out … Find out that they are, perhaps, right? How can anyone read a headline that says ""£10bn for Goldman [Sachs] staff as youth unemployment nears 1m"" and think it's not unfair? One in five of the 16-24 age group is out of work and in some areas – certainly where I live – it is much higher. There are no jobs. The most beautifully manicured CV will not get you a minimum-wage job in a pub. Your brilliant degree is meaningless when what employers repeatedly emphasize is ""experience"". So if some of these kids are kicking up a fuss with their shouty demos, or Dancing Against the Deficit Lies (which could be as effective as Dancing About Architecture) then who can blame them? Every rite of passage of becoming an adult – a job, an income you can live on, affordable housing, independence from parents – is being taken away. For all the ""Solidarity"" Twitter hashtags, we are not Tunisia, not yet even Ireland. But I tell you what I know: youth unemployment is a global, not national, trend. Every bit of politicking ought to take that into account. The one thing young people have is time on their hands. Their turn will come. This generation is being described as ""lost"". But it is also finding itself. The scrapping of the EMA, which enabled nearly a third of people in poorer parts the country to go on to higher education, is a direct capping of possibility of better lives. Ninety per cent of those on free school meals went on to claim EMA. Spoken of dismissively as pocket money by those for whom £30 would not buy lunch, it paid for travel, food and yes, god forbid, sometimes going out! It was, after all, given to the generation who have been made to jump through every possible hoop going. Target-setting pursued with hyperactive glee by Labour (where was the Ritalin when it was needed?) became what education expert Michael Fielding wonderfully called ""the Viagra of economic and educational underperformance"". At one stage our poor children were sitting more than 100 tests during their time at school, with no noticeable improvement in standards where it most mattered. At least, they thought, they could have some fun at university. Now they realise debt is no fun and that this continual assessment did not necessarily make them employable. At both ends of the scale there are problems. We have more Neets than any other European country, kids who have fallen though the cracks in the system. Everything that might get them back on track is, at the moment, subject to cuts. We pretty much know the lifestyle of the unemployable young man, and we know the one thing that he is able to produce – babies – may not be ideal. Even for those who have performed well, life can be difficult. At a debate I took part in the other night, organised by Editorial Intelligence, James Caan of Dragons' Den fame talked of how ill-prepared many graduates were for interviews. They do not do basic research about the companies they are applying for jobs in. Chantal Tregear, director of communications consultancy Taylor Bennett, spoke of the work she did in getting people to write decent CVs, and how she went through them crossing out sentence after sentence that started with ""I"", and trying to get them to indicate that they could work as part of a team. All agreed unpaid internships – which are on the rise – are wrong, and yet at a time of such unemployment they remain a foot in the door. I – well there's my chance of an interview with a blue-chip company gone – feel ambivalent. To be told that an interview is always a sales presentation often results in that awful Apprentice-style jargon of nonsensical egomania. Guidance is clearly needed, but the reduction of all education to a utilitarian approach centred purely on employability is probably the last thing the economy needs. Critical and connected thinking is still to be prized. Yet employers are saying that those sent to them are lacking basic social skills. They don't know how to shake hands, looks someone in the eye or even be in any way personable. I guess no one takes exams in that. Careers advice, such as it is, seems as useless as it was when I was at school. When I said I wanted to travel, I was told to be an air hostess or join the army. A nightmare for the aviation industry was averted. I went on the dole. But crucially, I got off it. What I am talking about here is the long-term exclusion of a generation, and the repercussions that follow. While we are being told never to retire, what are they meant to do? Change our incontinence pads as well as service our debts? No wonder our young people excel at intoxication. All the parental anxiety over the right sort of education has still not fixed the job market. You may pay a fortune for Anastasia to do Mandarin at three, or cough up for a child to board so you can rest assured they will ooze the charm and clubabbility that remains highly valuable. It is a sure sign of my lack of schooling that I often muddle the traits of an elite education with some kind of autistic spectrum disorder. But even privileged children will live in a world where many of their contempories are far from fine. It looks as if today's 18-year-olds may drift from job to job with long gaps in between, with no hope of homes of their own. Sure, I can gripe in the standard middle-class way about my older children never being able to leave home. That is but one issue. The hyping of expectations about what and how our children can achieve has been ridiculous. Reality shows such as The Apprentice or Big Brother have promulgated the notion that if only you sell yourself enough you will get bought. Such cocky individualism and over-selling without any sense of responsibility is what brought down the banking system. The team playing and listening skills valued sometimes in the public sector may be less glamorous and may not make good telly, but thankfully I have seen plenty of it exhibited among young people who want change. Parents always say they want a better life for their children. We are now told that can't happen. They can't have what we had. So are we to write them off as the collateral damage of the crash? Or sneer, as some do, at their lack of a coherent philosophy? Like we had one, you mean? Like the one that led to the housing bubble and incredible, unpayable debt? Those in power may well be prepared to lose a generation: to lock them out or lock them in. But let's not call this ""social exclusion"". Let's call it what it is: criminal neglect.","After school I went on the dole, but crucially I got off it. Sadly our kids won't | Suzanne Moore",2011-01-22T08:59:00Z,Suzanne Moore,society
"It's fast becoming the Mousetrap of the publishing world, a creaky old drama on which nobody can quite bring down the curtain. The New Labour cast is wearily familiar, the plot a matter of record: yet somehow, Power and the People retains the capacity to shock. This second of four unexpurgated volumes of Alastair Campbell's diaries (a tactfully redacted version was published while Gordon Brown was still in power) covers Tony Blair's first two honeymoon years in power. The author clearly intends it as a monument to achievement, rebutting claims that golden opportunities were wasted in the first parliament; but what leaps off the page is a cautionary tale. Huge events unfurl, yet one is irresistibly drawn (thanks to Campbell's eye for the absurd) to the smallness beneath: the petty rivalries and vanities of politicians within his own party and others. Half farce, half tragedy, the story hinges on one fatal flaw: the ego ""the size of an elephant's arse"" – said of Clare Short, but true of many others – possessed by many senior players. As Blair remarks after one world leaders' lunch: ""if people had seen it, they would be terrified these people were running the world."" Some Labour supporters may lack the stomach for this, but it should be required reading for coalition MPs because, despite a sometimes exhausting level of detail, there is still no better minute-by-minute account of what life is like in No 10. With its contempt for the media rivalled only by scorn for colleagues, it is the chronicle of a sour, distrustful political age. The uncensored diaries were expected to damage Brown, and there are embarrassing anecdotes enough: tales of paranoia and secrecy, and reckless disregard for the damage done in pursuit of personal ambitions. At an EU finance summit, Brown warns Campbell that it would be ""very bad"" if Blair were seen to succeed in talks where he failed. The diarist is left suspecting ""he would rather we lost than have to face headlines saying Blair had saved the day"". Yet such stories (and worse) have been rehashed so often that they no longer surprise; they are balanced by scrupulously recorded flashes of analytical brilliance or shrewdness, which help to explain why Brown's behaviour was tolerated for so long. The politician who does emerge diminished is Peter Mandelson, portrayed as a vain attention-seeker prone to taking credit for others' actions and exaggerating his importance. There is a toe-curling anecdote about him trying desperately to get invited to Princess Diana's funeral, claiming to be a ""personal friend"": within months of election Blair fears he is ""becoming a liability"". While the prime minister obviously valued Mandelson, from these diaries it's hardly clear why. The reader may wonder whether the two men's rivalry – or Campbell's irritation with what he calls Mandelson's own ""insufferably self-indulgent"" memoirs – colours his view. There are few earth-shattering revelations in the new passages, although the accounts of Diana's funeral contain uncomfortable hints of palace pressure on the young Prince William to walk behind her coffin, amid fears the public might otherwise attack Prince Charles. Jack Straw's son Will may also be interested to read that when he was caught, aged 17, buying cannabis in a tabloid sting, it was Campbell who suggested his father ""take his son to the cops, get him cautioned"". (He was actually arrested.) For the first time, Campbell also effectively outs himself as the source of the Observer's infamous story suggesting that Brown had ""psychological flaws"". He also describes more explicitly the tensions in the Blairs' marriage caused by what Cherie sees as her husband's over-reliance on his aide, Anji Hunter. The uncensored Blair, meanwhile, comes across as irreverent – prone to impersonating world leaders behind their backs – and impatient. He despairs privately of some ministers, concluding that ""even the ones we thought were good were not that good"". By his third day in office he worries they are losing the initiative. The question of whether Blair did lose momentum too fast is central to this book, not least because the current government's hyperactivity – scheduling big welfare, health and education reforms alongside deep spending cuts – reflects a firm belief that New Labour moved too slowly and timidly. Yet this account of a driven Blair racking up benefit cuts, Bank of England reform, a Northern Ireland peace process, early devolution and a bold but doomed stab at Lab-Lib coalition suggests there was barely space for much more. The clear lesson is that pressures of office drive out thinking time, and that unexpected events or human foibles – what Campbell calls the ""Peyton Place-ness"" of personal Downing Street dramas – are the enemies of progress. No doubt the current No 10 team, criticised for delegating too much, will also ponder Blair's conclusion that ""most of our problems have come from when I have let others make decisions"", and his resolve not to make that mistake again. That alarming whiff of self-belief illustrates how many seeds of this government's end are discernible in its beginning. Blair's early skirmish with Iraq (the bombing raids of December 1998) reveals his hawkishness towards Saddam Hussein and his firm view that ""whether we think they are in the right place or not"" the UK should not withdraw from American-led military action. Brown's unsuitability for leadership is writ large in his inability to work with others; Campbell's aggressively personalised approach to hostile media, ultimately his undoing, is also clear from the start. The irony is that after years of berating journalists for focusing on personality not policy, the full diaries end up neatly demonstrating how crucial personalities can be. As his exasperated master concludes, the government at this stage ""had no real political differences but we had massive egotism"". David Cameron, so far, has the opposite: a coalition divided on issues but lacking (Ken Clarke and Vince Cable perhaps excepted) many rogue elephants. The moral of these diaries is to keep it that way.","The Alastair Campbell Diaries, Volume Two: Power and the People 1997-99 by Alastair Campbell | Review",2011-01-22T00:05:40Z,Gaby Hinsliff,review
"Early in the Arnold Bennett novel that's titled after his surname, the young Edwin Clayhanger comes home from school to find his father in conversation with an unknown old man who looks like ""an ancient simpleton"". Clayhanger senior is a prosperous member of Five Towns society who owns a printing works. When he introduces the feeble old stranger to Edwin as Mr Shushions, the schoolboy notices ""a round yellow tear"" forming in the red rim of the old man's eye. The tear reduces Edwin to a state of ""blank humility"" but, unlike the reader, he never discovers the reason for it. The cause, as Bennett confides to us in a subsequent chapter, is his father's secret history. Not quite 40 years before, in his role as a charitable Sunday-school teacher, Mr Shushions had rescued the older Clayhanger from his fate as an eight-year-old labourer struggling to survive the cruelty and squalor of the industrial revolution. The workhouse beckoned. And now look at the Clayhanger father and son! Successful, well-dressed, well-nourished, well-educated! Mr Shushions cried because he loved them ""as only the benefactor can love the benefited"". Clayhanger was published in 1910. At that time, and for long afterwards – until about yesterday, in fact – a British writer could look back at the past and thank God for the present. There were, of course, Golden Agers such as William Morris and GK Chesterton lamenting lost crafts and rural traditions, and a strictly linear progression, forever upwards, couldn't always be observed: the death toll on the Somme makes 1910 an easier year to be fond of than 1916. But writing, when it imagined the past, tended to look down from a superior position, and in this it did no more than reflect the ordinary human feeling that while it would be lovely to visit one's ancestors, one wouldn't want too long a stay. Would their house have a bathroom? Would they smell? How many meals of old bread and hard cheese could one face in a week? Now a different mood can be detected. The past – the past of 40 years ago and less, no further from us than child labour was from Mr Shushions – is both envied and chastised. Envied because it looks as though Britain will never again be so carefree and prosperous as it was between the 1960s and the middle 2000s; chastised because the habits and beliefs that flourished in those years have blighted the futures of our children. Last week, talking about her new novel We Had It So Good in the Guardian, Linda Grant thought ""the jury was out"" on her generation, and that it was time ""we took a long, hard look at ourselves"". At the turn of the year, again in the Guardian, Geoffrey Wheatcroft went even further. Endorsing the historian Tony Judt's verdict that ""my generation has been catastrophic"", Wheatcroft concluded: ""If there's any hope at all, it must be that our crappy generation can slink away in shame, and let a younger generation see if they can manage things better."" The two writers were making different, if overlapping, points. Grant was attacking what she's described elsewhere as the ""toxic legacy"" of the youth cult that began in the 1960s; her principal character can't imagine ever growing old, and when he does grow old, laments that he's just as materialist as his parents (""We were supposed to be so special, we were going to change everything and it turns out we're just the same … ""). Wheatcroft takes a more specific aim at the hubris and incompetence of western politicians since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Both, however, fix the blame on ""a generation"" rather than a narrower grouping such as social class or political inclination. ""Appeasers"" take the rap for the second world war just as ""stupid old generals"" do for the slaughter of the first, but it's rarer (Nazi Germany might be a counter example) to find an entire age group in the dock. I know both writers. Being a few years older than Grant – like Wheatcroft, I was born in 1945 – I guess I might be let off on a technicality if charged with the sins of the ""baby boomer generation"", which in any case, is a term borrowed from America and quite wrongly applied to the postwar pattern of British birth rates. (Not until 1975 were as few babies born as in 1945; more British babies were born between 1956 and 1966 than in the so-called boomer decade of 1945 to 1955.) Nonetheless, I recognise the same privileges and luck that came to many of those born during what insurance actuaries and sociologists have determined as the luckiest birth year of all, the annus mirabilis of 1948. We grew up protected by a new welfare system. Grammar schools and further education grants promised and often delivered upward mobility. We were too young for national service and too old to be hurt by negative equity. The pill, house-price inflation, unprecedented wealth, relatively mild economic recessions, the end of social deference, no world wars: all these delivered pleasures and freedoms unknown to our parents, and we were wrapped inside a security blanket that won't be available to our children. So we have been luckier than the generations on either side. Whether we are morally inferior is a different question. Obeying Grant's injunction to take ""a long, hard look at ourselves"", I can't see that people born later – pick any year from the 1960s to the 1990s – are behaving any better than we did. They may be more aware that the earth's resources aren't infinitely exploitable, that burning carbon has consequences and that cheap labour provides many of our comforts, but none of these seems to have decreased an unthinking devotion to pleasure, consumption and debt that startles those of us who carry memories of ration cards and mum's Co-op dividend number. It's almost as though they know that a way of life is ending, as indeed it is. The west is ceding power to the east with an inevitability and speed that Grant's archetypal 1960s anarchists could never have foreseen, or Wheatcroft's condemned politicians done much about. I'm writing this from Delhi, where recent history is seen differently. For baby boomers, read the generation defined by Salman Rushdie as Midnight's Children, the first to be born in independent India. They have their critics, too: some would say the influential among them accepted socialist ideas too readily, and imprisoned India for too long as a low-growth economy only theoretically committed to greater social equality. All that has gone. There are some unattractive results, aesthetically and morally, in the shape of shopping malls, increasing corruption and dizzying disparities in wealth. But the middle class goes on swelling, and many lucky individuals have made the elder Clayhanger's journey out of penury. Its cities have the vibrancy and optimism of Victorian Britain, as well as that age's darker side. Here is a place you could still find Mr Shushion's famous tear.","We baby boomers blame ourselves for this mess, but is it that simple? | Ian Jack",2011-01-21T20:20:28Z,Ian Jack,society
"The ugly American is back. Can the handsome one do anything about it? When Barack Obama addressed a shocked nation in Tuscon, Arizona, yesterday, he deployed the only weapon left to a crippled presidency: the power of rhetorical cliche. He deployed it brilliantly. ""Together we thrive,"" he cried meaninglessly. ""For all our imperfections, we are full of decency and goodness."" While American hearts were broken, ""yet our hearts also have reason for fullness … The forces that unite us are stronger than the forces that divide us."" Despite pleas to keep war jargon out of political discourse, Obama asked: ""How can we honour the fallen?"" The answer came in copious references to heroism, family, home, hearth, to ""September 11 … faces of hope … simple wishes … those in need … the American anthem … hand over heart"". True Americans, said Obama, ""jump in rain puddles"". In a tribute to a nine-year-old gunned down by a madman, he added: ""If there are rain puddles in Heaven, Christina is jumping in them today."" More substantive was the president's remark that it ""is part of our nature to demand explanations, to try to impose some order on the chaos"". The process also involved ""debating what might be done to prevent such tragedies in the future"". Americans had to make sure that they speak to each other ""in a way that heals, not a way that wounds"". Foreigners are always surprised by the US's capacity to speak right but somehow not do it. Washington must contain more wisdom and talent than anywhere on earth, yet it contrives the disaster zone that is American foreign policy. This is normally put down to such impediments as the US constitution, the silent majority, sheer bigness and freedom of speech. Today's culprit is freedom of speech, or at least the speech of the American right and its broadcast cheerleaders. Shock-jock radio presenters feed on biased television news to present a view of the world divided between goodies and baddies. The baddies are always on the brink of victory and must be confronted with virile aggression. Language that might not disturb a balanced mind can clearly stimulate and legitimise an unbalanced one. The vitriol and inaccuracy of the campaign against Obama's public health reforms last year were like those against abortion and homosexuality. To many Europeans, the echo across the Atlantic came from a people isolated from the outside world and unable to handle today's social and scientific progress. The debate was infused with nastiness and xenophobia, as if the US was a land composed of tribes bred only to hate the outside world, and often themselves. I was asked some time ago by a university-educated Texan, in the nicest possible way, what it was like to live in a country of ""baby-killers"" about to be ""overrun by Muslim bad guys"". I inquired where he had gained this bizarre impression of Europe, which he had never visited. It turned out his sole information about the world beyond America's shore came from Fox News. He was not stupid. But he and millions of people like him considered this source of news a sufficient window on the world. He genuinely thought American troops would soon have to save Europe from ""the Arabs"". Freedom of speech, like freedom of traffic, can only be defined by the curbs and regulations that make it real. The right wing seeks to curb WikiLeaks, and the left seeks to curb ""hate speech"". The right wants the freedom to finance unlimited political propaganda, and the left wants the freedom of unlimited access to state secrets. There is nothing peculiarly American about this. Last month Julian Assange of WikiLeaks was in effect gagged when he was jailed after embarrassing the government. The racing car boss Max Mosley went to court to seek a court order censoring journalists. There were efforts to censor the Twitter site of the crackpot celebrity Kenneth Tong for promoting anorexia. No sooner does free speech open its mouth than someone puts a foot in it. Free speech is a Hobbesian jungle. It requires a marketplace where the trade in information, ideas and opinion has a framework of rules, including rules that maintain fair and open competition. Most will be voluntary, but others need enforcement. The US supreme court last year freed from control all political campaign gifts from corporations, on the grounds that this would be a breach of free speech. Ronald Dworkin's rebuttal of this ""devastating decision for democracy"" in the New York Review of Books pointed out that freedom of speech was hopeless if vulnerable to the bullying of wealth. Obama warned that it would ""open the floodgates for special interests – including foreign corporations – to spend without limit in our elections"". Yet Obama himself declined to champion the ""fairness doctrine"" that once governed broadcasting licences awarded by America's Federal Communications Commission, and governs them throughout Europe. The doctrine was rescinded in 1987 under pressure from the right, stimulating the growth of one-sided broadcasting outlets such as shock-jock radio stations and Fox News. While Jon Stewart and others have counter-punched from the left, it strains credulity to maintain that this polarisation has had no impact on the virulence – and immobility – of American public life. Under Britain's 2003 Communications Act, Ofcom's rules on ""due impartiality, due accuracy and undue prominence"" are voluminous. So is the BBC code of practice on balance. Both require impartiality within news presentation rather than just between channels – or not at all, as in the US. Article 10 of the European convention on human rights goes further. It subjects freedom of expression to ""such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society"". This is defined as ""the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence"". This is not freedom but authoritarianism, and mercifully seems to be a dead letter. When it comes to Mosley's defamation or Tong's twittering, most Europeans would rely on self-discipline on the part of the media, and on the chaotic pluralism of the internet. Even so, they would argue for regulated airwaves, as they would for laws preventing libel, slander and incitement to illegality and racial hatred. Freedom can only flourish in a climate of discipline. When the art historian and TV presenter Sir Kenneth Clark was asked what quality best defined civilisation, he did not answer with liberty or wealth or equality. He answered with courtesy, the framework of rules governing people's tolerance of each other, so their discourse might be creative. Most of the time, it is best for that courtesy to be informal. The best rebuttal of the politics of hate is a torrent of love – or, if not love, at least of facts. But sometimes, as Obama said, there is a yearning ""to try to impose some order on the chaos"". If American politics is now going the way of wounding, not healing, it needs the tonic of order. It is the great paradox of democracy.

"     Throughout his presidency a doubt about Barack Obama has lingered, one that first surfaced during his campaign for the White House that began nearly four years ago. The fear was that – for all his oratorical brilliance – Obama somehow lacked empathy, that he was a slightly chilly, aloof figure, that he struggled to connect emotionally. We'll hear much less of that talk now. For the address he gave at last night's memorial service for the victims of the Arizona shootings was elegiac, heartfelt and deeply moving. It both rose to the moment and transcended it: after days of noise and rancour, he carved out a moment of calm. Much of the speech was dedicated to its core function: to commemorate the dead and comfort those in mourning. He spoke in detail about those who had been slain, describing them one by one – the elderly couple who had lived life as if it were a ""50-year honeymoon"", the husband who shielded his wife from the bullets, dying so that she might live. Most affecting, he spoke of Christina Taylor Green, the nine-year-old girl born on 11 September 2001 – the president, doubtless thinking of his own daughters, seeming to brim with emotion, at one point emitting a noise somewhere between a sigh and a suppressed sob. In all this, he spoke less like a politician than a pastor or priest comforting a grieving community. The focus on those who had saved lives was an attempt to offer hope amid the sadness: ""Heroism is here,"" he said, an echo of his own famous declaration that ""We are the ones we have been waiting for."" He reminded his flock of what really mattered: it was ""not wealth, or status, or power, or fame – but rather, how well we have loved"". This is part of the US presidential job description that sets the office apart: more than mere head of government, an American president is required to be almost a spiritual leader to his nation. Obama ascended to that role in Tucson yesterday, with no less aplomb than Bill Clinton summoned in Oklahoma City in 1995. For all that, such a moment will – inevitably – have political reverberations. This was no ordinary memorial service – that much was clear from the cheers and ovations that greeted frequent chunks of the stadium speech (and that might have grated on some ears). What, besides proving Obama's ability to empathise, will be the political impact? Crude though it is to say so, it will have boosted the president's standing enormously. After the partisan bickering that followed Saturday's killings, Obama stepped forward to be what analyst Nate Silver called ""the adult in the room"". This was meant to be the Republicans' week, as they took control of the House of Representatives and its legislative agenda. Instead they look small – as well as defensive, fending off accusations that it was the violent rhetoric of the right that fuelled the current toxic political environment. None smaller than the de facto leader of today's Republican party, Sarah Palin, who preceded the Tucson address with an aggressive, self-regarding and petty-minded videotaped message that claimed she had been the victim of a ""blood libel"". The contrast between the two performances could not have been sharper. Obama looks the bigger person, calling for a discourse that heals not wounds. That puts him in the place all presidents covet: above the fray, beyond mere Democrat or Republican. Ronald Reagan got there, but few others manage it. The challenge will be to maintain that position into the re-election year of 2012. But such thoughts are for later. What will be remembered today are moments like those when he told his audience that Gabrielle Giffords had opened her eyes for the first time – moments when only the most cold-hearted would not have felt a tear. What we saw from Obama in Tucson will be a defining, even cherished moment in his presidency.",Barack Obama's Tucson speech rose to the moment and transcended it | Jonathan Freedland,2011-01-13T12:33:36Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"Until Saturday, it was a fair working assumption that Sarah Palin was just a few weeks away from announcing her candidacy for the presidency of the United States. Barack Obama launched his campaign in February 2007, a full 21 months before polling day in November 2008, making February 2011 the obvious time for anyone with an eye on 2012. But if Palin had pencilled an imminent date in her diary, she's certainly rubbed it out now. Events outside a Safeway in Tucson have seen to that. It's not exactly fair. Palin didn't pull the trigger that killed six people, including a nine-year-old girl, in Arizona and left a member of Congress fighting for her life. But politics isn't fair. The cold reality is that the individual most politically damaged by the Saturday shootings is the former vice-presidential candidate turned reality TV star, bestselling author and all-round media phenomenon. For proof, just imagine how a Palin presidential campaign would now unfold. Her fellow Republicans might steer clear of the Arizona killings in the primary phase of the contest but, if she somehow became her party's nominee, she would be challenged constantly about a single image: the map she posted on her website last autumn dotted with 20 gunsight-style crosshairs over 20 congressional districts occupied by Democrats who had dared to vote for Obama's healthcare reform – among them one Gabrielle Giffords. Palin might try to argue that she wasn't really targeting Giffords and the others, echoing the absurd attempt by one of her closest aides at the weekend to pretend those rifle sights were really ""surveyor's symbols"". But that won't wash, not when Palin herself referred via Twitter to the ""'bullseye' icon used 2 target the 20 Obamacare-lovin' incumbent seats"". More importantly, there would be a potent witness ready to testify against Palin: Giffords herself. The most important 13 seconds of videotape could prove to be the clip, already running on a loop on American television, of Giffords complaining last autumn about that crosshairs ad, warning those behind such violent imagery to ""realise there's consequences to that action"". That statement, full of poignant prescience, can't help but point a finger at Palin. If, as those around her hope and pray, Giffords survives, she would need to do no more than appear on a platform or in a TV ad in the 2012 campaign to indict Palin. She would embody in her very person the case that the former governor of Alaska lacks the judgment to be president. Perhaps Palin could have overcome this obstacle, expressing deep contrition for the crosshairs map and vowing to join those calling for calmer, cooler public discourse. But her response since the shootings has deepened her problem. Her single public statement was chilly and defensive. It began, ""My sincere condolences are offered …"" a form of words that, one senior Democrat mused to me, looked as if ""it had been drafted by a lawyer"", anxious not to say anything that read like an admission of guilt. The result is that the Giffords shooting – and Palin's statements before and after it – have seared into the public mind a version of the would-be president that alienates her from the moderate and independent voters crucial to any general election victory, aligning her with the most extreme elements of the Republican party. One former Democratic strategist noted the visual grammar of that target list of Palin's: ""Remember the instigators of those abortion clinic murders? They had a list and went down the list. This puts her in that camp."" Is any of this fair? If it is true that, as one veteran political adviser puts it, ""The crosshairs are now on Sarah Palin's career,"" is that just? There is much Palin could point to in her defence. The evidence is scant – so far – that the alleged gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, was a paid-up member of the Palin cult (if you doubt that it's a cult, read a sample of her followers' comments on Facebook). At first glance, he seems less the determined political assassin than a man in a dangerously advanced state of mental illness. If Loughner didn't see Palin's call to arms in the last midterm campaign, and developed his hostility to Giffords long before anyone had heard of the Alaskan huntress, then surely, her allies will say, she should escape any blame. What's more, Palin is hardly the first politician to use the language of combat. She could argue that anyone who has ever referred to ""battleground"" constituencies, talked of candidates ""wounded"" by ""fatal blows"" or arguments ""shot down"" is just as guilty as she is. In this, she could cite the unlikeliest examples. It was the sainted Obama who revved up a crowd in 2008 by declaring of his Republican opponents: ""If they bring a knife to the fight, we bring a gun."" I know it's not her style but, if Palin wanted to offer an international example, she might even mention Britain's Liberal Democrats. Despite its long reputation as the cuddly party, the Lib Dems had a ""decapitation strategy"" in 2005, aimed at lopping off key Tory heads such as Michael Howard and Oliver Letwin. So why make Palin the villain? Yet these attempts at exoneration go only so far. Even if Loughner is shown to suffer from extreme mental illness, he did not exist in a vacuum. Instead he lived in a climate that pervades today's United States, and that exists with particular intensity in Arizona, in which political violence is glorified. Last year, Giffords' Republican opponent held an event encouraging voters to join him and ""shoot a fully automatic M16"" to ""help remove Gabrielle Giffords from office"". Congresswoman Michele Bachmann said she wanted voters to be ""armed and dangerous"" against Obama's energy policy. On Fox News, Glenn Beck speaks daily as if on an underground resistance network, urging his audience to rise up against the wicked dictatorship that has somehow usurped power. This is in a different category from Lib Dem talk of decapitation. First, it is taking place in a society in which many millions carry real, rather than metaphorical, guns. Second, it is not generalised rhetoric but directed at specific, named individuals: that Republican candidate urged voters to shoot an automatic weapon to get rid of Giffords. In this context, it is not hysterical to suggest some of this will have rubbed off on a disturbed young man such as Loughner. As Andrew Sullivan has pointed out, the gunman could have chosen anywhere for his rampage, but he chose a specific politician whom many influential people – including Palin – had already defined as a target. By rights, then, those who have been stoking this fire should be shamed into changing their vocabulary. Yet the precedents are not encouraging. After the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, Bill Clinton denounced the ""loud and angry voices"" who, he said, were guilty of ""spreading hate and leaving the impression … that violence is acceptable."" Clinton's response to Oklahoma revived his presidency, but it did not still the loud and angry voices: Rush Limbaugh was spewing vitriol then and he's still doing it now. Obama goes to Tucson today: if he can do as well as Clinton, he will have done himself a great favour. If he can do better than Clinton, and make a lasting impact on the tenor of America's public conversation, he will have done his country a great service.",Sarah Palin's presidential hopes surely can't survive this assassin's bullet | Jonathan Freedland,2011-01-11T21:00:00Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"The first thing to be emphasised by their secretary, Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, following the announcement of William and Kate's engagement, was that, in the midst of their personal happiness, the couple were ""mindful of the economic situation"". Just how mindful, on the continuum that goes from vaguely conscious to coping valiantly with the vicarious stress and anxiety, can now be judged from their newly announced decision on wedding catering: a buffet. Moreover, out of sensitivity to the economic situation, post VAT-rise, this buffet will be the humblest of spreads, supplying canapes only to fewer than half their guests. With the possible exception of a hog roast, the couple could not have picked a more frugal option, one recommended by Debrett's when ""the budget is tight"". That the budget is anything but, Charles having recently increased his personal fortune by 4%, only confirms the prodigious royal mindfulness. Kate's willingness to arrive at Westminster Abbey in a car rather than a carriage has also been recognised as an acknowledgement that we are all in this together. Indeed, with her regular motor, vestigial nibbles and hand-me-down ring, Kate's populist instincts recall nothing so much as the late Queen Mother's, after Buckingham Palace was hit during the blitz. ""It makes me feel I can look the East End in the face,"" she said, knowing that a tolerant East End would not object if she subsequently returned to a largely intact palace, full of staff. ""I was so pleased with the behaviour of our servants,"" she wrote to her mother-in-law. ""They were magnificent."" As The King's Speech, that terrific, Republican-crushing endorsement of the royal family is reminding modern audiences, a true spiritual connection with the British people can transcend any amount of inequality. Having said that, it is hard to see how the chancellor, George Osborne, can now convince his critics that he genuinely, as advertised in a memorable conference speech, feels our pain. ""Modern Conservatives understand that we are all in this together,"" he said in 2009. ""It is not the quantity of money saved so much as the example set."" Personally, he had already given up boating with the Rothschilds. But following his more recent return from Klosters, a resort principally associated with Prince Charles and fellow fan, Tara Palmer-Tomkinson, the public will definitely require more from Osborne, by way of reassurance, than a buffet and a principled stand on carriages. The cost of this heartless outing, so different from the royal display of austerity awareness, was estimated by his critics, who hailed from both left and right, at £11,000. What kind of message did that send out? For the Taxpayers' Alliance, John O'Connell said: ""With hikes in VAT and fuel duty, it won't be a very happy new year for many taxpayers, so some will see this as highly insensitive, given their own circumstances."" Others fingered for insensitivity over the new year period include the multimillionaire MP, Zac Goldsmith, whose holiday rental, a Caribbean villa, cost £8,000 a week, and the speaker, John Bercow, who held a New Year party, described as ""star-studded"", for which guests, including Duffy and Ross Kemp, had paid for tickets. Soon after, proving its impartiality where insensitivity is concerned, a leading mid-market tabloid discovered Alan Johnson in the Savoy (""recently refurbished at a cost of £220m""), brazenly having lunch with a PR: ""The hypocrisy was extraordinary."" In reality, that is impossible: Ed Miliband is still, with the help of his advisers, reconsidering Labour's position on acceptable lunchtime venues and will decide whether or not we are all in this together some time before the next election. Osborne's position is harder to fathom, particularly after David Cameron had the good sense to cancel a three-week holiday in Phuket, so as to look less rich. Instead, he kept his head down in Chequers, where, in another saving, his personal film-maker has been replaced by the Hollywood director Tim Burton, working free of charge. Bizarrely, Osborne went out of his way to oblige his critics, supplying newspapers with all the material they required for a picture of heedless, Neroesque extravagance featuring Klosters, his signature scowl and, yet more sinister, a snood. Perhaps it was a point of principle. Unlike Cameron, whose kitchen broadcasts eclipsed his wife's trophy handbags, and in contrast to Mrs Thatcher, who concealed her wealth and ambition behind a show of penny-pinched domesticity, the chancellor may despise low, populist symbolism. Anyway, everyone knows he is rich. Only last week, full-page newspaper advertisements, placed by the 38 Degrees group, showed him in an Artful Dodger's top hat, accused of avoiding 1.6m in tax, via a £4m trust fund: ""Is George Osborne the Dodgiest Dodger of them all?"" To judge by comments on his holiday, however, a lot of taxpayers perceive such inequality as less offensive than the prospect of public servants enjoying themselves, even at no public expense. Cameron's tight smile on his new year walk appears to be as much fun as anyone is allowed to have until the demands of austerity, as laid down by the elders of the Taxpayers' Alliance, have been satisfied. The Bercows might have got away with their charity fundraiser had it not featured those twin insults to puritanism, fireworks and dancing. Alan Johnson could have escaped scot-free from, say, Nando's, so long as he drank something that does not lend itself to quaffing or slurping. As for Osborne, he could easily have skied in the Czech Republic: in Pec pod Snezkou, for instance, chalets start at £250 a week. Even in Austria, a family resort with an unpronounceable name would probably have provided red-top immunity. The chancellor's refusal to make this simple, meaningless sacrifice is something for which, one day, he should surely be honoured by bankers, CEOs, David Cameron and other, prosperous beneficiaries of the martyrdom in Klosters. Like Clegg, with his monopoly on student rage, and Fred the Shred, the banking bogeyman in 2009, and Sir Philip Green, focusing all the rage of UKuncut on a single, sun-kissed belly, Osborne and his holiday soaked up most of the available indignation in the week that bankers' salaries and bonuses were reported to have soared, along with executive pay. Nor will his critics rest until he holidays like the rest of us, in Dorneywood. In the same speech that gave us ""we're all in this together"", Osborne offered a less celebrated hostage to fortune: a ""tough message"" for bankers. ""If we find the money that should be going into stronger bank balance sheets diverted into bigger pay and bonuses,"" he warned them, all imperious, ""we reserve the right to take further action."" What manner of thing would it be, this fearsome ""further action"", of which he spoke? Now it is revealed: he would go on holiday to Klosters, in his little snood. • This article was amended on 17 January 2011. After bombs fell on Buckingham Palace in 1940, Queen Elizabeth, the late Queen Mother, wrote of her pride in her servants to her mother-in-law, Queen Mary and not, as we said, to her own mother – Cecilia Bowes-Lyon, the Countess of Strathmore, had died in 1938. This has been corrected.","Loved the postcard from Klosters, George, it said it all | Catherine Bennett",2011-01-09T00:06:25Z,Catherine Bennett,politics
"Well, I am actually quite tired but Dave says I must do the diary because it was our historic first Christmas and I suppose it is historically interesting to record that the prime minister's wife is expected to buy roughly one million presents for which I have had precisely one thank you, from dear Govey, saying it was his favouritest gift ever. Mummy says the other staff probably had photos of Dave already but God, I know what I would prefer compared with Gordon on Courage or those bottles of Stimulique massage oil that Carole Caplin used to brew up in the Blairs' Therapy Hut, no wonder there are stains everywhere. But I have totes forgiven Dave because he sweetly arranged a New Year party to make up for Thailand, so clever of him, because even if Phuket is way cheaper than Klosters it would have looked more luxe than Oik doing his Eurotrash number in that hideous scarf, so insensitive to people who can't afford scarves.

"It's January and everybody's on a diet, except that diets are undignified and nobody will admit to them, so instead they're going to the gym. It's an unimpeachable activity, sound from every angle. It is entirely logical: calories out exceed calories in (it's so simple, fatty. Can't you even count?) It is socially beneficial: think how much you save the NHS, with that cocktail of sweat, determination and foresight. It's not vanity, it's self-improvement. It's not a hobby, it's a moral act. Except that all this is a total swindle. The gym is so much greater a capitalist con than the casino, and yet so much more acceptable, so legitimate. How do they get away with it? Outdoor pursuits, from ladies jumping in Hampstead pond to adolescents running off their primal urges – anything that could be filed under ""fresh air"" – have always had exponents. But the bizarre fascinations of the gym – the airless, repetitive flexing and relaxing, the determined pointlessness, the feverish generation of sweat – none of this was even conceived of until the 60s. It was a fad. By the 80s, sensible people played racquet sports, and the only people who wore Lycra and star-jumped at random were fast-living young women who wanted to be Jane Fonda. Bill Clinton's treadmill habit was weird in 1992; now, imagine how weird it would be if Barack Obama didn't go to the gym. It has taken fewer than 20 years for aerobic (or, if you prefer to sound less girly, cardio) exercise to go from an urban fad to the very core of medical orthodoxy. Fruit, vegetables, gym: these are now the musketeers of good health. The fitness market was worth £682m in 1996, £1.6bn in 2001 and is now stable at £2.5bn (these are Mintel figures). In the UK, 5.2 million adults have membership of a private gym. That market penetration is phenomenal. I don't want to labour the point about how this correlates with obesity, because some people – myself, for instance – have membership and don't use it. But put it this way: whether we're using the gym or not, as a cohort, it's not making us any thinner. One of the reasons for this is that vigorous exercise stimulates your appetite. So a 20-minute run might use up 200 calories, but your hunger won't necessarily – indeed, almost certainly won't – restrain itself to that amount of extra food. Well then, use willpower to overcome the appetite. That might work, except that willpower is like a muscle (or, as Oliver Burkeman described it, ""a unitary, depletable resource""). You've already used your day's determination going to the gym in the first place: your ability to resist the temptations of your appetite is already diminished, even before that appetite has increased. Some doctors happily bandy about the importance of rigorous exercise, but experts on the obesity ""epidemic"" have been questioning this advice for ages, and rarely recommend anything more demanding than walking and cycling. This vexed area yields my favourite anti-capitalist conspiracy from a mainstream source. Steven Gortmaker, who heads the Harvard Prevention Research Centre on nutrition and physical activity, said this about playgrounds at fast-food restaurants: ""Why would they build those? … if a kid plays five minutes and burns 50 calories, he might then go inside and consume 500 calories."" Studies come out all the time showing that exercise doesn't make you thin. But gyms have become so central to our idea of what it means to take responsibility for oneself that sensible people write this evidence off as crank stuff emanating from academic troublemakers. In fact, sensible people should never even see the word ""gym"" without mentally ending the sentence ""stimulates appetite"". They are a good answer for elite athletes with specific muscular needs. Everybody else should just go for a walk, or – if that too seems pointless – take a walk to a particular destination. In one way, it doesn't matter. It is possible to be fit but fat, and exercise improves health – it's good for your heart, it has a prophylactic effect against a number of cancers. And yet the raison d'être of the private health club is the body beautiful. These places would have got nowhere had they flogged themselves as a long-term preventative measure against future heart attack. They had to appeal to vanity: the genius of gym culture was to dress up personal vanity in the sackcloth of good health, and thereby overcome all the natural, decent reservations we would have had about blowing 94 quid a month on a beauty regime that didn't even work. We should really be ashamed. There is no more obvious profligacy than spending money to pump out energy on treadmills, just to force us to consume more energy, none of which has any result that couldn't be replicated by taking a turn around the block. Never mind the Earth's resources, we should have more respect for our own resources. We ought to see the waste of our toil in the same terms as wasting food. As we set off for the gym, we should be able to hear the echo of our mums shouting: ""There are children in Africa who have to jog five miles up an incline every day!"" I hope they don't revoke my membership for saying this. I still like the sauna.",The gym is a genius con we should be ashamed to fall for | Zoe Williams,2011-01-05T20:30:00Z,Zoe Williams,society
"First it was the Abbey Road zebra crossing: not the exact patch of London street that the Beatles traversed in the summer of '69, but still considered iconic enough to be given Grade II listed status, thanks to a Tory heritage minister named John Penrose. Now the housing department is trying to intervene in the case of Ringo Starr's Liverpool birthplace, requesting the postponement of plans for its demolition and suggesting a ""big society""-style wheeze whereby local people will be asked how this small aspect of the legend might be reprieved and turned into a proper visitor attraction. The upshot is heartwarming, to say the least: they may want to leave the arts to the mercy of the market, and snatch books from mere babes – but if the memory of the Beatles is involved, this government knows what's at stake. The latter story centres on 9 Madryn Street, a 150-year-old terraced house in Dingle threatened by the last government's much-criticised housing market renewal programme for the last five years, and finally condemned by the city council last August. I am a Beatles obsessive, and have made the obligatory visit, though its relevance to anything has always seemed pretty questionable, even to the likes of me. Starr's family moved elsewhere a few years after he was born, which was presumably the rationale for English Heritage's recent refusal to give the house listed status, a decision framed in terms of its alleged lack of ""historic or architectural importance"". Now, though, the Tigger-ish Tory minister Grant Shapps wants ""local community groups to have the opportunity to put forward viable proposals to preserve this historic house"". This sudden groovy tilt to planning policy has its origins in the campaigning of local Beatles freaks, though it may also reflect an exotic detail in the minister's own backstory: Shapps's cousin is Mick Jones, the guitarist in the Clash. Such, anyway, is yet another episode in a story that has long since ballooned into absurdity: the transformation of the Beatles into a national religion – arguably bigger than Jesus, as John Lennon infamously put it. X Factor contestants must, by law, deliver warblesome readings of Let It Be and The Long and Winding Road; each time Sir Paul McCartney ventures out to hack out his versions of the hits, the public is encouraged to think something miraculous is afoot; Yoko Ono, bless her, keeps the posthumous Lennon machine grinding on. In Liverpool, meanwhile, delusions of post-industrialism have reached their apogee in the idea that Beatledom can be a substitute for a lost mercantile past. It's all there: John Lennon international airport, the Hard Day's Night Hotel, the ""Magical Mystery Tour"" that wends around the city, even a Fabs-themed Starbucks — though judging by the forlorn atmosphere of too many of the surrounding streets, Beatles-driven regeneration really isn't working. Funny, that. Prior to the mid-1990s, when the Beatles nostalgia industry finally found its feet and the Gallagher brothers glued their devotion into the culture, little of this existed. The long aftershocks of punk rock ensured the Beatles were still deemed rather uncool; given that Tony Blair had yet to waltz into Downing Street with his Fender Stratocaster, the establishment was barely interested in rock heritage. There was a Beatles tourist trail, of sorts – but it usually involved squinting at car parks or boarded-up shops, and trying to divine whatever spectral magic they had left behind. Moreover, the idea of the Beatles as all-dominating titans had yet to take root: well away from their legacy, music developed on its own terms. These days, by contrast, they use up so much of the cultural air that we seem little able to breathe. There must be more to life than nodding-dog piano ballads of the Hey Jude variety, but there are times when they seem to define a good 50% of the mainstream. For all their inventive wonderment, one would imagine that I Am the Walrus, Happiness Is a Warm Gun and Helter Skelter left at least some of rock's more creative possibilities unexplored, though listening to the bulk of even supposedly cutting-edge music, you'd never know. And consider what state-sponsored Fabs-worship is doing to our appreciation of their own work. Understanding their music's essentials – the liquid excitement of their early period, the creative daring in so much of what they did, the 1,000mph pace at which they developed – is made increasingly difficult by a great blanket of compulsory sentimentality. Put another way, we are reaching a point where a creation as jaw-dropping as, say, A Day in the Life is in danger of acquiring a leaden kind of tedium, like something from a school hymn book. The Beatles' magic is being crushed: sorry to bring up such grim eventualities, but after the great outpourings that will greet the passing of Paul and Ringo, there will surely be none left. In 1970, John Lennon said this: ""It's just a rock group that split up, it's nothing important – you can have all the records if you want to reminisce."" The words crumble next to his group's myth, but they also speak an undeniable truth — which is why the 72% of local people who are reportedly OK with the Madryn Street demolition ought to have their wishes respected, and life should go on. And one other thing: Ringo was the drummer, remember.",I am a Beatles obsessive. But let's cut the Fabs-worship | John Harris,2011-01-03T21:00:01Z,John Harris,uk
"In the film, Burlesque, Christina Aguilera plays a small-town girl with a dream. ""I just wanna sing wearing slutty knickers!"" Actually she doesn't say this, but she may as well have done. The makers of Burlesque may have been trying for the ambience of Cabaret or Moulin Rouge, but the result is a daytime soap opera with a few crummy basques thrown in. Christina frugging like she's had too much Fanta at the school disco. Cher smouldering like a half-melted candle. More basques, pants, boas, leatherette, doffed sparkly bowler hats, and tapped canes. A queasy mix of Showgirls meets Seaside Special. Shocking. But not in the way you'd think. Burlesque isn't a convention-defying movie about freedom, destiny, art; it is a boring movie about how nice your pants are. The theme of ""Cor, underwear!"" was so strong I sat in the cinema feeling like a teenage boy furtively perusing the bra section of his mum's Kays catalogue. However, despite all the lingerie on display, Burlesque isn't a movie about burlesque. This is burlesque served up as weed-porn, pitched at the precise level of woeful sub-titillation even women are deemed able to cope with. I once spoke to renowned burlesque star Dita Von Teese, a doll-like beauty with flashing intelligent eyes. She told me that, for all the artistry and tease, for all the effort she put into her routines, including her fabled bath in a giant martini glass, burlesque was just stripping, people who claimed otherwise were in denial. This seems to be the true burlesque – clever creative strippers who got so good at putting a twist on what they do they turned it into an art form. Yet in recent years burlesque seems to have fallen into the wrong hands, become restyled as sex with the safety brakes on, watered-down erotica that even women, Stephen Fry's pathetic sex-hating fools, can handle. On the plus side, this has led to much nicer ""burlesque-style"" underwear, even in M&S. On the minus, it led to the kind of stripping a guy can get away with watching with workmates because: ""It's not stripping, it's burlesque innit?"" Hey, its so sanitised they can even take the little lady along. Never mind that so many new burlesque clubs have sprung up recently that in many cases there's probably precious real difference between the knackered pole dancer getting notes stuffed into her thong elastic, and the ""burlesque artist"" shuffling about miserably in her Jean Harlow hairpiece and Ann Summers basque. Is this the real difference between stripping and burlesque – stripping is more honest? Men can't usually con their women into accepting stripping as an evening's entertainment the way they can with burlesque. However, men can't be blamed for this. The most offensive thing about the movie Burlesque was how obviously this tedious feeble sub-pornographic baloney was aimed straight at the ""ladeez"". I simply don't think men would lower themselves going to the cinema for a 12A-rated peek at Xtina grinding and hair tossing in the style of Miss Piggy on heat. Men wouldn't waste their time. The ones who are into porn have always stuck to their guns on this issue – they like the genuinely dirty stuff and that's that. You can't talk them out of it. It's not as if the internet has been getting any cleaner over the years. Therefore the lukewarm weed-porn of something such as Burlesque must be aimed directly at women. And you wonder: how did women get so welded to this idea of sex as a fashion opportunity? How did they allow themselves to get conned? The scratchy basques and tragic bowler hats of mainstream watered-down burlesque don't seem to be about female desire, or even male desire, rather female pleading and bartering for male desire. It makes Mr Fry look like he got it right. Zara and Mike – the really cool royal wedding Is Zara Phillips scamming the British public? Wearing my Miss Marple bonnet, it seems suspicious that she's marrying England rugby player, Mike Tindall, a month or so after, you know, that other do. It's almost as if the timing is on purpose because William and Kate will inevitably overshadow it, and they will have about 90% less royal wedding nonsense to deal with. In normal circumstances Zara would not have been able to escape the crazed speculation about her dress, ring, venue, cake, bridesmaids, vows, what honeymoon sex they might like to have, and the rest. This way, they could practically get away with her wearing a taffeta frock from Monsoon, and a scampi supper in a pub garden. Zara does seem rather down to earth – she didn't even get herself a manicure to show off her engagement ring to the media. There was a ticking off for that, but it was definitely half-hearted, unquestionably a sense of ""bigger fish to fry"". Genius. The happy royal couple (mark II) clearly thought: ""This is a good time to bury great news."" Zara and Mike, we salute you as the coolest royals ever. Go on, George. Give us a twirl Did George Osborne make a homophobic remark to gay Labour justice spokesman, Chris Bryant? At Treasury questions, Bryant berated Osborne about the cuts, likening him to Cinderella's father, Baron Hardup, adding that he could maybe think about playing Prince Charming instead. Osborne responded by shouting: ""At least I'm not the pantomime dame."" Cue politically correct tumbleweed bouncing across parliament. Osborne insisted it was a Christmas joke, while Bryant tweeted: ""So George Osborne clearly does not know how to be charming with his jibe at me as 'pantomime dame'. Homophobic or just nasty?"" Bryant later announced to a newspaper: ""I will survive,"" a phrase so evocative of Gloria Gaynor disco balls, I laughed so hard I ended up feeling slightly homophobic myself. Personally, I think the accusation of homophobia its stretching it a bit. Did I say a bit? I meant a lot. This was seasonal banter that went wrong. In part, Ed Miliband's fault, after he scored that big hit with his ""back end of a pantomime horse"" attack on Nick Clegg. Now everyone thinks they can pull off panto banter, which requires a modicum of wit and timing, which George, in all honesty, has never publicly pretended to possess. Even Bryant must admit that it's unlikely that Osborne is a raging homophobe, when he's one of the campest-looking men in British politics. Its George's mesmerising androgyny that drives the ladies wild. That porcelain skin, those pouty lips. Imagine him made up as a 1980s Boy George. It works, doesn't it? There lies the irony – Bryant would make a very poor Widow Twanky, but Osborne could dress up as a pantomime dame and no one would notice. They'd think he was a Tory hottie.",This sub-porn for ladeez is not my idea of erotica | Barbara Ellen,2010-12-25T23:02:00Z,Barbara Ellen,politics
"Ending the year with little to do except wait for the snow to melt and wonder where my Amazon orders might be, I have been trying to nail 2010's decisive catchphrase. ""I agree with Nick"" has become one of the most frequently used tropes on Comment is free threads, and has the added bonus of massive post-facto irony – but the unchallenged champion must surely be the Tory incantation that backhandedly captured where Britain has ended up: ""We're all in this together"". Self-evidently, what with bonus season looming while job centres are empowered to hand out food vouchers, we're not – something my new series Anywhere but Westminster is intended to explore. So, by way of extending the conversation slightly beyond simple matters of wealth and income, as 2010 ends, it's worth noting the wildly diverse experiences of various parts of the country. From where I'm sitting (the south-west, for what it's worth) one-nation Conservatism looks as distant a dream as ever, and Britain's divisions seem once again to be deepening, at speed. As it continues to bang away in the manner of a dull national headache, I've had my say about the north-south divide already: suffice to say that as we head into 2011 and the cuts kick in, the extent to which London and the south east sit apart from the rest of the country is only going to get worse. That's not a matter of leftist troublemaking: if you don't believe me, listen to the chief executive of Whitbread, who's in charge of such brands as Costa Coffee, Brewers Fayre and good old Premier Inn: ""It is definitely true that the London market is strong and it is definitely true that in the regional market life is tougher,"" he reckons. ""I would expect that to continue."" In other words, macchiatos, pub lunches and awaydays all round in the capital – but in your Boltons, Bradfords and Burys, times are hard, and getting harder. That said, the more pinched parts of the capital and south should not be forgotten. This, after all, was the year that such towns as Southend and Hastings became bywords for the likely exodus caused by the government's proposed cap on housing benefit (since delayed for existing claimants, though the predicted shifts in population will surely happen as of January 2012). And soon after that story grabbed the headlines, there came further proof of what a divided city London is. Thanks to Eric Pickles's cuts to local government funding, the three biggest losers will be Hackney, Tower Hamlets and Newham, all of whom have been hit with reductions of between 8.9%; among those who will only suffer the merest pain are such places as Dorset (0.25%), Surrey (0.31%) and Buckinghamshire (0.6%). But to truly grasp what a sliced-up country we are, consider some other stories. When other parts of Britain are squealing their pain, people from Essex seem to be having a great time: as a recent Guardian shortcut pointed out, the county gave us the winners of Strictly Come Dancing and I'm A Celebrity, as well as the fastest-selling non-fiction book ever (though before anyone gets too carried away, let us bear in mind the London-Essex borders, and the ongoing travails of Barking and Dagenham). By contrast, Cumbria suffered the long aftermath of 2009's floods and an earthquake, Cornwall was once again swamped, and the list of what we have to call ""unemployment blackspots"" was headed by Middlesbrough, Liverpool, south Wales, and the often-overlooked Isle Of Wight. Thus, millions of us end the year living on different metaphorical planets. I've been quoting Dickens a lot lately, so I may as well carry on; as Tiny Tim put it: 'God bless us, every one!' But maybe start with Hastings, Hackney, Toxteth and Teesside first, eh?","Instead of one-nation Conservatism, we are getting a two-tier Britain | John Harris",2010-12-24T12:01:18Z,John Harris,politics
"The world is mad. Most Britons have, like me, just enjoyed the most glorious weather of the year. The western shores of the British Isles have seen a week of almost continuous sun, open horizons and star-filled nights. Freezing air has kept the early snow from melting. With brief exceptions, main roads have been open and supplies plentiful. An exquisite Christmas beckons, with snowy slopes and blues skies, a photographic negative from the usual greens and greys. So what is the Britain we have read about in the papers and watched on the news, one of relentless, total misery? It must be one that is enmeshed in London and can't stay still. It is a metropolis of the damned, hyper-mobile, frantically trying to get into or away from itself, stranded in motorways and on railway platforms, entombed in detention centres that claim to be airports. The inhabitants all incant, ""I was only trying to get away for Christmas"", to a chorus of ""When is the government going to do something?"" An aviation company was even quoted as claiming it was Whitehall's job to keep it supplied with de-icing equipment. Absurd though it may seem, Downing Street on Tuesday accepted the charge, explaining that its response was as serious as that of the Cobra emergency planning committee. Not to be outdone, the security lobby made its annual Christmas appeal, seeking to wipe out what remains of the retail sector with ""warnings of terrorist attacks this Christmas"". Even the Department of Health joined in the hysterics with news of the return of its perennial Black Death – swine flu. The Heathrow airport boss, Colin Matthews, even said he would ""give up [his] bonus"" because of the snow. Most travellers could not care less about his bonus: they want a plane. As for the bonus, the truth is out. It is apparently no longer a reward for exceptional achievement. It is standard remuneration on top of salary, at risk only if it snows and is considered a risk to public relations. Last year's transport secretary, Lord Adonis, gave a lesson in cynicism by complaining, now he's out of power, that this year's chaos is ""making Britain look like a third world country"". No it is not. It is making Britain look like a country that has just been hit by an exceptionally fierce blizzard, one that is bound to throw everything out of kilter unless you are Inuit. As for pretending it is the government's fault, are we to congratulate ministers when the sun shines? Seen from the more restful provinces, the one-third of car owners who, according to surveys, ""expect to be on the move"" during the holiday is wholly unreasonable in its expectations. To equip Britain's transport system to handle an occasional bout of snow would be absurd, though it is an absurdity the transport secretary is contemplating. Philip Hammond has been browbeaten by sufferers from acute seasonal mobility disorder, and by their media cheerleaders. It would be gratifying if, just once, a transport secretary had the nerve to stand up and tell everyone that when the weather is bad it is a good idea to leave their cars in the garage, tear up their rail passes, forget Marbella and tuck up at home with a good book. They should see their loved ones some other time. Normality cannot be guaranteed. Every journalist knows that the only good news is bad news, especially when it is about Vince Cable or Strictly Come Dancing, or both. This Christmas the maxim has gone too far. It presents a false picture of ordinary people. From my perusal of the weather records, most people are experiencing a delightful break, chiefly by not attempting to move. To those of us on the western shores, the chief risk just now is of sunburn.",This glorious winter weather | Simon Jenkins,2010-12-23T19:30:01Z,Simon Jenkins,uk
"The mistake I make with Alan Sugar is to think he won't suffer fools gladly. It's because he says it so often, like the sociopath who says ""I'm not very nice, and you should take my poor manners as a signal of my superior intelligence"". In fact he suffers fools perfectly well, which is how Stella English came to win The Apprentice. Actually, I have no idea whether she's a fool or not – there's so much evidence on both sides (isn't wanting to work for Sugar in the first place inherently foolish?). But this was her crowning argument: ""Chris [Bates, her rival] is an intelligent guy but I don't think he's got the passion that I've got. Anything I want I will get, I won't let go. That's a passion that enables you to do things that you never thought were possible."" Surely that won't wash, with the shark-eyed, self-certified detector of bullshit? ""I deserve it because I want it the most""? This is stalker's logic. It wouldn't even fly on The X Factor, and The Apprentice is supposed to be the thinking person's talent show. But no, the government-sponsored greybeard conceded – even though both candidates wanted it a lot, this one should get it because she wanted it the most. OK, maybe at a stretch business is different from other jobs. Business, politics, alternative medicine: there are fields in which self-belief is indivisible from talent, in which there's no such thing as a gift, there's only a will. But even on MasterChef and Come Dine With Me, even on Strictly Come Dancing, passion is the mantra. What happened to just being good at something? A number of things have happened: it has become vulgar to claim you have any talent. Some X Factor contestants will say ""I'm the best!"", but they're deliberately setting themselves up as the comedy braggart. Arrogance isn't attractive; everybody wants to be popular; that's reasonable enough. You can say your drive is greater than other people's and it doesn't sound arrogant. On the contrary, it sounds plucky, self-abnegating and a bit vulnerable. This is fallacious – it's not self-effacing at all to esteem your own desires so highly that you assume they must be greater than everybody else's and, furthermore, that in a fair universe they can't be thwarted. But for some reason it works – even Barack Obama does it. He had a passion to lead the American people; his vice-president had to have a passion to make American people's lives better. It's daft, since passion is the one quantity in any given competition in which all finalists are probably about equal. If you were to stand up and say ""vote for me because I'm the most intelligent"", that would, de facto, make you more intelligent than the person who was claiming to be more passionate. You wouldn't even have to take an IQ test. But I'm not sure it would result in more votes. This passion lexicon is also based on an availability bias. We see successful people in the world, and ask – incessantly, it's like envy-Tourettes – how they did it. They often use drive as a post hoc explanation. Even athletes, people in whom desire is a necessary but laughably insufficient criterion, go on about their devotion to the sport, presumably because it is the one thing they have that's universal. They don't want to make us all feel bad about our mediocre thighs. There are plenty of failures who wanted success very badly as well but are never canvassed for their views because they're such losers. As obvious as that bias is, it's still powerfully misleading. But those factors have been around since for ever. They don't explain the sudden explosion of passion as a force to be reckoned with, an immeasurable quality of no clear value, which nevertheless demands to be taken extremely seriously. It's all down to the great self-esteem swindle. Two major forces peddle the idea that self-esteem is crucial. Politicians everywhere on the spectrum, so long as it's near the middle, love the idea of self-esteem because if all the barriers to a person's progress are erected by their own psyche, well first, that is quite cheap to fix and second, it's not even society's duty to fix it. The fixing has to come from within. From advertising, the motivation is more textured: we all accept that advertisements make us feel bad about ourselves, so we think we need improvements that we actually don't need and won't work anyway. Yet insecurity on its own is not enough. It's more likely to make us retreat than it is to make us consume. Every message of inadequacy has to be teamed with a message of self-love. The more absurd the product, the more lavish the encouragement. You can do it! You are worth it! You do deserve it! Over time, at such volume, this message has been incredibly effective – there's an American study that asked teenagers to agree or disagree with the statement ""I am a very important person"". In the fifties, 12% agreed. In the nineties, it was 80%. This doesn't equate to actual self-esteem, however, it just flips the domino for a cascade of meaningless statements: I am important, I believe in myself, I can get anything I want so long as I want it badly enough, the sincerity and force of my passion can know no equal, and therefore I deserve it. Whatever it is. Because I want it. It might wash with Alan Sugar. It shouldn't wash with anybody else.","I deserve it because I want it the most.

"The ceremony on Friday night was exemplary. The chair of the Nobel judges, Thorbjorn Jagland, left the prize on the empty chair that should have been occupied by the imprisoned human rights activist Liu Xiaobo, had the Chinese authorities allowed him – or his wife – to travel to Norway to accept it. An audience including some of the world's most august people offered a standing ovation. There was a haunting violin recital of Chinese music. The same could not be said of China's behaviour. It was stung into a diplomatic and propaganda campaign against the Nobel committee that has reached new heights of ham-fistedness. For everything China has done over this affair has been ill thought-out and self-defeating. The regime must be very fearful indeed about the potential of the society on which it has been sitting for years to erupt – and the surprisingly lively pro-democracy movement to go viral – for it to mobilise against one solitary activist to such an extent. What we have witnessed is not the strength of a new great power in the making as today's China is commonly understood – but profound and psychotic weakness. China's anti-peace prize campaign is born of deep apprehension of its own vulnerability and lack of legitimacy. China improbably claimed that the award was to a criminal, and thus mocked the Chinese legal system that had convicted him to 11 years' imprisonment. It campaigned to persuade countries not to attend the ceremony, with the implicit promise of reward for those who conformed and penalties for those who did not. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Russia duly obliged. It has cracked down on its domestic dissidents with even more force and paranoia than usual. And it launched its own rival Confucius peace prize as a symbol of Asian values and priorities. This was meant to reinforce the idea that there was now a new global centre of economic and cultural power anchored in non-western values based in Asia in general and China in particular. But the Confucius peace prize was a complete fiasco. It was awarded to a Beijing stooge, the former Taiwanese vice-president Lien Chan. He then did not turn up to accept it, so the organisers turned to the trusty notion of asking a garishly lipsticked six-year-old girl to accept the prize in his stead as symbol of innocence. What had been designed as a celebration of Confucianism ended up highlighting its embedded flaws. Today, in its name, the Chinese state can set up an alternative peace prize and award the alleged honour to whom it pleases in a completely opaque process. If this represents Asian values, the world should shiver. The party has a long record of opportunistically exploiting Confucianism to shore up its appeal. Liu Shaoqi, in the 1940s one of the five-strong leadership group around Mao, argued that the essence of becoming an effective communist was the same as becoming a good Confucian – inner steel, self-criticism and self-discipline. Yet even while he wrote, the same party could damn Confucianism for trapping China in hidebound pre-modern traditions, corruption and suffocating poverty. Today that criticism is forgotten. The party now needs Confucianism too much to dare to be critical. Part of the overreaction to Liu Xiaobo is that the party leadership knows that regime change in the Confucian Imperial era always came through revolt from below – and that when Liu Xiaobo dismisses President Hu Jintao as leader of ""the communist mafia"" he combines effective and highly personal attacks on the new communist mandarinate with principled adherence to human rights and constitutional democracy. This was the position of Sun Yat-sen, who toppled the dynasty in 1911, appealing to universal values. The danger is obvious. If the strains in the economy were less acute, the party could be more relaxed. But China escaped the full force of the world recession only by resorting to a reckless credit-driven expansion; state-owned banks have near doubled their lending in just three years. As a result, today's Chinese banking system has trillions of dollars of non-performing debts that make the US and UK banking system in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis look positively sound. The world economy cannot absorb the volume of Chinese exports; there is not the demand. The gravely unbalanced Chinese economy is a bubble about to pop. It needs root and branch reform – reforms that go to the very foundations of communist rule. But without economic growth the regime has no prop on which to rely; if it cannot provide jobs and the prospect of prosperity, its only rationale is that it alone can hold the vast country together. This is no longer a party that can plausibly argue it is the custodian of a communist revolution; nor is it a party legitimised by the ballot box. It was the conjuncture of economic difficulties, notably inflation, and legitimacy that ignited Tiananmen in 1989 – and many senior officials, including the likely next Chinese president Xi Jinping's father, were very sympathetic to the protesters' demands because one way or another China had to find its way to legitimate government. For 20 years the arguments have been put on ice. Xi Jinping is the leading candidate of the fifth generation of China's leaders to succeed Hu; but it was the fifth generation of leaders in the Soviet Union who found that the lack of legitimacy, five generations after the revolution, plus endemic economic problems were unmanageable. The conservatives in the party do not know whether to trust Xi Jinping; he could be, given his father's views, China's Gorbachev – ready to bust open the Chinese political system. And Liu Xiaobo could be China's Andrei Sakharov – the Russian human rights activist given the Nobel peace prize in 1975 just before the fifth generation of Soviet leaders took over, but only to disband the Soviet Union because there was no other way forward. Xi Jinping cannot take the succession, which could yet be very bloody, for granted. This is how to understand the mobilisation by the world's second biggest economic power against one human rights activist. The big political actors in China have not spoken out, leaving the statements and explanations to minor foreign office spokespeople. They want to keep their powder dry for bigger battles. It is lonely arguing that China is in deep economic and political trouble. But what has happened over Liu Xiaobo suggests that there are some in agreement – the men at the top of the Chinese Communist party.","China's fury over the Nobel showed weakness, not strength | Will Hutton",2010-12-12T15:51:00Z,Will Hutton,world
"The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Tuesday 14 December 2010  The epigram: ""If I can't dance I don't want to be part of your revolution"", quoted by a columnist on Saturday, was incorrectly attributed to Rosa Luxemburg. The true origin of the phrase is an incident in the autobiography of Emma Goldman, the anarchist.   Good old Morrissey should keep his quiff stiff and not worry too much about whether David Cameron likes the Smiths or not. Though Big Mouth Strikes Again, for he has ranted at length about why he did not not write Meat is Murder or The Queen is Dead for the likes of fragrant Dave. You don't say? He was supporting his erstwhile bandmate Johnny Marr, who had simply tweeted, ""David Cameron, stop saying you like the Smiths, no you don't. I forbid you to like it."" I have every sympathy, but once your music is out there in the world, rather like your kids, you have no control over its strange new friends. Even Morrissey admitted in his rant that music is ""a universal language"" and ""belongs to all"". Indeed it does, and this week prime minister's questions turned into a pub quiz, with Labour MP Kerry McCarthy and Cameron trading Smiths song titles in an exchange about tuitions fees. Students liked the Smiths! Geddit? Cameron also professes to liking the Jam's Eton Rifles – or Eating Trifles as we used to sing in my house. That time Paul Weller objected: ""Which part of it doesn't he get?"" At least Cameron may have heard these songs, unlike Gordon Brown and his Arctic Monkeys fiasco. If you didn't think things could get any worse than that, let me tell you they can. I go to the party political conferences every year, and every year the music gets more inappropriate. Political conferences are full of people who get drunk and dance on carpets in hotels. I am not saying all of them are devoid of discrimination when it comes to music, but let's put it this way: I am not voting for a party that cannot get a decent playlist together. I'm with Rosa Luxemburg. If I can't dance I don't want to part of your revolution. Call me superficial, call me a snob, call me a bloke – but music matters, and I don't trust people who don't think it's important. No one expects the Tories to be sussed, even though this year they had a stab at inoffensive preppy modernity with Vampire Weekend and the Killers. Sorry, but I can't hear the Killers without hearing Bill Bailey's brilliant riff on their meaningless ""I've got soul but I'm not a soldier"" lyric, which he has as ""I've got ham but I'm not a hamster"". Labour did my head in. It always does. I got there early for the leadership announcement, and as usual Labour went quite ravey. One expects them to hand out MDMA instead of graphs about SureStart. One year they played Right Here, Right Now even though Norman Cook was vociferously against the Iraq war. Most of the people around me seemed not to care about the music, rather about whether it was going to be Ed or Dave. But I couldn't not listen. Van Morrison and then Cockney Rebel? ""It's just a test/ A game for us to play/ Win or lose/ It's hard to smile/ Resist, resist/ It's from yourself you have to hide."" What a lovely track to play as we waited for fratricide! Still, the best was yet to come. All around me stood to cheer Gordon Brown. I was in shock. He was coming on stage to Soul Man (Sam & Dave not James Brown). ""Comin' to you/ On a dusty road/ Good lovin'/ I got a truckload"". Whoa Gordon – I'm a soul man, yes I am! Who chose this? Peter (Dancing Queen) Mandelson or Alastair (Ne Me Quitte Pas) Campbell? Wasn't the key issue dogging Brown's leadership his, er … lack of soul? Reading accounts of all this afterwards, in a hotel lobby playing an easy listening version of Pretty Vacant, I realised I was a fish out of water. Music doesn't matter to these guys – it is simply something to induce mood. What was I expecting? Sunn 0)))? Still, I can never accept the divide between political culture and actual culture. Right here, right now, we are in the midst of all sorts of exciting protests. Where is that soundtrack? The last time the Tories were in power we had the Specials and the Pop Group, but I don't want to look back, I want to look forward. We see protest music nostalgically because we define it so narrowly. Music of protest is seen as belonging to the past. Sure, no one is going to write Neil Young's Ohio again, or Give Peace a Chance. But Jarvis Cocker did write Common People. A key anthem. Look at hip-hop, at Jay-Z, Kanye and Public Enemy, never mind the more underground stuff, and tell me this is not music of protest. Look at the new folk scene. Unsurprisingly, our top politicians' musical choices don't stray into what is politely referred to these days as urban music – ie, black music. The riskiest stuff they go for is a bit of Bowie and some glum Radiohead. Cameron didn't choose any Roxy Music, despite Bryan and Otis's penchant for killing wild animals. But perhaps he doesn't remember A Song for Europe. At a civil liberties event a couple of years back, Brian Eno turned up to speak, and most people in the green room didn't know he was. ""It's Eno,"" I kept saying. ""You know, Roxy? Ambient?"" They didn't. These serious political types. Eventually I persuaded some security guy to let him onstage. What is so odd to me is this lack of musical curiosity. It is as if the political classes have erased their youth. Yet we distrust politicians without ""hinterland"". William Hague (teenage Meat Loaf fan) suffered from precisely this. But then when one happens on a politician who does like music, it's unsettling. My mate ended up next to Geoff Hoon at a Dylan concert. Quite spoiled it for him. Then Hoon, when not defending cluster bombing, found time to write paeans to Pink Floyd! Set my controls for the heart of the sun. There is no accounting for taste. And I would prefer a Hoon to the Blairs, who were the epitome of naffness. It's hard to imagine them, or Brown, ever Lost in Music – even the Fall's magnificent version. I am not a tyrant. Not everyone has to like what I like, but I can't imagine a better world without a better soundtrack. And isn't it telling that Ken Clarke, everyone's favourite Tory, didn't care about fashion or focus groups when he did Desert Island Discs a few years ago? He just picked what we know he gets off on: Charlie Parker, Bessie Smith, Thelonious Monk and John Coltrane. I like the courage of his convictions. Those without musical ones are suspect to me. But then, I will always be 15. And there will always be Motörhead. And their new single, Get Back in Line, has just arrived! ""We live on borrowed time/ Hope turned to dust/ Nothing is forgiven/ We fight for every crust … Why do we vote for faceless dogs?/ We always take the bait/ All things come to he who waits/ But all things come too late."" All this to a video with Lemmy and co taking a baseball bat to some bankers. The only thing that could spoil that for me is finding out it's on George Osborne's iPod.","You think David Cameron's bad, Morrissey?

"At the fashion awards everyone was saying direct action really is the new black, sit-ins are so fun, and Tamara is having her Knightsbridge shop done out with actual students for Christmas, *jealous*. So how typical is it that just when protest is having a moment, Dave has to be prime minister? The second I got home I was like, really, I have to protest, just a tiny bit, because honestly look what nuclear weapons did for Katharine Hamnett, some of us do have a business to run. Dave just went sorry babes, the rules say you can't flashmob and be PM, as if, men are literally so literal. I can't even do the Topshop one because we are pretending to be best friends with Philip Green. Well of course Anya is uber smug because she's created these divine totes with genuine student slogans, so you can protest and shop at the same time, but with a luxe twist. And Lily Cole is channelling Gandhi and Jemima is doing WikiLeaks and apparently Anna Wintour was kettled last week in Selfridges' Shoe Galleries. They say Vivienne Westwood might even take her pants off again. But the closest I get to a protest is listening to Honest Phil when he rings to say he knew he shouldn't of sodding got into bed with us what do we call this fucking anarchy in the UK, the wife's going mental and Dave had better effing call him back or somebody's legs are going to get broken. So we are sending Cleggsy round because Dave is still busy dealing with those Smiths now the Morris one is saying Marr was right to ban Dave from liking them because Dave likes hunting stags. Well Julian Fellowes very sweetly said what do you expect from people called Smith, but it was still upsetting because until Dave gave them a mention no one had ever heard of them, and now Haguey and Govey and Hunty all sing ""I'm feeling very sick and ill today"", each time Cleggsy walks in, so hilarious.

"In one of his best-known essays, Francis Bacon had ""jesting"" Pilate ask: ""What is truth?"", but the Roman who condemned Christ to the cross ""would not stay for an answer"". Pilate might just as well have asked what is fair and found the answer even more cloaked in ambiguity. For everyone has their own definition. In tough times, when people's interests are stark, the what-is-fair question rises up. Who is deserving or undeserving of great reward? Is there common ground on which to make a judgment? So what is fair? I've been considering this for the last six months while working on the first phase of a report on how to achieve fair pay in the public sector, along with any implications for ""social norms"" in the private sector, at the behest of the prime minister and chancellor. My answer is that people expect their reward to rise in proportion to their effort and contribution, recognise they should not be rewarded for luck and want the process to be impartial. But they also concede that in organisations others contribute, so no single person can claim to scoop the pool of reward. Fair pay has an upper boundary. Hence the case for at the very least tracking and monitoring a measure of how pay is distributed between the top and bottom . One feasible way of turning this principle into reality would be a 20:1 multiple between top and bottom pay in the public sector, which I was asked to investigate. But as I vainly tried to make clear last week, on the publication of the interim report, defining the ""1"" and the "" 20"" is fraught with problems. This is a minefield; almost any way forward risks being accused of being too prescriptive, too arbitrary or, if you believe public sector pay at the top is out of control, too ineffective. On the other hand, the status quo does not work either. There is no robust framework for judging whether top pay is deserved, which in the public sector is spending hard-earned taxpayers' pounds and where there has been growing concern about some eyecatching pay deals. So, what to do? First some facts. Despite concern about ""fat cat"" public sector pay, only £1 in every £100 taken by the top 1% of Britain's earners at the moment goes to public sector people. While there has been a revolution in private sector top pay, the ratio of pay between top and bottom in the military, police and central civil service has been remarkably moderate and stable. But as central control weakens and the reformed public sector wins more private sector-style autonomy to help drive innovation, such as foundation trusts or universities, the more pay at the top has begun to climb faster than pay at the bottom. Nothing yet matches the growth of private sector CEO pay, but the trends are a warning. The market in top people's pay is different. It is hard to get comparable data spanning the last 25 years in the private sector, but judging by one consistent sample, overall CEO compensation has probably jumped by around eight times in the last generation. In the last 10 years alone, it has risen two-and-a-half times. Half of CEO compensation is now in the form of shares in order to incentivise managers to behave aggressively in the shareholder interest. Britain, following the US, has created a new class of manager share-owners at the top of our companies who are being offered an unparalleled scale of compensation to do what used to be considered their job. It is not completely illogical. Britain's top companies are larger, more complex and generally better managed than they were a generation ago; some part of the rise in CEO pay is plainly deserved. But, equally plainly, not all. Few believe there has been a two-and-a-half times improvement in British corporate performance over the last 10 years or, as the average size and complexity of firms has been broadly stable over the same period, whether such a rise in pay is deserved. There are two problems with the CEO jobs market. The first is the new fashion for the superstar CEO who allegedly alone can transform a company's fortunes. It is all too easy to promise whatever amount of shares – apparently cost free – to persuade the CEO to join the company. But the second problem is even more acute. Even as executive pay rockets, it makes no sense for any one firm to stand out against the trend. It needs to pay for the best, not least because of the signal it sends – even if the joint outcome is a pay arms race where collectively CEO pay has become increasingly detached from performance. It is not deserved, it is not fair. Shareholders are plainly worried and have launched a revolution in British corporate governance to help redress the issue. But it has not made a shred of difference. Something else is needed better to link rising pay to due desert – both for shareholders and the wider society. After all, the evidence is that unfair companies and unfair societies in the long run fare poorly. Nor is the public sector an island. It needs talented people. But if the rewards look as if they are in near-permanent decline, fewer will come forward, even allowing for the vocational value of doing public service. Already there is a dangerous talent gap below the current leadership across the public sector, and when private sector professionals are recruited it is nearly always at an inflationary premium. Meanwhile, public sector performance languishes. Productivity is difficult to measure but it looks as though it may have declined between 1997 and 2007, the latest years for which there are any numbers. New Labour frantically tried to turn the trend round and now the coalition government is looking to yet more autonomy, more incentives, more quasi markets and even John Lewis-style employee partnerships to lift performance. The risk is obvious: Britain could follow the US and have a public sector locked in a downward vortex of underperformance, poor pay and a falling talent pool, which becomes a depressant on the entire economy and society. Addressing performance is unlikely without lifting senior executive pay. The danger is that the market in top public executives could start to resemble the arms race market in top private executive pay and no amount of improved corporate governance – the current official policy stance – could hold the line. There needs to be more bite – the case for an indicative upper multiple beyond which public bodies should not pay – or those bodies should be required to explain why. The stakes are high. Britain needs to drive up the performance of its public sector and keep its top public sector pay fair. And no less urgently the private sector needs to get a grip on the CEO pay arms race in the name of a better, more productive and fairer capitalism. There are risks with reform and tracking pay multiples. But the bigger risk is doing nothing.",Rein in the fat cat salaries or see public services suffer even more | Will Hutton,2010-12-05T00:09:07Z,Will Hutton,society
"Regarding England's failed 2018 World Cup bid, what is there left to do but paraphrase the immortal words of the Streets: ""Dry your eyes, mate. I know it's hard to take, but their minds have been made up."" Before I am accused of not taking it seriously enough, may I make it quite clear that I'm not taking it seriously at all. Not because I dislike football, or support Fifa, but because, this past week, too many people including an heir to the throne and a prime minister have been taking it all rather too seriously. If I see one more sulky, wronged English face attached to this story, I'll be forced to kick a football at it. It's time for some perspective, a few notches above scrawling: ""We wuz robbed!"" on Sepp Blatter's forehead in felt-tip. England weren't even close: we got two votes, one of which was from ourselves, a fact which, alone, would normally make the entire nation burst into self-deprecating laughter. After more build-up than Tom Cruise's stacked heels, we've been globally humiliated as the fat kid picked last for games. Don't tell me this isn't funny. And don't huff: ""This isn't about losing, it's about Fifa corruption."" Oh it is now, is it? Correct me if I'm wrong, but when I woke up on Thursday morning, the failed bid was all the media's fault. In particular, Panorama, which screened an investigation into Fifa corruption days before the vote. A cry went up that this was pivotal in ruining England's chances. ""Couldn't they have just sat on the information they had, put the Panorama edition on another time, when it wouldn't have affected the bid?"" Well, not really. It would have taken a particular brand of documentary maker hellbent on avoiding ""newsworthiness"". I believe they are known in the industry as ""unemployed"". What was this saying anyway – ""goals before truth"", appease Fifa, when allegations suggest we should be seriously considering ex-communicating Fifa? Then the mood abruptly changed: it was Fifa's fault after all! Hurrah! The chief executive for the England bid, Andy Anson, said there was no point in bidding again. Acting FA chairman, Roger Burden, withdrew his application for the permanent position because of Fifa. Our Three Lions – David Beckham, Prince William and David Cameron – queued up effectively to say something along the lines of: ""They were lied to, s'not fair, they're going to tell their mams on them."" No one seems to be stating the obvious, as in, persuasive as the actual bid was, and even if there weren't dodgy goings on, did England truly deserve to win? Over ""mafia"" Russia, ""oil-laden"" Qatar or even fellow losers in the two-tiered bid-a-thon, such as Australia, Belgium and Holland? Maybe we should accept that, in a fair situation, countries which have never hosted before should be given a chance. With the Olympics and the royal wedding, it's not as if we are short of a do, if you like that kind of thing, and some people don't. (How long before the moaning about cost, disruption and overkill would have started?) Moreover, those with a ""we deserved it"" mindset really should look at our national side, currently making the Bash Street Kids resemble Barcelona. If this continues, ""football crazy"" Wills won't be wanting proudly to showcase the England squad in 2018. He will be sending them off to the Tower. The real reason I refuse to take it too seriously is that all is not lost. If England need a revenge fantasy then let it be, you know, winning, scoring goals, not missing penalties, stuff like that. Fifa, at its most venal, couldn't ""smash that dream"". As most people would choose England winning the World Cup rather than hosting it, it's the perfect riposte, so what exactly is stopping us? England, you say? Surely not.  Mick Hucknall offers an ugly truth about fame Is anyone else bewildered by Mick Hucknall apologising to the ""thousands"" of groupies he's had sex with over the years, sometimes at the rate of three a day? Surely they just want to forget? Hucknall has self-diagnosed abandonment issues, but never mind the psychological analysis. He seems to be a prime example of the ugly guy who views fame as a beauty treatment. I came across Ugly Guy Shagger Syndrome (UGSS) many times as a music journalist. Sometimes, it was if someone had put an oozing teenage pimple into a Petri dish and grown an entire band out of it. Whereas a pretty boy such as Gareth Gates would actually deny having sex with Jordan, UGSS sufferers always tried to get through as many women as possible before loss of fame ""de-beautified"" them again. It's a guy thing, because female artists don't get high-calibre male groupies, unless you're into virgin mouth-breathers with feathered hair wearing My Chemical Romance T-shirts. If famous men want to boast about their sexual conquests, then they should just do it and put up with the reaction of: ""Ugh – stop sharing."" They shouldn't cloak their bragging in bogus regret, which nobody believes anyway. Why are teachers allergic to snow? You know you're past it when the snow arrives and instead of ""Wahey!"" or even ""How delightfully picturesque"", your immediate thought is: ""I'm going to fall over. And then I will die."" All week, I've been stumbling along streets, head down on black ice alert. I've perfected the ""safe walk"" where I stamp down with each step, as if mashing grapes, while holding my arms out like a penguin. It's deeply sexy. In an effort not to fall over, I'm also indulging in a great deal of random clutching – walls, lamp posts, postmen, small children, the elderly. It's as if I've become a snow Tory – screw everyone else, it's all about me! At least my daughter's school stayed open. On my ungainly outings, I couldn't help but notice a lot of children not in school uniform enjoying an authorised skive. Their parents, also plodding about like penguins, looked miserable and who could blame them? If our school managed to stay open, then surely so could theirs? Never mind work disruption, which is bad enough, it's time schools realised their role in childcare. This ""It's snowing, let's shut"" approach just isn't on. Nor is trying to make parents feel bad about not wanting to spend more time with their children. Most of us are absolutely fine about not wanting to spend more time with our children and we're absolutely fine with you knowing it. For us, shame is another country. Open the damn school. The next time your school is closed for no apparent reason, then it's time for a parental fightback. Knock on the doors of a teacher's home and when they open, chuck in the children, with a chirpy cry of ""Back at 3!"" That school will never close again.","Win the World Cup, boys, not the right to hold it | Barbara Ellen",2010-12-05T00:07:33Z,Barbara Ellen,uk
"I can't believe I laughed when people said being prime minister could sometimes be quite stressful because they are actually so right. Poor Dave really didn't like being called lightweight and inexperienced and only thinking about himself – plus that was ages before he really did cancel our holiday in Thailand so we will have Christmas in that poxy old rat's nest the Blairs thought was so bloody marvellous. Underneath he is so sensitive, just this week he asked if I would like a foot massage and it turned out Cable really is a natural podiatrist. And if Dave is lightweight I said well lucky me because what has Obama ever done besides boring on, politics is not everything, look at kitchens and the whole Issa debate. I mean this week Anya and Tamara and me have been like the Moral Maze discussing if there is ever any justification for Uggs, even when it's minus zero and they are unrecognisably embellished. Although poor Dave was going ancient history babes, end of, I could tell he was too upset to focus which was such a pity because it was the night Gillian McKeith got voted out and normally we would have been going yay, loving the extreme humiliation loser. Instead he was just going pinker and pinker, and literally glued to his iPad, and I was slightly freaking because Liam says it is vital that he doesn't explode and playing Angry Birds just seems to make him worse and we must find a game that calms him down. Well I texted Oik who said Club Penguin normally does the trick for him but Dave was like so insulted because apparently he's already in Elite Penguin Force and Oik hasn't even furnished his igloo yet? So thank goodness he was off to Zurich because Prince William was desperate for help with this unbelievably taxing app called GodFinger and Beckham has been trying to Christmas-theme Doodle Jump for months, so Dave didn't get to play Angry Birds the whole time he was saving football from the BBC and they did certainly did not think he was lightweight at all.

"     Cheap Street is a compact, pedestrianised thoroughfare that gently cuts through the centre of Frome, the 25,000-population Somerset town that sits between Bath and Glastonbury. Almost every one of its shops is independently run, and their windows are full of evidence of a bustling local society: gigs, playgroups, Saturday markets, guitar lessons, eco-organisations, and more. Last summer my partner and I sat outside a cafe and made the snap decision to move here from Wales – and if anywhere else starts to exert any kind of pull, this is a good place to once again get our heads straight. Frome has plenty of problems – pockets of hardscrabble disadvantage, the long legacy of de-industrialisation – but there are not many places like it any more: vibrant, diverse, brilliantly different. But the town feels way more fragile than it did a year ago. Here, the media class's talk of slow and sluggish growth is matter of hard reality, and the number of empty shops edges up by the week. Traders who are still in business say the recession still feels as if it's in full effect, and the prospect of an imminent VAT hike hardly raises any spirits. Worse still, thanks to Somerset's Tory-run county council, the cuts will soon bite with awful ferocity. Those voices – including some in the Guardian – who imagine a dreamy kind of creative destruction whereby austerity will forge a better future should come and have a look around. The local library is under threat, and the volunteers who see to Frome's version of the ""big society"" are adjusting to life in a very cold climate. Youth services are being hacked down by 73%, subsidies for buses by half – and, as already reported in the national press, arts grants by 100%. Yesterday morning a council news-sheet came through our door with word of a clever new approach to social care: ""We will provide better information to the public so that people can help themselves."" The town's Lib Dem MP accuses the council of an ""over-aggressive and unnecessary"" approach to its financial problems, and he has a point. But having dutifully taken a ministerial gig (as deputy leader of the House), David Heath inevitably has less room to talk than he used to. A spurt of vox-popping prompts the same refrains, over and over: ""Frome's getting worse … Too many shops are closing … the place is having a hard time."" Between a pinched private sector and soon-to-be-blitzed public realm, it feels as if a civic vacuum will soon open up – which brings us to a story that speaks volumes about the behemothic interests for whom hard times represent no end of opportunity. What might fill the void opened up by recession and austerity? Simple: a huge new supermarket, ringed by chain-store outlets, which will pull the town centre about a quarter of a mile east, where parking places will be plentiful and independent shops won't get a look-in. No matter that Frome already has six supermarkets, including hulking branches of Asda and Sainsbury's. A property developer, St James Investment Properties, has plans for another, which will chime with a shift in national planning policy whereby in-town supermarkets are held to be the future. They have a long record of working closely with Tesco, which seems a good indication of where Frome will end up. As Naomi Klein explained in the Shock Doctrine, nothing suits monopolistic capitalism like convulsive, crisis-ridden times. By way of an example think back to early 2009, and news that the few corporations promising expansion in a recession included Asda, Subway and KFC. Downturns crush independents: in their absence, the big players can lock down their dominance. ""Due to the economic slump, supermarket developments are likely to be the only regeneration available to British towns in the near future,"" said a Guardian report last month, citing fears expressed by the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment. The latter organisation's take on the supermarketisation of Britain is actually much more benign than some would like, but its recent report about ""supermarket-led development"" contains plenty of cautionary tales. In Halesworth, Suffolk, Tesco plonked a store on a ""sensitive"" local site and made no effort ""to create spaces or landscape in a way which would strengthen the sense of place""; in Bromley-by-Bow, a new development included housing, a school, and a park, but a ""monolithic"" Tesco got plum ""waterside frontage"" while new homes overlook the traffic-congested approach to Blackwall tunnel. This is the kind of nightmare many Frome locals fear: the dullest, most oppressive kind of arrival, thoroughly out of sync with a creative, imaginative local atmosphere. Put another way, it'll be another small step closer to the kind of future long since mapped out in middle America, in which banal convenience will conquer all – and this being Britain, forgetfulness will come at 24 cans for a tenner. ""You can't stop a development of this kind effectively,"" says Heath. ""What you've got to do is make it work for the town."" Come the revealing of the plans, plenty of voices will shout ""jobs, jobs, jobs"" – passing over their low-wage, no-prospects aspects – and the right people may roll over. Such are these hard times – and the answers apparently on offer whereby your town gets help from the kind of almighty interests that quietly end up strangling it. Were the nonconformists who built Frome's many chapels to return and be presented with this vision of the future, they might recognise the grim logic crystallised in Job 1:21: the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away.",A helping hand that threatens to strangle this small and brilliant place | John Harris,2010-12-01T07:30:01Z,John Harris,politics
"In a week marked by economic disaster, protests across the country, and the onward grind of the cuts agenda, it apparently falls to me to deliver some good news. No sniggering at the back, please: it involves that great cultural talisman Liam Gallagher, and his new group – or, rather, his old group minus his brother, and with a new, slightly crap name. If you haven't already heard, the quartet in question are called Beady Eye, and their first two songs are now in the public domain: a free-download A-side titled Bring The Light, and a supporting feature called Sons of the Stage, officially only available on a limited-edition 7-inch single, but now put up on YouTube, so everybody can have a listen. Despite myself, I like them both: whether accidentally or not, they seem to me to chime nicely with the abiding spirit of late 2010, but we'll come to that in a minute. As far as the first song is concerned, the revelation hit me last Friday, when I was on my way to the first day of filming for our new Guardian series Anywhere but Westminster. No matter that the Guardian had already previewed Bring the Light to a withering response: a freshly acquired copy of Bring the Light went on the car stereo, and had me and a colleague in fits of delirious laughter. Yes, it had distinct hints of the kind of rudimentary rock'n'roll one associates with, say, Status Quo. Of course, the lyrics were somewhat less than poetic (""I see no point, what you're thinkin'/I'm goin' out, I'm takin' you drinkin'""). But what the hell: with distinct echoes of the Rolling Stones' Let's Spend the Night Together, the refreshing absence of Oasis's old wall-of-sound guitars, and Liam's standard devil-may-care vocals, we were hooked. And that B-side! A quick history lesson, if you need it: Sons of the Stage was arguably the best song by a far-flung Mancunian band called World Of Twist, who brimmed with talent, but were crushed by the wheels of the record industry (their singer, Tony Ogden, died suddenly in 2006). The Beady Eye version is largely faithful to the original, but altogether nastier. It has one couplet in particular – ""Nothing you can do, cos there is no solution/Got to get down to the noise and confusion"" – perfectly suited to the younger Gallagher's belligerent mewl; and, just maybe, the current condition of the country. I mean that, I think. In times like these, it strikes me that the ideal role for rock music should be to both embody its time, and simultaneously offer some kind of respite from it. Looking to a 38-year-old multimillionaire with his own clothes range to do that may seem utterly absurd, but what if he – and Beady Eye – can deliver? These two songs hint at the Oasis aesthetic minus the tendency to sentimentality, and with their old menace back in the foreground, which could chime with such a grim, uncertain period; at the same time, the promise is of by-the-book abandon and dumb thrills, which might make people feel that bit better. Simple! So hats off, I say. One is reminded of a quote from Liam's estranged brother, with accidental echoes of those scenes in London yesterday: ""All the people the kids look up to now are bland, faceless trainee police officers ... Liam should be given a knighthood."" He shouldn't, but I hope you take the point.","Liam Gallagher's Beady Eye: the perfect soundtrack in a grim, uncertain nation? | John Harris",2010-11-25T15:08:21Z,John Harris,world
"Pickles will keep saying ""serviette"" and with Haguey it's still ""pleased to meet you"", and as for poor Govey, eating soup is literally climbing Everest for him, and Dave has been in utter despair because although those things shouldn't matter to him they just so do. Because of knowing people like Tricky I think I am kind of much more open-minded about being common, but I can totally see where he is coming from. So I said to Dave, let's just borrow someone from Marlborough for a term because, seriously, when I was there they could turn around a noov overnight, much quicker than Eton. Or maybe some random geek from St Andrews could teach them history of art, because of course it was the Fra Angelico Annunciation that finally stopped Kate Middleton saying toilet. So it was just a question of which housemaster until there was all the idiotic fuss about the photographer and so thank God for Downton Abbey or I never would have thought of Julian Fellowes. Who is way better than any old special adviser, Dave says, because we have got his manners completely free in exchange for a peerage, and it turns out he really can smell people who say pardon! Dave blindfolded him and he walked round the cabinet table and picked out Huhne as well as the Fartmeister, which is understandable, Julian says, because the Strathclyde barony is only from 1955. Everyone was doing so brilliantly that Julian said his wife had kindly agreed to come to us for drinks, even though she is hypersensitive about breeding and the Hagues were her great-great-uncle Lord Kitchener's serfs until, sadly, the great war. So Haguey did a perfect prostration and she said how priceless, wait until I tell my dear friend Princess Michael of Kent, and it was all so fun until she asked where we were going for Christmas and I said Phuket. Well thank goodness Danny carries an Epipen, because when she had come round Julian said it could quite easily have killed her, he felt pretty nauseous himself.

"Some elements of the white paper on education just sound a bit thick. I don't mind that. It is when the coalition sounds cunning that I dread it the most. Still, it bears pointing out that education secretary Michael Gove talks about a ""toxic target culture"" and then announces a stricter target: raising the threshold at which schools are considered to be ""failing"" to having fewer than 35% of pupils achieving five GCSEs graded A* to C. The current level is 30% – the change would bestow a failure tag on 439 schools (on 2009 figures). David Cameron spent most of the election vowing to free teachers who have to ""teach to the test"" only to launch a new test, this time for six-year-olds, to see if they can recognise words. Elsewhere the ideas sound a bit Littlejohn-lite: teachers will receive guidance on how to frisk students for drugs and porn, and how much force they're allowed to use; former troops will get special grants to retrain as teachers. I don't mind that idea at all, from the soldiers' point of view, but its announcement has nothing to do with army career progression. The aim is to foster the reassuring image of ne'er-do-wells whose porn has been confiscated then being yelled at by men with short hair. The white paper's suggestion that more teaching is done on the job, with less emphasis on teacher training colleges, has had an unenthusiastic response from teaching unions. They point out that students deserve qualified teachers and not trainees, and that not all of pedagogy can be covered by handy on-the-job tips – teachers need time to reflect, which they can't do in front of 30 students. Privately, there are teachers who take this as a political statement, since the colleges have traditionally been seen as hotbeds of leftwing radicalism. A survey by the communications offshoot of the Department for Schools, Children and Families found, however, that more teachers read the Daily Mail than the Guardian. So if teacher training colleges are academies for radicalism, they are doing a rubbish job. Sorry, I sound like an Ofsted inspector, which brings me to my main point. Ofsted metes out harsh judgments to schools and teachers. Its latest report – much of which is taken as the evidence base for this white paper – is more open than ever in its criticism. As usual it calls for bad teachers to be fired. This suggestion is regularly made and has a sly intent. Of course people who aren't doing their jobs properly should be fired – that's a given in other sectors (when have you ever heard a police chief say this about poorly performing coppers, or the BMA about GPs?). The inference is that the profession is littered with incompetents, and that, for years, nobody within it has had the courage or vision to get rid of them. The disdain Ofsted has for teachers is palpable, to the extent that it's quite refreshing to hear its chief, Christine Gilbert, state it plainly: ""The weakest area, and the area that I am most concerned about, is teaching. In many of our good schools we see pockets of weaker teaching."" Teaching unions can defend their members stoutly, and teachers of course can defend themselves: there's no shortage of people saying that if lessons look ""dull and uninspiring"" it's because the autonomy and creativity has been stripped out of the process by the latest set of targets, and the ones before that. But what unions don't do is criticise Ofsted back, so from a bystander's perspective the inspectorate retains its air of authority and impartiality. Ofsted are the experts. Whatever they say, why would they say it if it wasn't true? Privately, though, teachers are scathing about Ofsted. Dennis Charman, secondary teacher and secretary of the NUT in Hammersmith and Fulham, is very rare in saying this openly: ""I've taught for 36 years and my school is regarded as an outstanding school. I wouldn't allow an Ofsted inspector into my house. There is no respect for them in the profession. Why do people leave teaching to take on this work, on a daily contract basis? Generally it's because they can't hack it in the classroom. I would stand up in front of 1,000 teachers and say this, and they would all cheer."" Targets are set, standards are raised in sometimes eccentric directions, teachers are never consulted but are then made accountable to rules in which they've had no input. A school in Charman's borough recently contested an Ofsted ""unsatisfactory"" (they'd been expecting a ""good""). It turned out that the main reasons were a) they didn't have an electronic entry system on the gate, and b) they had a poor attendance record, because two children – here it all starts to sound a bit surreal – were involved in serious police investigations and had been placed, with their families, in safe houses. They were still enrolled, so although the inspector knew the circumstances they brought what was overall a good attendance average down to a bad one. This case isn't extraordinary, incidentally – it is only notable because the headteacher appealed the judgment. And that's extremely rare, since the punishment for appealing is another inspection. So a government appoints people who aren't teachers to set targets; those same people then attack schools for being too target-driven; and a new regime sets new targets to break the spell of the old targets. It would be more interesting, productive – and cheaper – to reform Ofsted, so that it drew its inspectors from among the best of the active teaching population. The ""target"" problem would probably solve itself.",Michael Gove's missed the obvious target for reform – Ofsted | Zoe Williams,2010-11-24T20:20:03Z,Zoe Williams,politics
"The Big Society is a place of many mansions and lord knows how many shacks, crescents, terraces, alleys and cul-de-sacs: a cluttered landscape of all kinds of charities and volunteer groups that we've learned to call ""social enterprises"". According to figures kept by the Social Enterprise Coalition, the United Kingdom has about 62,000 of them – more than any other country – and the government is presently trying to decide which of them is best suited to inherit the work of the public sector when the big cuts finally come. One that has already attracted prominent Tory commendation is an Edinburgh-based group called Working Rite and this week I went to see its co-founder, Sandy Campbell, who was down in London to talk to the civil servants whose job is to spread Working Rite's methodology much further than the few places, mainly in Scotland, that it has already reached. Working Rite's purpose looks simple enough: to introduce school-leavers to the world of work. Scores of other schemes and projects aim to do the same thing. What distinguishes Campbell's enterprise is its determination to separate teenage boys (there are few girls involved) from their peers and place them alone in an adult environment, with a boss. Mostly, it happens in the building trades with what Campbell calls ""white-van men"". Campbell will spot a white-van man, an independent contractor, say, refurbishing a housing estate, and ask him if he'd like to hire a helper for a £1 a hour. White-van man, if agreeable, then takes on a school-leaver for the next six months as a labourer and gofer. He pays him £35 a week, to which the state (in Scotland, the Skills Development agency) adds another £55 so that the boy's weekly wage is close to the £100 that a first-year apprentice would earn. In return, the boy does as he's told. He learns to make tea, to carry wood, to do some elementary painting, hammering and sawing, and he does all these things as best as he can because they aren't part of a classroom exercise. His boss has his eye on him. A botched job, after all, will cost the firm money. These are the basic mechanics, but underpinning them is a philosophy that sets Working Rite against one of the most dominant social trends of the western world: youth culture and the way it confines ""youngsters"" – Campbell isn't a fan of the word adolescent – to their peer group. Campbell blames it for ""the deadness at the heart of so many young men"" and wants to reinsert a clear transition – a rite of passage – to more responsible adulthood. His founding principle, therefore, is to separate teenagers from people of the same age – no others will work at the same site – so they spend their days trying to meet the challenges set by their elders. ""We're trying to spark a relationship with somebody outside their generation and their family who'll give them some idea of what it's like to be a man,"" Campbell said. ""We're saying to them, 'This will take time and respect for the older man, but you'll learn things. Your days as a child are over.' "" Campbell has drawn his ideas from many sources, including contentious students of the broken male state such as Robert Bly, while words such as ""respect"" and ""elders"" suggest an older moral framework that once held Campbell's Scotland (and mine) in a stiffer order. Like any good missionary, he can point to lessons learned in his own life as a tradesman's son (his father was a decorator and signwriter) who left school 40 years ago for a series of manual jobs that showed him the camaraderie and loyalty of men at work. Later he became a trade union activist and now, as a member of the thickening layer of social entrepreneurs, he carries a laptop. You could see him as the latest example of a British tradition that stretches back to the founders of the Scouts and the Boys' Brigade, anxious to re-moralise and re-dignify the working class; Campbell scolds teenage addictions to, among other things, X Factor celebrity and online pornography. But if any of these attitudes count as objections to Working Rite, there is also the more practical one that a boy might find himself under the thumb of a bully or a conman, that so much depends on a relationship going right and not wrong. In fact, the scheme has had remarkable results. About 800 teenagers have taken part over the past six years and, before the recession set in, three-quarters of those who completed the course went on to a fulltime job or apprenticeship (the figure now is between 50% and 60%). Campbell puts this down to the human skills of the tradesmen: ""It's been a huge, life-affirming lesson – how rarely I've come across a bad one."" Friendships have been formed across generations, tradesmen have even taught one or two boys how to read. The project encourages them with its slogan, ""Everyone remembers their first boss."" It wouldn't be true to say I remember too much about my own – a woman who showed me how to tidy the fiction shelves in the local library (spines to line up with shelf edge, books all erect and in alphabetical order by author's surname) – but my father, a tradesman who served his apprenticeship in a linen mill during the first world war, was still remembering his first foreman with vivid affection 60 years later: ""Good old Tam Davie – I took his collection when he retired and we went to the Co-op and bought him an easy chair in uncut moquette."" In that sense, Working Rite seems out of a different time and this, as Campbell says, may have been the reason the Tory party latched on to it. How couldn't they like a scheme that preaches respect for one's elders, is aimed at small businesses, and divides keen-to-learn sheep from feckless goats? Iain Duncan Smith praised it as an excellent example of how the third sector could provide ""innovative solutions to problems that have long defeated the state"" and at last year's conference the party promised that the model would be extended to 100,000 young people – a pledge repeated in government. The obstacles, however, are formidable and to be counted in more ways than binge-drinking, online porn and cheap cocaine. Working Rite runs counter to a still-popular ideology of full-time education continuing for more people, longer. In three or four years' time, unless the plans of the Labour government are undone, the school leaving age, or rather the age of mandatory educational participation, will rise to 18. Campbell calls this ""the time bomb left by Ed Balls"". Whatever one thinks of the big society, it's hard not to wish Campbell's organisation success. ""If we don't have a system that can transmit knowledge and skills from the past, from our elders, then our civilisation will die,"" he said. The idea that this is always better achieved by classroom study rather than by working with active practitioners – ""learning on the job"" – is one of the great mysteries of modern times.",You're hired: white van man and the real apprentices,2010-11-20T00:07:15Z,Ian Jack,society
"Such a nice-looking woman. The eyes sparkle reassuringly, the cheeks bloom wholesomely, the mouth smiles easily in an outgoing, friendly sort of way. The face does not have Diana's coy allure, but is commonsensically pretty. She clearly has the inner stability and strength for a future queen, not a ""people's princess"" but rather a potential icon of bourgeois monarchy. There you are. It is the best I can do. Another royal bride has launched a thousand platitudes on the rolling surf of celebrity. What can we poor commentators do? The nation apparently craves comment. Kate Middleton's face is more than a window on a soul, it is a window on the self-absorption of an entire people. It must stand proxy for biography, phrenology, psychology, gossip and sex. The face must tell all when so much is concealed. The one feature of the fiancee of a sometime king that they cannot censor or spin is her face. Age can wither it and custom stale its limited variety, but for the time being it is the one thing about her that is vulnerable and naked to the world. It is all we have to go on. Faces are in. Some commentators thought the last election was won and lost on a face – that of smooth, confident David Cameron against hassled, haggard Gordon Brown. According to the Guardian cartoonist Steve Bell, Cameron's face so embodies ""total moral opportunism combined with a complete, engorged, erectile sense of his own responsibility"" that he draws it cruelly inside a condom. It is hardly Cameron's fault that his skin is smooth. In contrast, Brown's face was caricatured as a decomposing Matterhorn of introvert exhaustion. His blind eye and muscular defect were mercilessly parodied. Ridicule is no respecter of the accidents of birth or injury. We no longer subject celebrities to trial by ordeal or combat. We leave them to cartoonists. Fair? Who said life was fair? It is Brown's fault he lost the election for not being beautiful. The taboo that personal comment should not harp on physical handicap or disadvantage is falsified by its converse: comment that harps relentlessly on beauty. We may wince at Orwell's remark that ""at 50 everyone has the face he deserves"", or Groucho Marx's quip: ""I never forget a face, but in your case I'll make an exception."" But the reality is that BBC women of a certain age do not survive high-definition television. The prose may be fine but the pores are a problem. Brains and brawn must work their way in the world, but beauty has a free pass. If a woman's face is her fortune, it should surely incur inheritance tax. In her biography of the Victorian admiral Jacky Fisher, Jan Morris tried to analyse the infatuation he induced in so many of his contemporaries. A humble-born, irreverent sailor with little experience of war, short and with a faintly oriental appearance, Fisher shot to the top of the most snobbish navy on earth. He dined privately with Queen Victoria and had politicians at his beck and call. He was master of all he commanded. What was so special about him? History offered Morris no clue until she came across an early photograph of the admiral's face. She became so obsessed with it that she pinned it up in that most intimate of privacies, her wardrobe. It was of a man childlike and puckish, with dark eyes and strangely alluring lips, curled into a permanent smile. Anyone in his company instinctively smiled in sympathy. Gregarious, garrulous, tactile, always dancing, the man was irresistible, and not just to women. He was a bundle of facial charm. The secret of his success, Morris concluded, lay in one thing, and she called her biography Fisher's Face. The pop psychology guru Malcolm Gladwell points out in his bestseller, Blink, that in virtually all contacts between individuals, the first visual glimpse is not just critical in conjuring a person to mind, it is all we get. The brevity may seem grotesque, but such facial flashes are the arbiters of most human relationships other than the closest. They are love or hate at first sight. On such flint-sparks we do what we can to form an impression. The truth is that we accord appearance far more importance than we dare admit. We carry battered pictures of ourselves on cards and in wallets, as if they held our true identity. Young people exchange faces by internet as a simulacrum for friendship. This article is accompanied by a snapshot of its author, who cringes at its unrecognisability. He may plead for its removal – claiming pompously that it erects a wall of false impression between words and reader – but the editor is implacable. Words can no longer stand on their own feet. The reader apparently requires that the writer pose before a camera, as if he were an illegal immigrant in the empire of prose. Something is needed to add colour to grey print, warmth to cold text, humanity to brute opinion. Some newspapers even prop up writers' faces with an entire suit of clothes, as if a column were window dressing a manikin. My first humble job in journalism was to edit the apotheosis of the English face, the Country Life frontispiece. In those days it was a proper portrait, usually of a sub-lieutenant's fiancee, identical in hair, pearls and cashmere, with only the face to convey distinction. Over the years the feature became an anthropological record of a class of English female face, the sort described by Oscar Wilde as ""once seen, never remembered"". I longed one day to do a spoof frontispiece of Lucy, the hominid fossil found in Kenya, in full Bond Street rig, to see if readers noticed. That frontispiece has, like these words, lost its presentational purity. Even a face dare not stand on it own. The Country Life girl is no longer a head wholly filling the frame but is surrounded by the clutter of middle-class status – by clothes, dogs, flowerbeds, interior design and, increasingly, something the girl is trying to sell, such as herself. The point used to be that the girl was engaged, unattainable, already sold. The frontispiece is now a record of lifestyle, while students of the human face would do better to study diamond advertisements. The drug pushers of this craze, the photographers, are ever more facially intrusive, their lenses so powerful they can penetrate every pore and reveal the tiniest wrinkle or shaving mishap. Layout artists crop faces so as to exaggerate ageing or pass some quasi-political comment. I remember a BBC cameraman once asking his director before an interview: ""Are we lighting for or against?"" Those who deride popular analysts of the Middleton face should beware. They do it themselves all the time. We all try to read between the lines. We long to leap the fence of privacy, to know better the person on the other side and ""find the mind's construction in the face"".

"So, clearly, it is a very big deal that Prince William is marrying a commoner. The Daily Mail thinks it is a ""huge step towards rekindling the love affair between crown and country"". And yes, the tabloids have started calling him ""Wills"", in that over-familiar, quasi-maternal, lickspittle nostalgia for a time when we loved them so much that a Henry would automatically be a Hal. This nicknaming is sort of ironic (conveying ownership, when in fact, at the very most we rent him), and playfully paradoxical (seeming to be chummy, but in fact betokening our humblest respect), but mainly it just makes me want to be sick. Sorry, not him, just his nickname! He's getting married, and I couldn't be happier. It's a stamp of royal approval for the middle class. Alice Thomson in The Times called it a ""Boden breakthrough"" – a beautifully crafted insult, since to the Boden classes it is excitingly bitchy, yet Middleton is slightly too young to know what it means. Love, it means zingy polka dots you're too old for, in shapes frumpy enough that you just about get away with. Let's define our terms: royal, we all comprehend. ""Commoner"" is anybody who holds no title of nobility, so this is probably the least snobbish word to be applied to Middleton since it doesn't even spell out that she's not an aristocrat. She's solidly middle class – curving upwards in her education (she went to Marlborough), and downwards in her family (her grandfather drove lorries, her mother was once an air hostess). There were rumours, when they split up, that unkind friends of the prince used to call Middleton ""doors-to-manual"", referring to her mother's former job. It's funny, isn't it, snobbery? You think it'll have some caustic power, then you see it in finer detail and it's witless. But of course, this could all be rumour. If anybody did say anything out loud, then it would definitely be untrue, since the defining feature of establishment displeasure is that it is never spoken. They deal with interlopers using the silent threat of a humiliation to keep their brand undiluted. Nobody's talking about the dilution of our brand. Nobody's saying, where will the middle classes go from here? That's because our brand is rubbish. There's a fiction among the middle classes that class no longer exists. There's a fiction among the upper classes that it does exist, but it's all ""separate but equal""; we're essentially the same, but our funny little ways are different. It's all dross: the class system is intact – the people at the top think they are the best, the people at the bottom think they're the worst. So while everybody raises high the roof beams to love's young dream, this wedding deals a great blow to the royal family, so great that one wonders why they've let it happen. I think it's for the sake of the gene pool – they've lived with the consequences of their open-door policy on neurotics. It would be foolish to turn away a sane (or, as Wills has it, ""down-to-earth"") one. Social advancement is a zero sum game, though – it has to be, otherwise we'd all have got to the top by now, we've had centuries. If the middle classes have won, then the aristocracy has lost. For more than 100 years it has been thought reasonable for a posho on hard times to marry a middle class person whose family is doing well, but royals … royals are like penguins; a fleck of oil the size of a penny destroys their waterproof seal and they freeze to death. Kate Middleton might look like just a fleck, a petite size eight of arriviste, but that'll do it. The furnace of William's divine right has been put out, because the rights of kings and princes no longer come from God. They come from a different kind of faith, a dogged conviction that breeding matters. When even the thoroughbred at the top doesn't buy it, maybe the structure won't collapse immediately, but its internal architecture starts to look a little bit experimental (nobody tell Prince Charles). This is brilliant: this is as socially reforming as any British prince has ever been (without abdicating). And it demonstrates two great boons of the modern condition. First, it shows the power of a young person's sex drive to overcome all kinds of nonsense. I'm not speculating on the current state of William and Kate's sex life. They've been together for ages. Probably they just do it once a week, after The X Factor, like everybody else. But in 2001, when they met, that's what would have driven the revolutionary zeal of the young prince; ""never mind that one day I will be king"" (perhaps) ""and her family just makes hats"" (or do they sell hats? Wear hats wrongly? Something like that …) – ""isn't she pretty!"" Second, university was, in this as in so many other cases, the crucible of social change. Nobody really wants to be locked into their own class. A lot of people would give up centuries of entrenched privilege just for a bit of fresh air. But further education is the most, possibly the only, flexible space of a person's life. Schools are segregated rather strictly, and by the time your education is over, your circle is made. It just remains to be said: republicans, will you stop going on about how much this wedding will cost? It's a nail in the coffin of an obnoxious hierarchy. Are you really going to carp about lending them your hammer?","With his engagement to Kate Middleton, the furnace of Prince William's divine right has been put out | Zoe Williams",2010-11-18T08:30:01Z,Zoe Williams,uk
"     It was an aristocratic novelist who gave us Love in a Cold Climate. Now the royal family are to host a Wedding in the Age of Austerity. The delight on David Cameron's brightly lit face as he delivered his congratulations to Prince William and Kate Middleton via the press pack outside No 10 today was mainly that of a decent chap glad to celebrate a young couple in love. It might have also included a shot of country set solidarity with Kate, who apparently grew up in a village just a few miles away from his own in west Berkshire and is every bit as Home Counties as he is. But he would be forgiven if his smile were also that of a politician relieved to be the bearer – for once – of good news, having calculated that a royal wedding would act as handy distraction from the economic gloom and spending cuts that are due to bite in the early months of 2011. He may even see an uptick in his just-launched national happiness index. At first, media types were trading just such cynical thoughts. But they were soon swept aside as the 24-hour broadcasters went into full hysteria mode, the BBC dispatching a helicopter to provide an unchanging aerial shot of Buckingham Palace and pressing its most senior diplomatic and political correspondents to discuss the upcoming nuptials. It's easy to knock all that as an over-reaction, but the truth about Britain is that such moments – royal births, deaths and marriages – do have a habit of revealing what kind of country we are. The joining of the girl he calls ""Babykins"" and the boy she knows as ""Big Willie"" will be no exception. First, we got a glimpse of how others see us. ABC's Good Morning America opened with a trumpeted fanfare over pictures of the couple, proof that in the US Britain remains more period drama than real country, a Ruritanian theme park that is forever charming and quaint. Here, we got a reminder that the UK media remains as fixated on the royals as ever. The photocall and TV interview will inaugurate an unending press obsession, with Middleton's face surely bound for the cover of Hello! and OK! every week from now until the wedding and for years afterwards. The flashbulb lightning that greeted their photo-op anoints her, if only in terms of media interest, as the new Diana. The day too showed how many British habits have endured. Sexism lives on: the engagement was entirely reported as his, rather than their, decision. The speculation on the dress confirmed that in matters royal, the grammar of the fairytale still applies. Class matters too. The BBC described Middleton without irony as a ""commoner"", while we're told Palace hangers-on mocked her self-made parents as vulgarly middle class (as millionaires, they are, economically at least, way outside the middle-class mainstream). Some felt a royal wedding amid recession, riots and strikes was all a bit 1981, as if the Windsors were taking us on a Life on Mars trip back three decades. Seeing Prince Charles still awkward and constipated in his reaction to an emotional question – irritably spitting out that he was ""obviously thrilled"" to a reporter's inquiry, then carrying on with a meet-and-greet – suggested we had indeed taken a step back in time. But the differences between then and now were also apparent. Kate and William lived together as students, a fact that raised fewer eyebrows than it would have done in 1981. In the joint TV interview, William joked that he and his bride share a ""dirty sense of humour"". One can't have imagined Charles speaking that way and as for the Queen, well. When the future king talked of how he and Kate used to ""hang out"" together, it was a sign that times had changed. But there is another shift too. Having seen the fate of three out of the four recent Windsor marriages, few will expect, as they once did, that this story will automatically have a happy ending. But the couple did look at genuine ease with each other and have had plenty of time together, which Charles and Diana never did. Even the most hardbitten republican will be wishing them well.",Prince William and Kate Middleton: a royal wedding in the age of austerity | Jonathan Freedland,2010-11-16T22:22:55Z,Jonathan Freedland,uk
"The worst thing a batsman once feared was a crack on the head from a bouncer. Now he must cope with a call in the night, an offer of money to throw a match, a threat to his career if he refuses, and a final ""We know where your children live"". The Pakistani wicket keeper, Zulqarnain Haider, has felt obliged to escape his Dubai hotel and seek political asylum in London, showing how far money has polluted his sport. Haider told the press on Wednesday that he is far from being the only player under such pressure. As last summer's spot-fixing scandal showed, all is not well on either side of the wicket. I recall watching televised all-in wrestling (briefly) in the company of a distinguished sports journalist, and commenting on the absurdity of its theatricals. They were clearly fixed. I was met with roars of laughter: ""All sport is fixed, in some sense or another."" Just as money talked when sport was amateur, so money talks now. In the case of the big money games, such as football, cycling, boxing and cricket, a potent mix of gambling, drugs, media profit and chauvinist politics oils the wheels of play and rolls them into murky places. The BBC last week received a deputation from frantic football officials who had been bidden by David Cameron to ""win"" the World Cup for Britain in 2018. The corporation is planning to run a Panorama exposé on corruption in football's international governing body, Fifa, on 29 November, just as its 24 members prepare to vote on Britain's bid. The BBC allegations are believed to be the same as those revealed last month in the Sunday Times. It is alleged that two members of Fifa were prepared to accept bribes and the footage allegedly shows a Fifa official boasting of his ability to buy votes on which should be the next host country. The accusations are hardly new to students of Fifa and its indestructible boss, Sepp Blatter. But the BBC programme is being aired four days before Blatter's colleagues vote on who gets the cup in 2018 and 2022. The British officials are probably right that the prospect of Fifa coming under sustained scrutiny from the British press will harm their cause. Indeed, they plausibly suggest it may kill the bid stone-dead. Why the BBC agreed to even meet the officials is a mystery. Their demand that the programme be postponed until after the Fifa vote was outrageous, like al-Qaida calling for a bomb threat to be suppressed until the explosive has gone off. Newspapers should never conspire to conceal a scandal to suit the political interests of governments or the dubious financial interests of sports officials. The BBC rightly sent Fifa's lackeys packing. Britain should have no truck with a body like Fifa, any more than it should with the International Olympic Committee or those who run much of international sport. Five minutes spent with the cuttings, or trawling such websites as playthegame and transparencyinsport, should have stopped Cameron being photographed shaking hands with Blatter at Downing Street. His staff should have read Andrew Jennings' Foul! on Blatter, and thrown in Christopher Shaw's Five Ring Circus, about the IOC, for good measure. Incident after incident, case after case, has shown these self-governing supranational apparatus riddled with accusations of backhanders, bribes and fixed votes – often quite legal in the countries where they carefully base themselves, such as Switzerland and Liechtenstein. Their officials jet the world, pushing the one narcotic to which all modern governments are addicted – sporting glory. For decades the IOC turned a blind eye to the communist bloc's use of drugs to boost performance, or China's (and Tony Blair's) exploitation of the Olympics for political ends. It now demands inexcusable outlays of taxpayers' money to stage its two-week festival of minority sports. When the IOC demands an exclusive ""Zil lane"" for its official cars up London's Mile End Road, the British government meekly obeys. It would not offer this to a head of state. Likewise Fifa turns a blind eye to longstanding charges of vote rigging. Its laughable ethics committee deplored last month's revelations as ""unethical"" and ""rumours"", though it was forced to suspend six of the alleged ""vote fixers"" named in the paper. Fifa's Blatter has contrived to keep his job for 36 years, by means that would do credit to a Muammar Gaddafi. He professes ""surprise"" at talk of bribes while banning journalists like Jennings who ask questions about them from his press conferences. It is hard to know how deep-seated sports corruption is because the dirt is coated in glamour. Practices that in any other industry would cause an outcry are swept under the carpet in sport. We hear of drugged cyclists, thrown boxing fights, suborned soccer goalies, fake rugby blood, dropped cricket catches, but they blow over. It is amazing that Italian football teams, notorious for referee-nobbling, are still allowed to play internationally. What is no less extraordinary is the inertia of international bodies supposedly set up to regulate sport. Like other supranational institutions such as the European Union and the UN's agencies, they handle large sums of other people's money without oversight or democratic audit, surrounded by reports of corruption on which they appear to take no proper action. Qatar has reportedly offered $43bn if Fifa will only give it the 2022 World Cup – or rather if the vote-fixers can cut a deal with a rival Iberian bid. The failings of domestic governments are bad enough, but at least they can be voted from office. Budgets can be cut and staff sacked. Nothing like this happens to supranational bodies. Reliant on the acquiescence of member states, they seem to be able to do what they like and get away with it. Orwell remarked that sport was nothing to do with fair play, but was ""bound up with hatred, jealousy, boastfulness, disregard of all rules and sadistic pleasure in witnessing violence"". And that was in the days of amateurism. Today the national and international bodies that rule sport are, as the IOC's former boss, Avery Brundage, once boasted, the new church. They preside over a conservative fanaticism, that is sport, with the indulgence of a 15th-century papacy, in unholy alliance with kings, dictators, bankers and media condottieri. As long as people are besotted by games, and governments are dazzled by their glamour, cricketers will be bribed and football officials corrupted. Nothing will change. The pharmacists will always be one step ahead of the drug testers. The numbered accounts of Zurich and Geneva will always be one step ahead of the auditors. If this is a medieval church, it need fear no Luther. Except perhaps one. International sporting bodies do have a critic they fear, a true enemy, the profession of investigative journalism. Sometimes we should thank heaven for it. No one else is doing its job. Roll on, Sunday Times, roll on, Panorama.

"It was sooooo predictable but still the tiniest bit upsetting, tbh, that everyone would freak about the new global fashion envoys because as soon as everyone sees the effect on the trade figures I know they will feel so blessed to have Dave and the boys working their socks off for luxury classics. But it's quite boring being in the middle with Tamara going nuts about their hideous suits and shoes in China and saying she feels so let down because they are literally the ugliest people she has ever met, she knows cats who would be better fashion ambassadors, and do I realise that Michael Gove alone has probably set her brand back by around 15 years which is how long it took to make Jimmy Choos look edgy and sexy instead of just insanely vulgar and expensive. Well that is quite unkind because no one could have worked harder on his image than Govey before his China trip, look at his hair, simple but chic, and even Vince agreed to get his brows done. So once she'd calmed down I said Tamara you have to remember they are totally new to leather goods and just doing their best and it's so unfair to rake up all their old publicity photographs – how were they to know they would end up working for Jimmy Choo? And I went frankly, I do not think a person who has customised Uggs is in a position to criticise anyone, so she hung up.

"There's to be a national student demo through London on Wednesday about fees and cuts. Finally. Hallelujah. I've been wondering why they weren't rioting, sitting in, getting all ""Vietnam"" and direct action about it – nothing violent, some gentle eggings perhaps. Students are traditionally in the vanguard of protest, the heartbeat of righteous fury, so recently you couldn't help but wonder: where are they, where's their fire gone? Now something is happening and not before time. Broadening debates is very wise. However, I'm not sure I agree with the persistent, well-meaning attempts to put tuition fees ""into context"" with other devastating cuts. Isn't there a risk that too much ""putting things into perspective"" plays into the coalition's hands, effectively running their smear campaign against students for them? Basically it's saying: ""Look at this much needier, much poorer person, and how they're going to suffer. Now look at this privileged student – yes, facing a huge hike in fees and cut in services, but also young, healthy, flying high, getting a university education and better prospects for life. Harrumph! I know who I feel sorry for."" What's this – the top trumps of compartmentalised empathy? ""I did feel sorry for students, they were one of my best cards, but now I see this other group has got more Suffering & Hardship points, so they win."" Just possibly we're elastic enough to feel sympathy for other victims of cuts, while appreciating that students have been given a raw deal. And a raw deal it is. Will the increased fees scare off poorer candidates? Duh. I definitely wouldn't have bothered in these circumstances and frankly I would have been no great loss. However, this doesn't mean other more deserving people aren't going to miss out unjustly. It doesn't even make sense that the payback starts when students are earning around the average wage. Isn't the whole point that graduates earn significantly higher than ordinary mortals? The payback point should reflect this (£40-50K?). Otherwise, graduates are effectively being penalised for earning an average wage, which, being average, non-graduates would presumably earn without getting into debt. A major problem here is that the coalition leaders are rich, with small children. They do not comprehend the paralysing terror of a sum such as £9,000 (and the rest). How the psychological effect of incurring such debt could be like twine around the ankle, tugging personal ambition down into the deep. At the same time, they have zero insight into ""launching"" teenagers. Getting into university is complex, exhausting and expensive – travelling, train fares, endless form filling, Ucas statements. It's bad enough for the oft-mocked, ""sharp-elbowed"" middle classes. Without strong parental back-up, it's a miracle any of the poorer, less-supported kids navigate their way through what amounts to a chattering-class firewall and secure a place. They would already have shown immense character and fortitude – only to get kicked in the teeth at the end. This is the point. Don't fall for the coalition smear campaign: students are not an elite no one should feel sorry for. But this legislation could make them so. After all, the people who always went to university will still go to university. It is the others, for whom university was never a given, who will end up missing out, creating a them-and-us forcefield around higher educational opportunity that will scupper generations. This much is obvious and surely worth anyone's disgust and focus next Wednesday. So yes, I've been questioning the apparently feeble student response, wondering if any sense of brio and protest had been bred out of the wusses. Now here is a march, one hopes a big, juicy, righteous march. Spiritually, if not, physically, we should be walking every step of the way with them. Jon Snow's stern stance comes rather too close to poppycock The Jon Snow ""poppy fascism""/""I'm not wearing one on TV"" furore has become something of an annual event. Snow is right that it's a question of choice; poppy-bullying misses the point of hard-won liberty and his being ""on the telly"" is irrelevant. Then again, does he have to be quite so stiff? Personally, I'm all for poppies; I find them and everything about Remembrance Sunday special and poignant. Perhaps because a grandfather I never met was at Dunkirk, but also… just because. Poppies strike a similar inexplicable yet evocative chord in a wide variety of people – they make the unpatriotic feel patriotic and lots of people, including pacifists, seem to appreciate the opportunity to honour the fallen, of all sides, of all wars. Against this backdrop, Snow looks inflexible, to say the least. One sympathises with his predicament (how can he start wearing one on TV now?), but one day he might realise that he was the one who grabbed the paintbrush and painted himself into this particular corner. Kate, you've shot yourself in the foot How pathetic of Kate Middleton and her parents to attend a deer-shooting party at Balmoral, supposedly to prove that they could fit in with the royal family and should be forgiven for the heinous crime of being middle class. Coming from Rutland, once a noted fox-hunting area, I feel entitled to say this – it's repulsive and absurd that so much of this nation's beautiful countryside should be given over to human tragedies in tweed wanting to kill things. Or, more likely these days, City dealers on a bonding weekend. However, it's even worse if you've been pressured into it. With this craven kowtowing to the Windsors, the Middletons have lost all public respect. They are so self-hating and ridiculous that the only way forward is to have Julian Fellowes turn them into characters for Downton Abbey, which I've been enjoying immensely for its strangely pitched insights into a bygone, class-bound era (think the Mitfords via Bob Crow). Downton Abbey already has middle-class characters, but they're too noble and dashing for purpose – Fellowes should hurl some grisly, upstart Middletons into the mix. In the meantime, Carole Middleton should stop making a To the Manor Born fool of herself – sprawling around, in her quilted waistcoat, posing with guns. Lest she and her daughter forget, as a young bride, Diana Spencer, for all her airheaded sins, adamantly refused to take part in any blood sports. Admittedly, all she did was sit at home listening to Duran Duran and developing a food disorder, but at least she had the courage of her convictions. Maybe it really is all a matter of breeding.

"After a long struggle, the Booth-Blairs are reportedly close to winning approval for new leisure facilities at one of their houses, the enchanting, listed South Pavilion in Buckinghamshire, built around 1704. Lancelot ""Capability"" Brown having died before the all-weather tennis courts, sauna, outdoor kitchenette and training pool could be completed at this property, the new owners now wish to complete the work begun by the talented landscape gardener and his collaborator, Sir John Soane, with what is described in a recently submitted ""justifying statement"" as ""an unashamedly contemporary structure which, in accordance with good conservation philosophy and practice will form a clear (but complementary) contrast to the historic wall it abuts"". This new Blair pavilion, one that is making Premier League footballers faint with envy, will also, in accordance with Cherie philosophy, be visible from South Pavilion and, more important, from neighbouring Wotton House, to which their own house was once an annexe, thus gifting to future generations a set of views which had hitherto registered a complete absence of any zinc and glass sporting lean-tos. ""The building will not, however, be prominent in these views,"" says the family architect, who has removed a set of solar panels present in the original design, ""nor have any significant impact on them, being seen simply as a clean and minor intervention in a much wider view."" He adds that the ""well-designed roof of the pavilion will at least partly obscure the existing view of the recently approved tennis court and its fenced enclosure"". Some time in the future, perhaps a new, well-designed warehouse or light industrial unit, clean and minor in appearance, could in turn obscure the roof of the new changing facilities, and so on, until the Blairs' tennis court and its wire fence cannot be seen from the big house at all. Once the garden has been trashed, it remains only to ornament the property with quaint eastern daggers (a Downing Street bonus), a ""Beware of the Hen Poo"" sign, a pair of silver salt and pepper pots in the shape of owls, a new portrait featuring Mrs Blair as Eleanor of Aquitaine, and the many other eBay finds which have recently confirmed, to Blairphobic aesthetes, that taste as dreadful as this has to tell you something about a person. Or as Peter York, the taste professional and author of Dictators' Homes: Lifestyles of the World's Most Colourful Despots, has put it: ""It's stretching a point to say 'wicked people equal horrible decorations' but, in most cases, it holds true."" Although the Blairs never came close, not that they had the opportunity, to committing the upholstery crimes of a Saddam Hussein, their frowsy London interiors, furiously draped, chandeliered, patterned and cluttered, seemed to hint at something stranger than decorative idiosyncrasy. Did the Blairs never open their eyes and wonder why, seemingly alone among bien pensants, they were living in an upmarket retirement home? It is not as if they were on a budget. Were they too busy with power? Was it social insecurity? Or could it be a New Labour thing? Alastair Campbell, after all, displays a bronze effigy of his spaniel. David Miliband was recently photographed beneath a large, splashy, apparently non-ironic painting of 13 dancing nudes, a present from Louise to David. ""Is this what a leader of the opposition manque should have on his wall?"" demanded Stephen Bayley, another authority on design. A questionable cushion and Miliband's ""difficult"" floral shirt also had to be taken into consideration. ""We are continuously at risk of being denounced by our possessions,"" Bayley wrote, ""and here is a denunciation as thorough in its way as the NKVD-sponsored show trials of the 50s. Unwittingly, Mrs Miliband's generous birthday present has confirmed suspicions about her husband's taste and tolerance first raised by his banana."" It follows, presumably, that where a leader of the opposition can demonstrate acceptable or meritorious taste, this should promote confidence in his personality. To judge by David Cameron's experience, it can certainly make up for banana-sized doubts. Back when the prime minister was still failing to impress, it was agreed that his light, minimalist family home possessed definite appeal and was in fact so very chic and desirable that readers were invited to examine the interiors as if they were a feature in Elle Deco and get the ""big society"" look. The lights were from Habitat, the stove Franco Belge, the blender Cuisinart, the bin Brabantia. That lifestyle empathy might translate into votes was a principle with his promoters: an Andrew Marr interview filled out Webcameron's through-the-keyhole glimpses of shining floors, eye-level wine storage, Sebastian Faulks-stocked bookshelves. Weekends were a feast of Boden. In Cameron on Cameron, published in 2008, another style professional, Dylan Jones, thought it worth itemising, in the constituency kitchen, a Dualit toaster, Maytag fridge-freezer, Bodum cafetiere, a Daily Mail ""bathed in sunlight"" and Jamie Oliver cookery books. After his election, an extensive Downing Street refurb which could easily have looked princessy was interpreted, instead, as yet more evidence of devout, William Morris restraint: have nothing in your house that you do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful. So, assuming Mrs Cameron's creation of Smythson bags and notebooks can be left out of the equation, there was nothing in the Cameron aesthetic to hint that he might not be a paragon. No sprawling, naked ladies. No musty flounces. No ""den"". No sign saying: ""Beware of the Hen Poo"". What has followed is enough to shake, forever, one's faith in possessions as a measure of virtue. Could it even mean that David Miliband is not, despite the recent evidence of his artwork, fundamentally unsound? For not one single, hideous cushion indicated that, just a few months into his tenure, Cameron would succumb to the same cravings as the vainest, tinpottiest dictator with a corrupted taste in soft furnishings. Rather, his Dualit toaster had affirmed that here was someone who would never arrange for his personal photographer and film-maker to be put on the public payroll, the better to disseminate only approved images of his dashing, patriotic mug. Is he planning to take his top off, nuzzle horses and hold guns, like Prime Minister Putin? Or wear different hats, like Saddam? More likely, it will be more of what worked: pictures of beaches, babies and a pint of your finest, mine host. In an ideal world, no newspaper would be abject enough to use them. Of course, Blair, who is the more obviously vain, had his own flirtations with this species of vulgarity; witness those grainy shots of him plotting war in various cosy nooks. Much good it did him. Presumably some spin-person's calculation has established that public distaste for Cameron's monumental conceit will be outweighed, long-term, by admiration for his lifestyle, as detailed in the forthcoming propaganda. It seems a bit risky. We have yet to see Ed Miliband's bin.",What's in worse taste – Cameron's photographer or Blair's house? | Catherine Bennett,2010-11-07T00:07:05Z,Catherine Bennett,politics
"According to records kept by the German and Polish state railways, about 1,600 trains delivered about eight million people to the death camps of Nazi-occupied Europe. Road transport could never have handled such multitudes. Hitler, nevertheless, wasn't a railway enthusiast; railways were too old a technology for the Nazi party to celebrate wholeheartedly, even though for a time in the 1930s that sprightly train, the Flying Hamburger, held the world speed record. Instead – and this may come as a comfort to train lovers (the kind of comfort not afforded to Wagnerites and vegetarians) – Hitler preferred the modernity of Volkswagens, Panzers and autobahns. He was, in other words, just as much of a petrol-head as Jeremy Clarkson, and this, by Christian Wolmar's interesting argument, was a factor in his undoing. The key moment came with Operation Barbarossa, his three-pronged invasion of the Soviet Union. Blitzkrieg, hitting the enemy swiftly with aircraft and tanks, had worked well in Poland and France. In the Soviet Union, however, the distances were far greater and the quick knock-out blow elusive. Leningrad and Moscow held out. Autumn and winter turned unpaved roads into mush. An invading force of three million – the largest assembled in history – was soon stuck far from its bases and vital supplies. Logistically, what Hitler needed for a long campaign were railways; but Germany's railways were unprepared. They had no more rolling stock than in 1914, and their locomotives were often too delicate mechanically to cope with the fierce Russian winter. Worse, the German and Soviet systems had tracks of different widths: the first used the standard gauge that Britain had popularised, while the second (a tsarist bequest) was 3.5in wider. A change of gauge always altered the balance of war in favour of the defender because it complicated an invader's supply lines. The Germans had learned the lesson on the Russian front in the first world war and to some extent prepared accordingly. Motorised units would crash ahead for 300 miles, and then halt while railway engineers worked furiously to narrow the track to the new forward position. That was the plan, but it fell apart in the face of chaotic reality. Tracks and trucks could be re-gauged, but not locomotives. The Germans had hoped to use Soviet engines, but the Soviets sensibly withdrew the best of them as their army fell back. The Wehrmacht was certainly a more determined outfit than Network Rail; even so, it never overcame the gauge problem. Supplies piled up at junctions and trans-shipment points far from the front. To have any chance of success, the German assault on Moscow needed 30 supply trains a day, but Field Marshal von Bock's army never got more than 18. The railways behind the Soviet lines, by contrast, performed remarkably well. The trains ran across familiar home soil, which railway workers were desperate to defend, and at the ruthless command of Stalin's regime. Trains braved aerial bombardment to move vital industries towards the safety of the east, while over the course of the war labourers laid 4,500 miles of new track, including a stretch intended to serve the defenders of Stalingrad. A year or two earlier, Hitler's lovely roads had been emptied by the acute shortage of petrol; his Soviet conquerors had plenty of coal to raise steam. It would be hard to argue that railways won this or any other war, but as Wolmar's book demonstrates, often entertainingly, they were an essential component of warfare for almost a century. The British built the world's first purely military line in 1855, the so-called Grand Crimean Central, to run uphill from the port at Balaclava to the troops who were besieging Sebastopol. It was clumsy and awkward; over the course of only a few miles it used a mixture of steam locomotion, winding engines, gravity and horses to haul munitions trucks to the guns. Its effect, though, was stunning – literally so among the Russian defenders of Sebastopol, who endured spectacularly heavy bombardments (150,000 rounds in four days). On their return journey, now empty of high explosives, the trucks carried the sick and the wounded, in greater numbers and more comfortably than in carts or on half-starved horses. The Crimea prefigured the wars to come. As Wolmar says, trains enabled some of the bloodiest conflicts in history, delivering huge quantities of troops, munitions and rations to the front line, moving them between fronts, packing bleeding casualties into coaches lined with straw (and, eventually, beds). The American civil, the Franco-Prussian, the Boer, the Russo-Japanese: coal smoke blew across the barracks and supply dumps of all these wars as locomotives waited to fetch men to the battlefield. Sometimes it blew across the battlefield itself – before tanks arrived, there was a vogue for armoured trains (the Boers captured the young Churchill on one of them). But there were no railway equivalents of the great naval battles, and military strategists saw trains mainly as their great logistical tool. Without them, the western front from 1914 to 1918 would have been an altogether different place, if it had existed at all. Hard-working railways kept both sides so well supplied that decisive breakthroughs were impossible. The opposing armies settled into trenches that were fed by narrow-gauge lines newly laid across the mud. Both sides had them, spreading like capillaries across the map of Flanders, fetching shells, bandages and tins of jam from the major railheads that were beyond the range of an artillery barrage. The little lines themselves were frequently shelled, and re-laid with amazing speed. Wolmar writes well about all this. Reading his account, an inappropriately comic image came to mind from the film The Wrong Trousers, starring Wallace and Gromit. The dog is perched on the front of a fast-moving toy train, laying track before him just in the nick of time. The viewer has to deal with a marvellous kind of riddle, track and train rather than chicken and egg. Would there have been wars without railways? Yes – but they would not have been the same kind of wars.  Ian Jack's The Country Formerly Known as Great Britain is published by Vintage.

"It's weird but until last weekend I had never properly met any Germans besides Karl Lagerfeld, and Dave said I should put him totally out of my mind, because Lagerfeld has practically gone French and the whole point of sucking up to the Merkels is to make the Huns like us more than the Frogs. Anyway thank God for Isabel, whatever the papers say, because if she wasn't on the staff, being paid a complete pittance, I'd so like to know who would have let us into an amazing diplomatic secret – Germans adore sausages! Who knew? So Perkins ordered lots of the slimy tinned ones which are their fave kind, Isabel says, and we ran the Chequers menu past Heidi Klum, who is basically the world's most powerful German, Isabel says, and she was like don't forget the sauerkraut, plus mustard – not the seedy French kind, and we positively must not mention the war which was a bit doh, who do you think I am, Harriet Harman, since it happened way before I was born. Worrying moment when I was getting dressed and thought OMG poppies! – equals the war, equals verboten. But Isabel who never forgets accessories and receives absolutely no credit, so unfair, had already got one of those new Swarovski ones which could be remembering the war dead but could just as easily be a bespoke evening corsage. So, after Nicky filmed Andy snapping us all sharing a joke we went through for sausages and the Merkels looked amazed probably because no English person has ever made an effort with Germans like that, or not since the Mitfords who Angela hadn't met, such an incredible family except for the sad fascism. Dinner was quite sticky, actually, even with Isabel's list of German conversational topics, because the so-called Wagner fan Dr Sauer had never heard of Simon Cowell and there is only so much you can say about Birkenstocks. Plus they were both obsessed with the Midsomer Murders which was not very nice because, like Isabel says, who wants to chat about hideous terrorist atrocities over the Black Forest gateau? But not to worry because what matters is the pictures which Dave says are totally iconic, job done, and Isabel agrees.",Mrs Cameron's Diary,2010-11-03T21:00:00Z,Catherine Bennett,politics
"Call it a triumph of expectations management, but there will be some Democrats waking this morning to a slight sense of relief. At least, they will say, we didn't lose the Senate and, though we were defeated in the House of Representatives, it wasn't the full 70-seat blowout a few of us had feared. Besides, there are some quite chunky crumbs of comfort: the big states of New York and California are now back under Democratic gubernatorial management (""back"" being the right word in California, where Jerry Brown has set an inspiring precedent for London's past and would-be future mayor, Ken Livingstone, reclaiming long past retirement age a job he first held more than 30 years ago). But crumbs of comfort are what they are. This was a terrible night for the Democratic party, losing even more seats in the house than they did in the Republican landslide of 1994. And most shaken of all is the man whose name was not on the ballot yesterday: Barack Obama. What are his options now? What can he do to avoid defeat in 2010 serving as a mere overture to termination in 2012? How, in short, can Obama save his presidency? The glummest scenario for the stretch ahead predicts gridlock, with the newly Republican house thwarting Obama at every turn. A hobbled president, unable to get anything done, could be forced to watch as the American economy stagnates further: he may want to jolt it with an extra stimulus but he'll be powerless. House Republicans, elected partly by slamming the first stimulus as excessive and ineffective, will block it. The result will be an economy stuck in the ditch all the way till 2012, when voters will – fairly or unfairly – blame the man at the top and turf Obama out of office. It will be a rerun of the mid-recession campaign that ejected the first George Bush in 1992. As for the next two years, they will be a living hell of congressional ""investigations"", as Republican committee chairmen abuse their positions to hold spurious hearings, issuing copious subpoenas designed to shroud Obama in the murky gloom of ""ethics"" issues. It will be 24 months of agonised paralysis that ends in electoral defeat. The more hopeful scenario – and some Democrats cherish this one so fervently they actively hoped for the defeat that came last night – is that this Republican victory gives Obama what he has so far lacked: a lightning rod. When Democrats were in sole control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, there was nobody to blame for the country's woes but Democrats (memories are too short to recall the Bush era that ended centuries ago in 2008). With Republicans now partly at the helm, the blame can be spread around. What's more, the electorate will have got at least some of their anti-incumbent fervour out of their system. If they hadn't thoroughly punished the Democrats this time around – but had instead allowed the party to cling to power – then a greater wave of retribution would surely have broken in 2012, one that could well have drowned Obama. The cherry on top of this vision of the future sees the economy brighten, so that Obama cruises to re-election just as surely as Ronald Reagan did in 1984, two years after his own midterm rebuff. Which of these two scenarios materialises is not in the lap of the gods, with Obama a passive onlooker. Much of his fate is in his own hands – with the rest in the grasp of the newly empowered Republicans. If he wants to make that more hopeful, latter vision come true he'll have to borrow from the playbook written by Bill Clinton after the Republican takeover of 1994. He would use the next two years to expose his opponents as dangerous extremists, threatening to destroy much that the voters hold dear – with himself as the valiant shield standing in their way. This is what one senior Democrat calls the ""counterpunch presidency"", allowing the Republicans to lash out just enough to damage themselves. In 1995, the Republicans followed the script perfectly, their anti-government fervour so intense they eventually shut down the entire federal bureaucracy, so denying Americans vital benefits and services. A year later, voters were eager to re-elect Clinton as the brake on a runaway Republican juggernaut. Such a plan fits neatly with what some in the administration see as the natural work of the next two years, namely protecting the achievements of the first two. If they have their way, Obama will not even attempt to pass much new legislation but will focus instead on protecting his landmark reform of healthcare and maintaining the flow of recovery money – rather than letting the Republicans undo either. But there are dangers. For one thing, the Republicans might have learned from their 1990s experience and act more reasonably this time round. (Mind you, given that some Tea Party fire-breathers laud the 1995 shutdown as an act of ideological heroism, and that Tea Party heroes Rand Paul and Marco Rubio are now installed as US senators, that is by no means guaranteed.) For another, it requires the rarest political dexterity to preside over two years of stasis and have everyone blame the other side. Clinton had just such agility, but Obama is cut from different cloth. Which is why he might look to the other chapters in the Clinton playbook. The former president knew he needed a record of achievement to run on, so he forged compromises with the Republicans, chiefly by co-opting and adapting signature items from their programme, including welfare reform and increased police numbers. Obama could repeat the trick, chiefly on the economy but also perhaps on education, immigration reform, arms control or trade agreements. Then in 2012 he could seek re-election as the president who got things done. Such a pragmatic approach would have the added benefit of making good on the promise that made Obama – the dream of a post-partisan politics in which there were no red states or blue states, ""just the United States of America"". When Democrats were in sole charge Obama lost sight of that message, even though it had been central to his appeal in 2008: astonishingly, he barely met some of the key Republican leaders in Congress during his first two years in office. This then is a strategy for the next two years, ""counterpunch and co-opt"", in the words of that senior Democrat. Of course, it does not depend entirely on Obama. He can't dance unless the Republicans agree to be his partner, unless they themselves fear facing the electorate in 2012 with nothing to show for their spell in control. Still, much now comes down to how the president handles his new situation. One close adviser marvels at the ""deep equanimity"" with which his boss faces adversity. After what happened last night, he will need not just Zen calm, but nimble ingenuity, an improved economy, and a big slab of luck. • This is an updated version of the article by Jonathan Freedland published on Tuesday 2 November",Midterm election results: a wake-up call for Barack Obama | Jonathan Freedland,2010-11-03T10:43:14Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"In the White House last week, when the polls were already forecasting a midterm drubbing, they were comforting themselves with a simple, if basic, thought. No matter how meaty a punch the US electorate was about to aim at the Democratic solar plexus, one senior administration official told me, ""We're still here on 3 November."" Sure, that was setting the bar low, drawing consolation from the constitutional fact that, no matter how calamitous the results for Democrats in Congress, Barack Obama would still have two more years to run on his White House lease. But the remark meant more. It was part pep talk – as that official put it, the Obama team will now just have ""to take a deep breath and go forward"" – and part recognition that the president is a fixed point in a political landscape about to change radically. They might have been worrying unduly. As I write, no votes have been counted, and it is at least theoretically possible that the Democrats defy the number crunchers and cling to control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate. But that would be an upset to match Truman's 1948 victory. So let's assume the experts are right and Obama wakes tomorrow morning to new geography, with the House at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue in what he might call – and later regret calling – ""enemy"" hands. What are his options now? What can he do to avoid defeat in 2010 serving as a mere overture to termination in 2012? How, in short, can Barack Obama save his presidency? The glummest scenario predicts gridlock, with the House thwarting every Obama initiative.

"Halloween originated in this country – did you know that? Do you even care? Probably not, because while Americans have long embraced the night of the undead and made it their own, the British continue to suck at it. Our idea of Halloween is shops selling plastic-pumpkin trick-or-treat buckets and traipsing around with children in witches' hats, half-heartedly demanding Curly Wurlys from the neighbours. The child-free tend to ignore it and who can blame them? What's the point of putting aside a special day to celebrate Halloween when popular culture is H-infested all year round? When I was a girl, I remember reading Misty comic, Pan horror books or watching a ""camptastic!"" Hammer film, all on my lonesome. These days, this kind of solitary teen appreciation wouldn't be allowed. Before you had time to stick the torch under your chin to spin a spooky yarn, the franchise would come to get you to eat you up – force you out of your bedroom with a cattle prod to scream until you're hoarse at Twilight's ""lush"" Robert Pattinson. Never mind that Pattinson is the lamest vampire in cinematic history; Count Dracula via Hollyoaks, with Kristen Stewart as his singlet-wearing, hair-straightened Mean Girl queen. It doesn't matter – this is what the undead look like these days, even when, as with True Blood, it's all done rather beautifully. And it's not just vampires, but ghosts, zombies, witches, demons – these days, you can't move for the sexed-up undead. It won't be long before we get female zombies pausing in their terrible lurching and brain-eating to get their tits out for the lads. There will come a time when it's seen as taboo and repellent to have a screen romance between two characters, neither of whom is a vampire (""Two humans kissing – it's an abomination!""). With the odd recent exception (True Blood, 30 Days of Night, Dead Set, certain episodes of Dr Who), they may as well bundle all the dross together and call it Transylvania 90210. Does this matter? In a way, it does. I'm not sure that the youth of today are getting the phantoms they deserve. When I was young, I remember being genuinely rattled, and moved, when I came across Nosferatu, Salem's Lot, Night of the Living Dead, The Exorcist and Near Dark. ""Young people"" scoffed at yoof-appeal, crossover vamp-movies such as The Lost Boys. These days, that's all that's on offer. It's as if we have culturally defanged and emasculated the undead to the point where they've become same-old and boring. Perhaps it's time to claim back the walking corpses. Not from all teenagers, just from the ones who turn up at Twilight premieres with ""Bite Me"" printed on their T-shirts and who seem to want vampires to resemble someone who might have made it into X Factor's One Direction. It seems to say something about the British public that everyone is so laidback about young girls yearning for grey-faced bloodsuckers. On Halloween (on any day), the true bogeymen, the only creatures who really frighten the British public, are paedophiles. You open the door and there are kids dressed as spectre-this or phantom-that, and anxious parents at the gate, hovering to make sure you haven't drugged the jelly babies. I can't blame them (mainly because I'm one of them). Modern life being what it is, it isn't Halloween in the sense of ghouls and ghosts, it's just another round of paedo-watch. If Halloween were reshot in modern Britain, Michael Myers would never get any slashing done because the overprotective parents would be phoning Jamie Lee Curtis every five minutes to check on the children. And there you have it – the reason why so much of the contemporary horror oeuvre is going for laughs and romance rather than chills. It's no longer the monsters we're afraid of – it's each other. You may now kiss the bride, western infidel Maldivian officials have apologised following YouTube footage of Muslim insults thrown at a western couple, renewing their marital vows at the Vilu Reef resort. They didn't realise that the man in charge of the ceremony was intoning the likes of: ""You are swine. Your children, bastard swine. Keep fornicating. You are infidels."" Charming. Was confetti thrown? Or bricks? It was dreadful for the couple, but let's not turn it into a religious episode. I have watched the footage – it's clearly done by bored staff for a joke. Besides, why are people running off to the places such as the Maldives for these ceremonies, if not to avoid embarrassing incidents (and relatives) on their home soil? Plenty of gruesome things happen at British weddings, which is presumably why these overseas ones are so enduringly popular. The insults were pretty bad, but, arguably, the couple got what they came for – the chance to pay the equivalent of £820 to ""mark a milestone in your amazing journey together"". Well, memorable it certainly was. They won't be forgetting the day they were labelled ""infidel motherfuckers"" in a hurry. Wow! Talk about sleeping sickness A man has been cleared of sexually assaulting a woman as she slept, after a jury accepted he was asleep at the time, a medical condition known as sexsomnia. The rationale is that as it happened while he was asleep, he could not have known what he was doing. We have to accept the court's verdict in this case, but think of the potential. Does this mean that I can get away with being mendacious and libellous in this column because of my long-standing typesomnia (""George Osborne enjoys wearing ladies' underwear… zzzz"")? Then there is my drunksomnia – appearing to be disgustingly inebriated while actually being fast asleep. I regularly suffered from this over the years, and now realise it was a terrible illness, for which I should have received sympathy and medical attention, not widespread judgment or restraining orders. A friend has just informed me that she suffers from spendsomnia – where she ""wakes up"" after shopping trips to realise that she has maxxed out her boyfriend's credit card. Never her own. Bizarre. Other women report cases of relationshipsomnia, where the partner appears to be half-asleep, preoccupied and ""just not there"", for their entire association, though for males this condition is more popularly known as ""normal"". It's shocking to realise just how many somnias could be out there affecting us all. There could even be secondary somnias – for instance, while suffering from drunksomnia, I vividly recall incidents of snogsomnia (and the rest) with highly unsuitable types, who themselves swiftly came down with sexsomnia. Which gives rise to a chilling thought: could I have unwittingly been a sexsomnia–carrier? It is clear to me now that I've been behaving like a complete idiot, while snoozing, for my entire life.

"From Trafalgar Square walk down Whitehall to Downing Street and stop. From this point on, the government in the 1960s wanted you to enter somewhere quite different, a British Stalingrad of concrete and glass slabs stretching to Westminster Abbey and Victoria Street. It was to obliterate acres of the city where now stand the Foreign Office, the Treasury, Richmond Terrace and New Scotland Yard, as far as the houses of parliament and across to St James's Park. Nor was that all. The Mall was to be lined with more slabs and decks, like London Wall in the City. The Strand was to become a dual carriageway, and Covent Garden vanish under a forest of office towers. British Rail was to rebuild St Pancras, Paddington and Victoria to look like Euston. The centres of Leeds, Liverpool and Manchester were to be demolished, replaced by something like central Birmingham or Nottingham's Maid Marian Way. We have forgotten, who ever knew, how close familiar Britain came in the 60s to going the way of eastern Europe. Those who regarded themselves as in the van of taste wanted British cities demolished. The architecture and town planning professions, led by the Royal Institute of British Architects, were almost universally destructive. Victorian Britain was derided as ugly, largely because it stood in the way of fees. Scorn was heaped on Gilbert Scott's Foreign Office and his St Pancras hotel. The only Victorian buildings mostly left sacrosanct were places of worship. Nobody could afford to rebuild them. To celebrate its 50th birthday, the Victorian Society has published Victorians Revalued, a book recalling its battle honours. It is a noble record. Back in the 60s the society was the SAS of the conservation movement. It was founded after the demolition of the Euston Arch in 1961, a vandalism personally approved by the philistine Harold Macmillan, desperate to appear modern. Two environment ministers, Geoffrey Rippon and Peter Walker, planned to demolish the ""government precinct"", including the Foreign Office, and the entire eastern side of Bishopsgate in the City. The architects Leslie Martin and Colin Buchanan proposed to flatten the south end of Whitehall from Downing Street to the river, and the houses of parliament. Five years of relentless campaigning by the Victorian Society defeated most of these plans. At the same time, with Nikolaus Pevsner and John Betjeman in lead, the society saved St Pancras. Next came a signal triumph over the Greater London Council at Covent Garden. In Liverpool, battle was joined against Graeme Shankland's plan to demolish the entire city centre, at the same time as T Dan Smith's Newcastle started to vanish under the wrecker's ball. The story of these campaigns reads like a history of the Great War. Lost were the battles of Eaton and Trentham halls, the Coal Exchange and Barings bank in the City, the Imperial Institute in Kensington, Birmingham's Central library and Leeds's Park Row. Won were the battles of Carlton House Terrace, Covent Garden, King's Cross and Liverpool's Albert Dock. A climax came in 1974 with the V&A's sensationally successful 1974 exhibition, The Destruction of the English Country House. Before then a house was being destroyed almost every week; afterwards destruction virtually ceased. Never was art more potent. It is hard in retrospect to appreciate how cliff-edge were these David and Goliath contests, and how desperately alone were the Davids. Against them were big money, big government and big architecture. The RIBA represented not a profession, let alone an art, but a financial lobby. At public inquiries, developers and architects called witnesses to argue for demolition – often corrupt art historians – whose payments were never revealed. Those whose sole concern was public aesthetics had to use their own time and money. Time and again they won. The survival of Victorian Britain was their reward. The story was not just public against private interest. It needed a revolution in taste. The architectural historian Harry Goodhart-Rendel lectured in the 30s that ""it was well-known that Victorian architecture was either bad or screamingly funny, or both"". A National Trust secretary wrote in 1954 of the ""vulgarity"" of the Rothschild palace of Waddesdon, ""artificially plonked on a pristine English landscape in all its horror"". John Summerson, while exulting in London's regimented Georgian terraces, replied to Betjeman's plea to help save St Pancras that he found the place ""as a whole nauseating"". Even today Colin Cunningham, the Victorian Society's former chairman, writes that ""there are still a good many art enthusiasts for whom anything between Robert Adam and the Arts and Crafts movement is vulgar and undesirable"". What crippled the reputation of Victorian architecture was the identification of progress with clearance and modernism, with minimalist abstraction and whiteness. Old buildings were places of soot and gloom. To like them was a political statement, redolent of outdated mansions, outdated railways, outdated municipalism and outdated religion. Many factors brought about a change. The charm of Betjeman's poetic propaganda depicted the 19th century not as grimly Dickensian but as quaint and loveable (helped by ITV's Upstairs Downstairs). Clean air and restoration revealed the decorative subtlety of the Victorians' gothic and classical themes. Even Summerson repented. ""Surfeited as we are with the fruits of the Modern movement,"" he wrote, ""with its boring slabs and daunting towers, everything Victorian has a delicious impact of strangeness and curiosity."" Faced with the sheer tedium of most modern architecture, the 19th century seemed rich, colourful and lively. Yet this story raises an intriguing question. Just as the 20th century eye detested the aesthetic inheritance of the 19th, so are we being accustomed to detest the inheritance of the 20th century? As we delight in Butterfield and Waterhouse, Pugin and Millais, Burne-Jones and Morris, are we ignoring some obscure subtlety in Lasdun, Seifert, Spence, Foster and Rogers? I cannot believe it. Most, if not all, buildings erected in Britain between 1940 and 1980 seem to me bland computer-designed concrete and glass shapes on which no aesthetic eye has ever deigned to fall. Like Summerson, I find such towers and blobs lack respect for urban context or human scale. I long for Victorian qualities of decorative warmth and intimacy so lacking in the Modernist revival. Yet the lesson I draw from the story of the Victorian Society is of humility to the recent past. Perhaps I need educating in the virtues of soaring towers and unadorned surfaces. Perhaps one day a 21st Century Society will struggle to preserve Canary Wharf, when its girders rust, its glass cracks and grass grows over its concrete decks – preserve it against a retro-Victorian developer and a Poplar Portmeirion. Perhaps I should admit that we are all children of our time and place. But I still salute the warriors who saved Whitehall.",They saved our Victorian cities.

"The august ranks of those who form the conventional wisdom in American politics are as one: Barack Obama's Democrats are going to take a hammering in next Tuesday's midterm elections. One of the few elements of the Obama record not blamed is also, paradoxically, one of those areas that need to change on 3 November. It is the administration's handling of the peace process between Israelis and Palestinians. Consensus is famously rare in these matters, but there's a striking degree of agreement both among the parties themselves and seasoned Washington hands that things have gone badly wrong. A president who was inaugurated amid great hopes – generally and for the Middle East in particular – has seen his stock tumble in the intervening 21 months. Obama won great credit for making Israeli-Palestinian peace a priority on his very first day in office, declaring it a national security interest of the US, and for appointing the elder statesman of the Northern Ireland effort, George Mitchell, as his special envoy. Since then there have been crockery-throwing rows with the Israelis, and a nice speech in Cairo, but little tangible progress. The most Obama has to show for his labours is an opening round of direct talks between the two sides, currently on hold. Ask those involved what explains the journey from hope to disappointment, and they all start in the same place: the US administration's early demand that Israel cease all settlement building in the occupied West Bank before any talks could begin. Make no mistake, Palestinians and plenty of others would like nothing more than just such an outcome; their objection was not to the substance of the demand but to the politics of it. Even the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, would tell visitors to his Ramallah compound the ultimatum was a mistake. Negotiations had taken place before without a settlement freeze, but once the precondition had been made Abbas had to insist on it too. As Abbas would put it: ""This has put me up a tree and I have no ladder down."" Others say the demand itself was perfectly reasonable; the problem was that the US did not stick to it. Rather than hold firm, it found itself haggling, eventually compromising on a partial, temporary freeze. Put simply, America blinked. The result was a loss of face from which the administration has not recovered. That first phase – of calibrated confrontation with Israel – reached a climax in March, when Vice-President Joe Biden visited the country only to be greeted by the announcement of more house-building in east Jerusalem. Neither he nor Obama kept their fury to themselves. The problem with the initial approach, says Daniel Levy of the Washington thinktank the New America Foundation, is that Obama had not yet ""established his bona fides with the Israeli people"". If Obama wanted to speak over the heads of the Israeli leadership, as Bill Clinton had done before him, he needed first to reassure Israelis that he was not the ""Barack Hussein Obama"" of hostile mythology. But he made no such move. He didn't do so much as a single set-piece interview with the Israeli media. Instead, the vacuum was filled with what Levy believes was a ""concerted campaign to undermine Obama with the Israeli public"", one backed by a Binyamin Netanyahu determined not to repeat the experience he underwent in the 1990s, when a US president more popular with Israelis than himself was able to push him to the peace table. Either way, after the Biden standoff the White House changed course, concluding that confrontation was bearing little fruit. What's followed has been a classic Washington over-correction. As Mitchell's prominence has waned, the veteran US mediator Dennis Ross has gained influence – and Ross's approach, says one non-admirer, is ""you do whatever is the maximum the Israelis will do"". The advantage of such a strategy is that it's realistic, understanding that, as a defender puts it: ""Ultimately, if you want to move forward, you're going to have to work with the government of Israel, not against it."" The downside is that it fails to push the Israelis to move. Which brings us to the round of talks that began in September and has been on ice since Israel allowed its partial settlement freeze to expire. Here the protagonists are scathing. ""The Americans are desperate,"" says a Palestinian adviser. ""They have no idea what they're doing or what they're doing it for."" The criticism starts with the basis on which the talks are conducted. There are no terms of reference, no letter to the parties as there was before the Madrid conference of 1991, no parameters laid out by the Americans as there was before Camp David in 2000. The two sides are just meant to get on with it. What's more, adds the Palestinian insider, Washington is ""frittering away its best cards"". Anxious to keep Netanyahu at the table, the US has dangled before him a string of ""inducements"", ranging from the right to purchase F35 fighter planes – which no one else in the world has – to tolerance of a continued Israeli military presence along the Jordan valley, perhaps for up to 30 years after any peace deal, thereby boxing in a future Palestinian state on both its eastern and western borders. Others note the behind-the-scenes efforts Washington continually makes, ""working the phones"" to foreign capitals to shield Israel from severe international criticism or isolation, including smoothing the path for membership of the OECD earlier this year. ""What's it all for?"" asks one observer, incredulous that the US is apparently offering all these goodies in return for nothing more than a temporary extension of Israel's partial settlement freeze, perhaps for 60 days. More alarming, one involved close up says that Washington is offering what it cannot deliver: hinting at concessions to the Palestinians, for instance promising a state broadly on the 1967 lines, that Israel has not yet agreed to. It does indeed carry the whiff of desperation, suggesting an administration doing somersaults to avoid another public failure. There is a case for the defence. It gives credit to Obama for sticking with an issue that his predecessor long preferred to ignore and that almost always drains rather than enhances presidential prestige. It notes that Israel, whether through the initial stick or the later carrots, has moved a bit: some say the very act of freezing settlements has forced Israel to admit they are a problem that cannot be sustained indefinitely. And it points out the undeniable truth that the lack of success is hardly the exclusive fault of the US: the parties themselves are weak, with Abbas ruling over only one half of a divided people, while Netanyahu – even if he is sincere about wanting to do a deal, as he insists – is constrained by coalition partners of the dogmatic right. Nevertheless, the post-midterm reckoning should include an honest analysis of what's gone wrong in one of the president's key foreign policy priorities, and a plan for what to do next. That could include setting out an Obama plan for the region and compelling the parties to negotiate around it. It could mean finding a new path between the ill-considered pressure on Israel of 2009 and the unreciprocated generosity towards it of recent months. Whatever course Obama chooses – and he will deserve admiration for not simply washing his hands of the entire mess – he does need to change course. To borrow a phrase from his secretary of state, it's time to hit the reset button.",Credit to Obama for sticking with the Middle East.

"One of my presents for the Christmas of 1956 was a fat little book called All About Ships and Shipping, edited by EP Harnack and very nicely got up by Faber & Faber with semaphore flags and rolling waves impressed on its blue cloth binding. Its prettiness helps explain its survival in boxes and cupboards for more than half a century, its original tuition (example: how to tell a barque from a brigantine) long forgotten. This week I took it out to look at the Royal Navy's fleet list in that long-ago era. Classes were lined up below their different silhouettes: cruisers, minelayers, destroyers, frigates, monitors, minesweepers, torpedo boats. There was still one battleship in service, the Vanguard, a turreted shape I can just remember seeing through a North Sea mist, but the biggest surprise was the number of aircraft carriers: Ark Royal, Eagle, Indomitable, Illustrious, Implacable, Indefatigable, Formidable … their bulldog names went on over two pages. There were 22 in all, and even if only half of them were actually sailing the high seas, the rest would have been mothballed with engines and guns greased and ready for war. Very soon, when the Ark Royal and its Harrier jets are scrapped, the Navy will be left for the next 10 years without a ship capable of flying aircraft, until the first of the two carriers now under construction is commissioned. The entire surface fleet will amount to no more than 19 warships; my little book tells me that one class of destroyers alone, the C class (Cavalier, Cossack, Crispin), had more. My point isn't to contest the wisdom of shrinking the fleet – I'm not a military strategist – but to suggest how much can change in a lifetime and not be registered as change until an incredible event occurs (incredible, that is, to people of a certain age, background and disposition). It comes as a kind of assault on the memory. A fleet without an aircraft carrier! My short-trousered, ship-watching self would have boggled at the impossibility. But all the while since the navy has been losing dockyards, ships and crew – like a long, lulling sentence punctuated with commas and waking up finally with an exclamation mark. But the end of the Ark Royal is the least of it. Britain is about to become a different country. Everybody agrees about this, with varying degrees of exultation or foreboding depending on their reading of government policy: a pulling back from the brink or a tip forward into the abyss, a leaner, fitter and more dynamic country or a smaller, meaner, more divided one. This kind of political rupture to the drift of national life is rare in peacetime history. It happened under the governments formed in 1945 and 1979, but the other big postwar date (1956, the year of Suez and my nautical Christmas gift) affected Britain's idea of itself more than the texture of ordinary lives. Never again could the state pretend to imperial power, but the people who lived in it trickled around this fissure like ants, and grew slowly but steadily richer. Next month the British Film Institute launches a retrospective of documentaries that were made during that 30-year era known as the postwar settlement. Boom Britain, the season's overall title, strikes a deliberately historic note that wouldn't have worked four or five years ago, when it could just as easily have labelled a season by current filmmakers rather than those working between 1951 and 1977. But the title turns out to be not entirely accurate: some films shine with the classic boom qualities of confidence and optimism, but others don't. They reflect concerns that are still current – the environment, women's rights, mental illness, lonely old age, abused children – and that perhaps offers the first lesson about any study of the past: that its division into tight little periods, each different to the next, can never be more than a crude and sometimes misleading generalisation. This thought, in fact, inspired the BFI's retrospective. According to Patrick Russell, its curator, the project is an act of revisionism designed to correct and enlarge the conventional history of the British documentary movement. Roughly, this story goes as follows. In the beginning was a 1929 film about herring drifters directed by John Grierson, who coined the noun ""documentary"" to describe films that dealt in ""the creative treatment of actuality"". Under Grierson's influence, several young filmmakers emerged in the 1930s who were passionately committed to social change. The brilliant wartime propaganda of Humphrey Jennings made him the most famous of them. And then after 1945 came a ""black hole"", in Russell's words; Lindsay Anderson and his ""Free Cinema"" school made a few memorable films in the late 1950s, but by then television has staked ownership to the documentary technique. The phrase ""British cinema documentary"" came to mean a black and white collage of steam locomotives, slag heaps, women in grubby kitchens and men in flat caps, searchlights and bomb damage. Certainly, that's what it meant to me. Of course, I should have known better. Anyone who grew up in the 1950s and 60s usually sat through a short, British-made non-fiction film at the cinema. We watched them impatiently – why were we learning about artificial fibre production when we'd paid to see Kirk Douglas? Later, we also watched them dubiously – what were the funders of these films, Shell or BP or the National Coal Board, trying in some insidious way to sell us? As it turns out, nothing very terrible. The BFI has made a four-DVD set (titled Shadows of Progress and soon to be released) and most films on it wear their sponsorship lightly; sometimes, as with a BP film on the world's finite resources, they're even antagonistic to its interests. There is just as much lyricism and sympathy to be found in them as in the prewar school, and their directors, photographers and scriptwriters deserve to be rescued from the charge that their backing by government agencies or big business necessarily compromised their art. Sometimes, of course, it may have done. One of my favourites is Britain Today, made in 1964 for the Foreign Office to show abroad. James Cameron, whose last work as a great liberal journalist was a weekly column in the Guardian, wrote and narrated the script. The film marches us around the United Kingdom and, goodness, what a promising place it looks. One wishes one lived there. New car plants, schools and universities, new nuclear power stations, Trident jets and blue Pullman trains. ""Nothing can stand still,"" says Cameron as wrecking balls tear down Glasgow tenements. ""The useless old must go."" There are some unexpected moments. The crowd singing Jerusalem at the Proms is remarkably decorous, standing still as they sing and waving no flags, but these scenes follow a sequence of young people jiving: ""Britain is very old – and very young."" This is the film's trope. Britain is a country ""sustained by its past … confident of overcoming the challenges in the long years to come"". A different and unrelated Cameron could have spoken the same script yesterday. The facts may be different, count them as you will in naval fleets, public debt or balances of trade. But the rhetoric used to address Britain's problematic future never changes – it takes us forward or backwards to the new age.",A British fleet with no aircraft carrier.

"In 1942 William Beveridge's report on social insurance was a national bestseller: with memories of the 30s still vivid, wartime Britain had an enormous appetite for the promise that the postwar world would be different. The scant support for millions locked, through no fault of their own, in the ""five evils"" – want, disease, ignorance, squalor and idleness – had been a disgrace. There had to be change. Beveridge knew full well that unless any welfare system is based on the contribution principle – citizens pay in and earn the benefit as their due desert – the principle of welfare soon gets degraded. The more taxpayers contribute, the more they will ask if welfare beneficiaries really deserve what they are receiving. The pressure is now on to make benefits ever meaner and ever more tightly means-tested, because, as George Osborne put it this week, why should ordinary working families pay taxes for people to live on benefit? Beveridge's solution was to create a system of social insurance into which everyone paid to insure themselves against life's inevitable hazards – old age, disability, sickness and unemployment. He proposed a national insurance system to pay unemployment benefit, disability benefit and pensions. Every citizen would pay in; every citizen would receive their benefit as an universal entitlement. There could be no means test, no criticism that beneficiaries were fiddling honest tax-payers. Philosophers and psychologists now recognise what Beveridge knew in his bones: that human beings intuitively believe we are all, to some extent, responsible for our actions – the sentiment that the anti-welfare state brigade tap when they want to differentiate between the deserving and undeserving poor. The only way to trump that thinking is a system of social or national insurance, which the British left has been as guilty as the right in allowing to be abused as just another tax. Yes, William Beveridge is one of my heroes. We need his thinking no less urgently today.",My hero William Beveridge,2010-10-22T23:07:21Z,Will Hutton,review

"The thing about rescuing the Chilean miners is that there's no such thing as overreacting. There's no such thing as too many presidents in attendance, even if the lone rescued Bolivian might have been a little surprised to see Evo Morales. There's no such thing as too many journalists – there have been 2,000 of them waiting at the site, which averages 61 per miner. A trauma expert wrote today that the most important thing to avert long-term psychological damage was that those trapped felt they could speak, and would be listened to. He probably didn't mean an international hoard of strangers. But at least there isn't a shortage. One's instinct is to distrust an emotional response like this, because it's so random. What's a living definition of sentimentality, if not this heightened, secondhand euphoria for the survivors of an accident so unremarkable in a dangerous industry? And yet I feel euphoric. I don't care if it's sentimental. I don't judge Oakley for sending in sunglasses, even though it's blatant product placement in the one film that the whole world will watch. I don't judge the lingerie shop in Copiapó, which sent all the wives and girlfriends fancy pants, after the miners put in a mischievous request that their beloveds' knicker drawers be refreshed (Cristina Nunez, girlfriend of Claudio Yanez, said ""my boyfriend wants me to buy a baby doll negligee. I am going to do that because we're getting drenched in each other's love by every passing day."") Actually this product placement was not very effective, since I cannot tell you the name of the lingerie supplier: so this most likely wasn't marketing but a genuine act of kindness. The Japanese space agency sent pants down for the men – not because they were drenched in love, but rather, might be drenched in moisture and odour, for which these garments are specially adapted. This is what puts men on the moon, people. Nasa, for its part, sent down spacesuits for the men to wear as they travelled back to the surface. It doesn't need publicity, it's Nasa. But perhaps it could use more publicity for its lesser-known quality of human kindness? It's hard to tell with an event like this: what is the line between joining in a global outpouring and jumping on a global bandwagon? But I'm asking the wrong question. It's not should I jump or shouldn't I; the question is: why this tragedy? Why these men? What's the peculiarity of this plight that has made it so compelling and so moving? It's partly the timespan – between 5 and 22 August, the miners were presumed dead and the world's current affairs had been unaffected. When Jose Ojeda wrote the famous note: ""We are all well here in the refuge – the 33"", it was resurrection, in narrative terms, the men had come back to life. At this point, the sheer technical difficulty of bringing them back gave another positive tilt to the story. Disasters generally leave the observer feeling impotent: the task after a tsunami or during a famine is sprawling and unending, there is never enough of anything, there is no such thing as perfect closure since, even if endless supplies were to materialise, there is so much loss already borne. Nobody is likely to emerge skipping. And besides, what's needed is money – so, as an observer, you insulate yourself against pity to a degree, because otherwise when do you stop? When you've sold your house? Here the opposite was true: engineers don't need donations, they just need cheerleaders. We can all manage that. Furthermore, just as the miners weren't discovered so much as resurrected on 22 August, so the redemption of their rescue is total. Human ingenuity was set a task, and it succeeded. There's also an empathetic response that is close to primal, when you hear about people stuck down holes. Confinement, suffocation, unending 93F heat – if you're not afraid of all of these, you are most likely afraid of one of them. In fact, miners tend not to be claustrophobic and are most affected by the heat: but almost everybody else knows this fear – it is one of the commonest phobias, and the power it wields over the imagination is great. The relatively small number of miners has enabled us to sympathise with them, to comprehend them as people rather than sanctify them (I refer, in particular, to Johnny Barrios, the one with the two ""wives"", though I think only one of them was technically married to him). In Timothy Snyder's new book on the Holocaust and second world war, he writes that the barbarism of mass killing is to turn people into numbers, and ""it is for us as humanists to turn the numbers back into people"". Natural disasters have the same effect, of course, so a huge scale will make single horrors invisible. Thirty-three is a number we can cope with: 100 times as many and the world would not have stopped. There would have been no Japanese pants. A backlash is inevitable – not against the miners but against the Chilean government, for its poor safety standards in mines, against the media with its feverish staring, against all of us, for the sheer disproportionality of this response. No event in the world could justify this blaze of attention. But there it is, a flash of global joy – to pretend to be unmoved, for the sake of authenticity, would be perverse.",Why has the Chilean miners' rescue left me this euphoric? | Zoe Williams,2010-10-13T18:30:40Z,Zoe Williams,world
"I cannot sew but I am sometimes forced to try. When a button fell useless from a new raincoat, the hotel sewing kit came out and took me back to a world of needles, threads, knots, eyes and back-stitches, somehow learned at my mother's knee. As I finished and tugged at the button, I felt a satisfaction unlike that of any intellectual pursuit. I am told it is the satisfaction produced by a bicycle mended, a dish cooked or a picture painted. It is handicraft completed, up and running. George Osborne this week called on the nation to revert to ""manufacturing"" and reject the culture of the City. Well he might. The credit crunch seems certain to lead to widespread graduate and white-collar unemployment, forcing young and old into work they would have considered beneath them a generation ago. Job-starved young people must go into cooking, gardening, decorating and personal services, even if they call them catering, landscaping, interior design and consulting. Eton now teaches cookery. Oxford has yet to pioneer a course in motorcycle maintenance. Ever since Ruskin deplored the onset of mass production, craftsmanship has been elevated as an intrinsic virtue. Only recently have psychologists and sociologists suggested that working with hands is more than just aesthetics, but is embedded in the human gene. Hands are what drew us from the slime. Thumbs differentiated us from other mammals. Neglect the hand and you distort, torture and dissatisfy the brain. That is why pianists live so long. When Matthew Crawford's The Case for Working with Your Hands came out last year it was treated as amusingly eccentric. ""Real men"" were told they should stop being slaves to their screens and Wi-Fis. They should drive nails into planks and wield spades and frying pans. Nor is this another case of the lawyer who became a plumber because the hourly rate was higher. Crawford did indeed notice that graduate entry into the American professions was plummeting, with those supposedly educated for them drifting into listless semi-employment, ""a state of uncommitted future potential"". But he also noted something quite different. He himself doubled as academic and motorbike mechanic, and wondered why he always tired after a day at the former yet felt strangely exhilarated by the manual labour of a newly restored motorbike. The sociologist Richard Sennett likewise noted a cerebral reward from playing the cello and cooking. In his book, Craftsmanship, he concluded that the handling of tools was far more than just a passing stage in human evolution. There were ""skills in manual labour that link hand and brain and which are still not recognised"". To Sennett it is cruel ""to assume downward mobility in those who love working with their hands"". It is a natural human activity. We likewise recognise the satisfaction a parent gets from caring for a baby. Childcare is skilled manual labour that delivers more than just family bonding. Until recently this might have seemed no more than counterintuitive pop psychology. There is more point to it now that thousands of people are unlikely to find work for which they were told they were being educated. The statistics of British graduate employment are unmistakable: a downturn in managerial, professional and financial jobs, and a rise in personal services and what are delicately called ""elementary occupations"". It suggests that the orthodoxy of the ""knowledge-based economy"" that still guides government policy should go into reverse. Consumer spending is shifting towards leisure and, within leisure, towards live activity. This covers ranges from specialist hobbies, exploring, riding, festivals, concerts, restaurants and tourism. Supporting these activities is labour-intensive. The skills they demand are, in part, personal ones, such as public relations and salesmanship. But many are literally hands-on and skilled – as in building, equipment maintenance, cooking and entertaining. The broken pipe and rotten wiring cannot be outsourced to India. They need craftsmanship here and now, apprenticed, reliable, dependable and regulated. Yet such skills are in short supply and rely on migrants from places such as Germany and east Europe where the tradition of high-status technical education and apprenticeship has not been eroded by ""humanities"". Supplying these skills requires a custom of craftsmanship that is alien to the tens of thousands of British arts graduates who would once have gone into technical colleges. Now they emerge as graduates trained to make 10-minute videos, or critique an episode of EastEnders. They seek jobs in film, theatre or the media, jobs that do not exist. To have a humanities graduate in the family these days is to run a compulsory private arts council. Crawford assaults the binary tradition of grammar versus technical schooling that developed through the 20th century, ""a partition of thinking from doing that has bequeathed us the dichotomy of white collar versus blue collar, mental versus manual"". In Britain this saw its apotheosis in the 1944 education act. The 11-plus test distinguished ""high aptitude"" as theoretical and grammar, from low aptitude which was technical and hand-working. It then enshrined the separatism in different institutions and, de facto, different social classes. The Thatcher/Major reforms made matters worse. They took so-called ""vocational"" institutions and let them become American-style liberal arts colleges. They stopped teaching skills, crafts and manufacturing, and the associated rule-based training. Instead they produced ""knowledge workers"" with minds, it was said, so well-rounded they would roll wherever pushed. If the career path that has been the assumption of British higher education for 50 years is outdated, the good news from the academics is that its replacement may be better adjusted to human nature. A key indicator is what many brain-workers do in leisure or retirement. The civil servant who plays chamber music, the lawyer who turns to cabinet-making or the banker who takes up cooking would once have been regarded as stepping down from their true calling and indulging in hobbies. Properly intellectual ""retirees"" dabbled in consultancy or wrote a novel. The message of Crawford and Sennett, as it was for Ruskin and Morris, is that there is nothing mentally subordinate in working by hand. The gardener, the cook, the needleworker or the craftsman is not pandering to some Ruskinian aesthetic. He or she is pursuing a route back to the inner self that may indeed be more direct than working solely with the head – or the screen. These are skills that cannot be mastered in a day. Many require disciplines learned over generations by trial and error and thus a structure of rule-based apprenticeship and training. They are thus woven into the custom of the community. But they may also be activities more attuned to the human body and brain than, say, reading or writing a book. Perhaps Milton's ""precious lifeblood of a master spirit"" has been sanctified too long.

"I don't have any truck with the idea that politicians must pander slavishly to the female vote. They shouldn't be treated as boy band members who must always look ""available"". They shouldn't be held to ransom because they can't name their favourite biscuit quickly enough. Still, it was interesting that as soon as it became apparent that Ed Miliband was not married to pregnant partner, and mother of his son, lawyer Justine Thornton, and that he hadn't got around to putting his name on his son's birth certificate, everyone instantly thought of fusty, scandalised middle England. The image was thrown up of someone in a twinset and pearls, laying her knitting in her lap, aghast at the immorality of it all. Really? It seems to me that Labour's new leader has very different women he should be worrying about. It's a fallacy that Miliband needs to fret about middle England matrons, most of whom would automatically hate him anyway. Surely the women Miliband should be most concerned about turning off right now are those who would normally be expected to vote for him. And turning them off he very probably is. I am speaking of the younger, more modern-thinking women, around Miliband's age, 40s, 30s, maybe even 20s, with or without children. The post Bridget Jones/Sex and the City generation. The same women who may have heard about the birth certificate story and spent the week glowering sourly at Ed over their chardonnay, thinking: ""Well, Mr Labour leader, don't you remind me of every selfish, feckless commitment-phobic waste of space I've ever known."" Where being unmarried is concerned, Miliband should be applauded for not racing down to the register office cynically to do the deed during the leadership campaign, definitely for refusing to propose on Daybreak. Thanks, Ed. After so long spent being terrorised by snippets of Tony and Cherie's sex life (all that talk of ""the love only she could give him""), such self-control could only be viewed as a blessed relief. However, the birth certificate thing is truly shocking and not just for fusty, old-fashioned middle England. How could Miliband not put his name on his child's birth certificate? How could Thornton not have repeatedly belted him over the head with one of her LK Bennett handbags until he did so? Miliband's defence (""Ha ha, bit embarrassing, I was too busy"") only made matters worse, blowing like so much tumbleweed through the nation's consciousness, doubtless triggering the collective female memory bank of feeble male excuses of our time. Miliband should have been warned that, in these circumstances, Boris Johnson-patented, bumbling faux charm is not the way to go. He should also mug up on recent social history, namely that many female voters have spent their lives dealing with a series of tricky, draining, male social experiments: lads, new lads, post-lads, post-post lads, metrosexuals and the rest. All these are men who have decided that they're not quite ready to commit and women should just toddle off and do their own thing and take that strange ticking noise with them. To these raddled, commitment-starved women, a certain Mr D Miliband resembles the archangel Gabriel; even David Cameron looks passably sweet. It won't be too long before the whispering campaign starts: ""What is wrong with him?"" So it's not just middle England Ed should be worried about, it's the people who would have automatically voted for him. Ultimately, women vote for issues, but just like those smitten trade unionists, they are also quite partial to someone they can believe in. Yippee, a heroine who finds time to feed the kids Winter's Bone, the cult hit film about an impoverished girl, Ree, trying to find out what happened to her drug-addict father, involves a lot of women – from writer-director Debra Granik to lead Jennifer Lawrence. However, for the real flavour of ""female"", one just has to note how, even in the midst of crisis, Ree is bogged down by domestic mundanity, caring for her younger siblings and incapacitated mother. Chilling violence is juxtaposed with childcare blips and making meals from scraps. When Ree tries to enlist in the army, she is scuppered by the fact she can't bring the children along. This is a female director talking and a clever, brave one at that. Most directors are men and into ""gritty reality"", as opposed to, say, ""real reality"". They would be terrified that scenes of drudgery would be ""boring"". Granik's brilliant film proves otherwise, with Ree's domestic entrapment adding to the sense of menace. Charles Bronson in Death Wish didn't pause to change the cat-litter tray, but maybe it would have been a more credible film if he had. This magazine's behind the curve Just as Beautiful – ""The new lifestyle magazine for curvy women"" – is troubling from the start. The plus-size cover model is garbed in a pink corset, teamed with stockings and suspenders. Exactly which shelf is this destined for? Clearly someone thought JAB would be a winning idea, but which woman is going to sit on public transport reading it? It's akin to holding a banner saying: ""Cooee, I'm fat!"" If the women in JAB aren't ""sexed up"" to the nines, they are musing about their weight, your weight, everybody else's weight, as if ""packing junk in the trunk"" were the only item of importance on the international agenda. It is also nonsense that big women can only bear to look at other big women. Women don't tend to gouge their eyes out in WH Smith because Glamour has Cheryl Cole on the cover. JAB should acknowledge that things are slowly (very slowly) getting better. Anyone who reads the more clued-up women's magazines knows that they've been urging readers to ""celebrate their curves"" for some time. It is now officially (and tediously) the law to do a ""Go girl!"" feature on Beth Ditto once every other issue. There's celebrating curves; then there's ghettoising, even fetishising. Many women in JAB appear to be somewhat bigger than size 16 (the average British female size). It's beyond luscious Joan from Mad Men – some images verge on Russ Meyer's giant comedy breasts territory. Sorry, Just as Beautiful, your intentions were good, but if it's aspirational glamour you're aiming for, then it's probably best to lose the corsets and don the thinking caps again.",Why Ed reminds women of every bad ex-boyfriend | Barbara Ellen,2010-10-02T23:07:46Z,Barbara Ellen,politics
"A shameful mess and absolutely typical of that contractors' city,"" said a friend in Kolkata when I asked him about the Commonwealth Games in Delhi. He meant that both contractors and politicians had made money, the second through bribes from the first, the first through the wide margin of profit offered by over-invoicing and cheap workers and workmanship. There is more to the mess than that – Delhi was unlucky this year to have had a prolonged monsoon and outbreaks of dengue fever – but coverage in the Indian media suggests the human factor should take most of the blame. The acronyms of the Indian government's anti-corruption agencies crop up frequently. The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) is keeping ""a hawk's eye"" on the 14 projects it has put ""under the scanner"". The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is looking into alleged financial irregularities that run into ""thousands of crores"" (a crore is 10 million rupees, roughly £143,000). Nothing is sacred. Two members of the Games' organising committee were suspended following inquiries into the progress through London of the Queen's baton relay, which set off from Buckingham Palace in October last year. I was struck by my friend's phrase: that contractors' city. In a hundred years, Delhi's population has grown from 400,000 to about 18 million and is expected to grow by another 40% by 2020, when it will be the world's third-largest urban agglomeration after Tokyo and Mumbai. None of this frightening enlargement would have been, or will be, possible without contractors to build the homes and the infrastructure. London likes to think of its Olympic park as a significant challenge in terms of planning and construction, but London is a city in stasis compared to Delhi. To a Londoner, the word ""contractor"" suggests nothing very much – Irish labourers, once upon a time – but a Delhi-ite has a more concrete picture of individual energy, wealth and political connection. The city's history partly accounts for it. Which contractors built Victorian London is a question even a well-informed architectural historian might struggle to answer, but ask the same of Delhi's 20th-century history and many of its citizens will know. When I first saw Delhi in the 1970s, it was still recognisable as the city that the English architects Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker had planned as the new capital of British India: ""The most magnificent as well as the most ambitious architectural project ever undertaken by a British government,"" in the words of the writer Gavin Stamp. Delhi, of course, already existed; it was an old capital of the Mughal empire, and as an important place of human settlement it stretched back for centuries before the Mughals arrived. Among the scattered ruins of these earlier rulers – tombs, forts, mosques – New Delhi arose as the replacement for Kolkata, to give the British administration a distance from the rising nationalist hubbub in Bengal. King George V announced the move at his Delhi Durbar of 1911 and the nearly finished city was inaugurated in 1931 – ""five minutes before closing time"", as Nikolaus Pevsner once remarked. In 1977, 30 years after the Raj had closed, New Delhi was still characterised by its broad tree-lined avenues and neoclassical bungalows. It was a one- and two-storey kind of town at its centre, remarkably open and green. Sometimes its residents said it was dull – ""too many bureaucrats"" – but it had a cultured class, generous to strangers, which included several notable people called Singh who edited magazines, wrote newspaper columns, ran restaurants and galleries and were socially committed. Few of these activities were very profitable, and yet these Singhs lived well, in the kind of home usually then given over to foreign diplomats and non-governmental organisations. Any mystery in the contradiction was shortlived. Everybody knew that their fathers and grandfathers had made fortunes as the contractors who built New Delhi to the designs of Lutyens and Baker. Several were Sikhs from western Punjab and the most celebrated of them, Sobha Singh, was rewarded with a knighthood for his professionalism. Contractors on the New Delhi project had employed thousands of men (perhaps children, too) to build a city from scratch. Hills had been demolished, railways laid, palaces built, stone in millions of cubic feet cut, transported and erected: in Delhi, to be known as a contractor's grandchild involved no shame because, si monumentum requiris, circumspice, what they saw around them was their grandfather's work. Did the contractors offer bribes to win their commissions? There's no evidence to suggest so. The code of the Indian civil service allowed no gift greater than fruit or flowers and in the 1920s the morality within imperialism was probably at its highest (though, then again, the secrets of the hierarchy in those days were generally better kept). In other ways, however, the story of the Commonwealth Games can find echoes in the past. Lutyens, fretting that his grand viceregal palace would never be finished, complained about the workmanship. ""The Indian never finishes anything,"" he wrote, ""and breaks 50% of what he temporarily fixes so that the amount of making good shall be at least 25% of the work done and at the cost of another 25% … there is not near enough skilled supervision and no one seems to care so long as they can get to their clubs, gymnasiums and whist and bridge drives."" Lutyens certainly wasn't the most sympathetic visitor India has ever seen – ""They want me to do Hindu [architecture]. Hindon't I say"" – but perhaps he was right to fret. In March 1927 a brick fell from the ceiling of the newly completed legislative chamber and nearly brained Field Marshal Sir William Birdwood. A later letter in the Times from the building's architect, Baker, insisted the fallen object had been merely an acoustic tile that had been insecurely fixed in damp plaster during ""the extreme dry heat of an Indian summer"". The same alarm, and the same response, met the news last month that few pieces of plastic ceiling had dropped to the floor of the wrestling venue. In the end, the vistas and public buildings of Lutyens' and Baker's New Delhi came to be seen as a triumph. Their work gives the modern city its distinction, which the international modernism of sports stadia and athletes' villages will never do. But in tomorrow's opening ceremony we may also find parallels from long ago. ""It would be idle to pretend that the ceremony had any popular support,"" wrote the correspondent for the Times in 1931. ""The attendance was confined entirely to those admitted by official invitation. All the approaches to New Delhi were plastered with armed police, and little encouragement was given to anyone who desired to offer a demonstration, friendly or otherwise."" Still, the time for churlishness is over. We must forget the collapsed bridge, the excrement in the rooms and ceiling tiles on the floor – and hope for the best.",Why Delhi is still a contractors' city at heart | Ian Jack,2010-10-02T06:00:01Z,Ian Jack,world
"Should you be short of something to drink to on Sunday, why not toast what's being called the ""official"" end of the first world war? Prost, salut, and bottoms up, because tomorrow Germany will pay the final tranche of reparations imposed on it by the treaty of Versailles, bestowing such an epic sense of ""closure"" that the occasion almost demands Jeremy Kyle devote a special programme to it. ""On Sunday, the last bill is due,"" declared the German newspaper Bild this week, ""and the first world war finally, financially at least, terminates for Germany."" I do love that morose ""financially at least"", suggesting that at some unspecified level the Germans are still fighting WWI 92 years after it officially ended. Were he sane, which of course he isn't, the idea might give pause to Tony Blair, who was pettishly suggesting people should ""move on"" from Iraq a mere two years after he took that most intelligent of foreign policy decisions. Anyway, we must salute Germany for ticking ""end first world war"" off its to-do list, considering how many loose ends of human conflict remain untied. North and South Korea have never signed a ceasefire and have been technically at war since 1950, for instance, while Costa Rica only got around to making peace with Germany for the first world war at the end of the second, not having been party to the treaty of Versailles. Andorra left the same bit of business till 1958, while the Isles of Scilly were technically at war with the Dutch over some pirate shenanigans in the 17th century till 1986. And the list goes on. Amazing, isn't it, how tardy we can be ending wars, considering how precipitously we seem to rush into most of them. Perhaps it's an oversight born of the same illogical romantic optimism that finds governments always looking ahead to phantasmal future conflicts, instead of concentrating on the boring old ones other people's children are stuck fighting for them in the present. And so to this week's confirmation that David Cameron and Nicolas Sarkozy are to discuss the possibility of a shared UK-French nuclear deterrent. Yes, you might have assumed that this country's most lovingly nurtured delusion was that the French were never to be trusted, but it turns out even that sacred cow is trumped by the specious belief that we require a nuclear deterrent. Even as a steady trickle of coroners' complaints about the equipment shortages in Afghanistan continues to reach the Ministry of Defence, and while Liam Fox frets stagily about austerity cuts to his budget, it's comforting to know that £20bn will be found to renew what has been described witheringly by Air Commodore Alastair Mackie as ""our stick-on hairy chest virility symbol"". Only last week, a Times editorial blathered on about the desirability of Nato maintaining a so-called second centre of nuclear decision-making, prompting a letter from Mackie, which crisply debunked the notion that this set-up would present a nuclear-armed evildoer with a strategic dilemma. ""Not so,"" he countered. ""It would simply ensure that the opponent's opening gambit would be to obliterate the shortest side of the triangle – ourselves."" By spelling out this rudimentary piece of game theory, Mackie's argument ought to silence even those who decline to see the fatuity of prioritising Trident over body armour, when today's typical conflict will have been started by us and fought against an enemy whose arsenal of AK-47s/simple explosive devices/£1.99 boxcutters you would hesitate to deem state of the art. As Field Marshal Lord Bramall put it last year, nuclear weapons have proved ""completely useless as a deterrent to the threats and scale of violence we currently, or are likely to, face – particularly international terrorism; and the more you analyse them the more unusable they appear."" As indicated, this and similar opposition from all manner of proper military types ought to silence the Westminster willy-wavers, but won't, because in this country you get more traction fulminating about the minutiae of public spending – what is the BBC's biscuit policy? Why has some council wasted a couple of grand on the wrong sort of public loos? – than you do about the tens of billions wasted upon the world's most intellectually flawed white elephant. The only bright spot – and it still tends toward the dim – is that people do cool significantly on the latter if its cost is set out in relative terms. When a 2005 poll for Greenpeace asked: ""Do you think the government should replace its nuclear weapons or not?"", 46% of respondents said it shouldn't, 44% said it should, and 10% didn't know. However, when informed the cost of replacement was the equivalent of building 1,000 schools, 54% opposed it, and only one in three supported it. One can only hope the stark horrors of the forthcoming comprehensive spending review crystallise an even greater percentage of minds. Then again, perhaps the idea of a shared nuclear deterrent is disarmament by another name. After all, what could put a weapon further beyond use than making its deployment dependent on agreement between us and the French?",A nuclear deterrent based on agreement with the French?

"The Facebook movie has arrived – The Social Network – and with it the puzzlement that anyone can make an interesting film about computer code. (The answer is have Aaron ""West Wing"" Sorkin write the script, and make sure the movie has only one line of code, dramatically written on a window.) The central relationships in this Facebook narrative are built around the prototype of the perfect nerd, who understands the internet to its bones and can see its reach and the full spectrum of its uses. This nerd must, by definition, be uninterested in money. Mark Zuckerberg, the co-founder of Facebook, has proof of his monastic temper: long before he invented Facebook, he came up with an application, Synapse Media Player, which could guess your probable music tastes based on what you already liked. He put that out for free, despite an offer from Microsoft (he was 17!). This film's portraits of Zuckerberg and Sean Parker (originator of Napster, later joining the Facebook lot) distil the ego ideal: they have a purity of purpose stemming from intellectual enquiry, a maths-for-maths' sake agenda. Moreover, they don't have enough respect for the establishment to want to steal anything from it. Where they do threaten commerce, it's just a maverick destructiveness, to demonstrate their playful, effortless superiority. Or, as Zuckerberg once said about hacking: ""It's not about breaking and entering, it's about being unafraid to break things in order to make them better."" It's no accident that stealing on the inter-wonder is ""piracy"" rather than straight ""thieving"": it's not acquisition, more a lifestyle statement. So Facebook was hostile to advertising at the start, and understandably: this was supposed to be a revolution, and as proof of its radicalism money was irrelevant. But that being the case, how is Facebook worth such an outlandish amount of money? This is all theoretical at the moment, because the company has not gone public: when it does, it is expected to have an immediate valuation of $35bn, rising to $100bn by 2015. Is this a bubble, much like the dotcom bubble – only more foolish, preceded as it is by something just like it? Or is it based on demonstrable turnover, and what is that turnover if not good old-fashioned advertising? Well, it's almost all ads – the site has overcome its misgivings and is expected to make $1.1bn this year. Half of that is straight advertising, a little bar down the side telling you to buy stuff. There are also ""performance ads"", where the user has to vote on something, or do a little multiple choice, engage with the ad in some way – the ultimate testament, I thought, to the restless aimlessness of time spent on Facebook. But no, the ultimate testament turns out to be the virtual gifts, which accounted for one-tenth of the revenue last year, and are really beyond pointless – you spend a dollar sending your friend a picture of a cocktail, or a puppy. This made $50 million. Funnily enough, this is thought of as the most authentic way of ""monetising"" the enterprise. Facebook itself creates its own currency, which transfers back into real currency, but for the purposes of the site is untainted by big business: virtual gaming companies then buy into this virtual currency, as well as advertising on Facebook, and there is an enormous generation of commerce with a pretend-product. I suppose it's quite environmentally sound – at least no carbon was burned in its invention – but paradoxically, it is the virtual commerce, more than any of the adverts, that trashes the lofty, revolutionary vision of the site's founders. The fact that anyone would buy a non-existent farm animal says it all: inertia generates the most incomprehensible wants and needs. Who better to advertise to than people who are hugely numerous, sitting still, in a transitional period of their lives and bored to their existential core? Advertisers could have invented this constituency: and they need it now, more than ever, since as businesses become more global, ever more complex ways must be devised to discover the specificity of each market – or, more simply, who they're supposed to be selling to. If nobody operates locally, there will be things about customers that can only be discovered via Facebook's dodgy privacy settings. There's no point, in other words, of either courting or repelling advertisers. You could try to create a place where people gather and isn't immediately swarming with salespeople, but you would fail. People congregate because they're looking for distraction; those people are the lifeblood of consumerism; the congregation gets bombarded; and one day it tires of the bombardment and dissipates. People always talk about Facebook vanquishing MySpace, but these sites aren't winning or losing, they're all just following this same trajectory. The only alternative would be if you managed to create a place in which people congregated not to be distracted, but to concentrate, preferably – probably necessarily – on the same thing. That would be true revolution, and it would look a lot like church. It makes me think: maybe there's less power in Facebook, and more in religion, than their respective growth charts would suggest.",These perfect Facebook nerds did start a revolution – in advertising | Zoe Williams,2010-09-30T07:00:03Z,Zoe Williams,world
"He knew the obituary writers were sharpening their pencils and he was determined to deny them. ""I'm not dead, I'm still here,"" David Miliband told a succession of big-time political interviewers. Give us a wave, asked the photographers gathered outside his London home, but he refused. He knew their tricks – they once persuaded him to hold up his breakfast banana, providing just the twittish snap they wanted – and so he refused: he would not give them an image of farewell. No, he insisted, he was not quitting frontline politics. On the contrary, he wanted to ""recharge my political and intellectual batteries to be of greater service to the party and the country"". This was not so much an exit as a break – one that might even last just two years, when there will be another round of elections for Labour's shadow cabinet. He says he plans to use the time to contemplate the great issues of the future but he, and those around him, will inevitably take stock of the past – and of a career defined in two extraordinary ways. The first is that, politically speaking, David Miliband grew up in public. It wasn't just that he mingled with public figures as a boy, raised as the son of the great Marxist scholar Ralph Miliband in a home that served as a salon for the luminaries of the left – so that the likes of Tony Benn and Tariq Ali had memories of him in short trousers. It was that he started at the highest level, improbably early. He was still in his 20s when he headed Tony Blair's policy unit, first in opposition, then in government. Alastair Campbell called the bespectacled resident genius ""Brains"" after the Thunderbirds puppet. What followed was a nine-year metamorphosis, from uber-geek to international statesman and potential prime minister, played out in full public view. From his entry into parliament in 2001, via a job as schools minister a year later, he began a rapid ascent from backroom boy to front-of-house talent. The nerdiest edges were smoothed off as cabinet promotions followed – first in charge of local government, then environment – until by 2007, six years after he had been churning out policy papers in No 10, he emerged as the man most likely to challenge Gordon Brown for the Blair succession. He decided against it – a move some of his supporters now regret. The most visible stage of this evolution came with the job he received from Brown as reward for his restraint. As foreign secretary, David Miliband suddenly cut a very different figure. The round glasses were long gone, the suits became sharper. He now strutted the world stage. Hillary Clinton took a shine to her younger counterpart, gushingly describing him as ""vibrant, attractive, vital"". By the time of the election defeat this year, many Labour MPs – exhausted after seeing Brown struggle in the role of prime minister – were convinced that David Miliband looked the part. Miliband himself came to believe that too, supremely confident to the very end. When he and his fellow leadership contenders were shown around the Manchester conference hall on Saturday, before any of them knew the result, the older Miliband complained about the size and location of the rostrum on the stage: he wanted it to be just right for the winner's speech he expected to give that afternoon. So what went wrong? The answer might lie in the second, extraordinary aspect of the senior Miliband career: that someone defined as the representative of the Blairite right had a record that could just as easily have pointed in the opposite direction. This was, after all, a man who began his career working for John Smith's Commission on Social Justice. Blair admits in his autobiography that he appointed David Miliband in 1994 despite suspecting his young aide harboured rather old Labour instincts. In Blair's first term, Miliband was known as the social democrat in No 10, determined to devise a ""red thread"" that might run through New Labour policy. Perhaps more strikingly still – given that he has ended up as the poster boy for the Iraq war – David Miliband can claim to have been one of the very first people anywhere to have sounded the alarm over the threat posed by the foreign policy of George W Bush. In January 2001, just days after Bush's inauguration, Miliband was privately telling friends he feared the neoconservatives around Bush were ""crazy"". In the lead-up to the Iraq war, it was Miliband – then a humble schools minister – who privately raised grave doubts and concerns about the case for invasion. Yet anyone watching this summer's leadership campaign would have assumed David Miliband had been foreign secretary at the time, if not the very architect of the war. Somehow he let the worst excesses of New Labour, from Iraq to privatisation, become the frame around him. Not vividly enough did he point out that he was one of the few Labour figures to stand up to Blair on foreign policy, challenging in cabinet the prime minister's policy on Israel's offensive against Lebanon in 2006. Instead, Miliband let both friends and opponents brand him as the keeper of the Blairite flame. In Manchester this week his most senior colleagues scratched their heads as they tried to explain it. Had he become a prisoner of his supporters, especially Lord Mandelson and Blair himself, as they ensured he stayed in line? Others wonder if the key factor was the presence of his brother. Once Ed Miliband began distancing himself from New Labour – ""pandering"", as most Davidites see it – David felt compelled to do the opposite. Once Ed had grabbed the mantle of ""change"", David was stuck with ""continuity"". There are two other theories, each related to the other. The first suggests that David Miliband may just have an excess of that rare commodity among politicians: integrity. He simply felt it would be dishonest to criticise the government he had served or to cast himself as some kind of dissident – even though he would have had plenty of evidence on his side. The notion of trashing the men who had been his mentors seemed dishonourable. If that sounds unwisely high-minded for a politician, then there are several senior Labourites who would agree. Some of his admirers despair that David Miliband refused to play the political game, failing to make even a few token leftward gestures that would have won him support. More basic still, once it became clear that the second preferences of Ed Balls voters would settle the leadership, Ed Miliband promptly asked Balls to urge his supporters to put the younger Miliband's name second. To the Balls camp's amazement, David never even asked. Such things make the Davidites curse, along with his occasionally tetchy manner on television or a tendency to talk at, rather than to, some of his parliamentary colleagues.

"Aren't people who prefer to give Rupert Murdoch the benefit of the doubt adorably trusting? At the precise moment his Fox News appears to have finally abandoned even the quarter-arsed pretence of impartiality, allowing Tea Party-backed candidates to fundraise on air in return for exclusive, uncritical access, there are those on these shores opining that Murdoch winning full control of BSkyB really is no biggie. Well, quite. What's the worst that can happen? Even as Sarah Palin appears to be fashioning a run at the presidency without appearing on any media outlet other than the one that pays her (she has her own show on Fox), there are those wittering that Murdoch basically already runs Sky, so gaining full control won't alter the UK's media landscape. Were things across the Atlantic not looking so mind-boggling, you could almost envy that cosy, antiquated assumption that the ""media landscape"" is something settled, as opposed to in a state of historic flux. Sarah Palin's tweets may have to be ghostwritten – I know, even Darren Bent can fart out his own – yet, as Time magazine observed this week, a single one of them can dominate a news cycle, while one of her speeches can monopolise three news cycles. The fact that Palin is the figurehead of a movement most of whose emergent stars would appear to be better suited to prison or lunatic asylums makes it hard to get one's head around quite what is happening to mainstream politics in the US at the moment. But for people who'd ideally like prospective leaders of the free world to be able to point to China on a map – and not to claim that they'd have told the Nazis Anne Frank was hiding in their attic because lying is always wrong in God's eyes – it doesn't feel madly encouraging. When candidates for public office are being promoted by Fox on the apparent understanding that they will appear exclusively on Fox, classing the network a fascist broadcaster seems less and less hysterical. Indeed, things have come to such a pretty pass that earlier this year even Matthew Freud, Murdoch's son-in-law, felt moved to tell a reporter he was ""ashamed and sickened"" by Fox News. Poor dear. Yet while Matthew might be a useful valet when Rupert wants someone to organise a private jet to spirit David Cameron to his holiday yacht for drinks, his views on this ever-more powerful force in US politics are of as much concern to Murdoch as those of Kerry Katona. Indeed, only a couple of months previously Rupert had gone on the record to defend Glenn Beck's comments that Barack Obama is a racist, declaring: ""He was right."" Happily, the real players in the family are able to see the bigger picture, which is why James Murdoch last year described the BBC's activities and ambitions as ""chilling"" – high praise indeed from a chap whose dad owns 40% of the UK newspaper market and enjoys a satellite monopoly gifted to him by an obsequious Margaret Thatcher. Happier still, that obsequiousness endures. Within days of the coalition government being formed, it emerged that one of the prime minister's first meetings was with the News Corp overlord himself. According to one account, Murdoch was ""ushered up the back stairs of Downing Street"" – which sounds like both a statement of fact and a euphemism for what Rupert has been doing to successive governments for decades. Yet still there are those who regard this abusive relationship as totally normal. Arguably their most baffling cry is that Murdoch ""isn't political"" because he has supported both Tory and Labour in the past, a piece of spectacularly muddled thinking summed up this week by one commentator who reckoned the BSkyB deal should go through because ""Murdoch has no real politics beyond what's good for Murdoch"". It is a mark of how deeply some have drunk from the Kool-Aid that Rupert-über-alles doesn't count as a political position – when history, and many a weighty political memoir, shows it has meant the only policies recent UK governments can feel comfortable implementing are those that suit Murdoch's business agenda. From Thatcher through Blair to Cameron, our democratically elected leaders have tugged their forelocks to an unelected foreign tax exile in gibbering fear of losing his papers' support, allowing Murdoch to regard a change of government as the mere shuffling of junior personnel. Currently serving as his host organism is David Cameron, who clearly has no intention of resisting, which means it's down to Vince Cable. If his speech this week meant anything, the business secretary must block the deal to protect the media plurality essential to democracy. Writing last Sunday in support of such a block, David Puttnam revived a warning of Lord McNally's from only a few years ago. ""In the 1930s,"" his lordship had reminded parliament, ""we were afraid that the fascists would take over the government and then control the press; in the 21st century, there may be a danger that the fascists will take control of the press and then control the government. The dangers are there."" Indeed they are, as an increasingly rampant Fox News foreshadows. marina.hyde@theguardian.com",Rupert-über-alles must not be allowed to darken BSkyB | Marina Hyde,2010-09-24T20:00:49Z,Marina Hyde,world
"Sir Nicholas Wall, England's most senior family court judge, said on Monday that intelligent couples made divorce more painful, and also that ""often the mother, who finds herself caring for the children, is able to use her power over them to deny the father contact"". It's a little bit rich, this, since it fails to take into account the practical reality that the person who is caring for the children probably doesn't have as much money as the person who is working, so ends up using different leverage. Sure, it's not brilliant parenting to take your children as hostages in a sour squabble, but there's economics underneath that, not a predisposition of gender. The more contentious idea is this: ""As a rule of thumb my experience is that the more intelligent the parent, the more intractable the dispute"". I suspect a conflation, here, of ""intelligent"" and ""loaded"": a couple determined to chase a court settlement for their divorce might be quoted between £15,000 and £20,000 by a cheap solicitor, £30,000 to £50,000 by an expensive one. But that is a straightforward divorce: a strikingly ""intractable"" dispute would run to six or eight or even 10 applications to court over a number of years, and then you would be talking about £100,000, or even more. Even to be able to put your hands on the lowest estimate, ""middle-class"" wouldn't quite do it; you'd also have to be wealthy. Liz Edwards, vice-chair of Resolution (a collection of family lawyers who also train and accredit mediators), counters that divorcing couples do borrow from their parents, remortgage and even sell their houses to fight these cases: ""I have had clients with all sorts of levels of wealth."" But to fight one of these protracted, bitter contests, you would have to be brimming with cash. And that's probably a good thing, even if unintentional (one supposes it wasn't with the aim of deterring litigants that the court process became so eye-poppingly expensive). The family courts are an incredibly bad tool for the job of divorcing, and should only be used as an extreme: making it extremely expensive is not a bad way of enforcing that. The intractable super-rich would demonstrate more intelligence if they realised that their strung-out divorces were really no different to anybody else's, and all that was distinguishing them was a lack of financial restraint. Nevertheless, as Ruth Cain, lecturer in law at the University of Kent points out: ""Sir Wall says, explicitly, that separating is a failure of parenting. So he's making a tacit point that the middle classes shouldn't split up in the first place. It's unrealistic, it stigmatises divorcing couples, single parents, and mothers."" And that's fine – judges being, since the dawn of due process, known for the occasional eruption of conservative opinion. But what is not fine is the fact that a lot of this obstinacy, so damaging to families and so scarring to the lives of children, is not so much signified by the fact that the couple has ended up in court as created by the court process. It's adversarial, which we all accept, and I imagine might be quite intellectually thrilling if you're a corporate behemoth arguing property law against your peer. In the context of a divorcing couple, however, it simply involves listing negative things about the other person in the hope of scoring more points with your assassination than they score in their assassination of you. Such a performance could almost have been designed to extinguish the possibility of agreement. It is not uncommon at all for parties to make huge, poisonous claims against each other which turn out to be unfounded. Cain says briskly: ""The men always claim that the women are insane, the women always claim that the men are abusers."" If this were simple rancour, you could be forgiven for throwing up your hands and simply saying they're all mad – any couple who can't negotiate and ends up in court is mad by definition. But the process is more subtle, as Edwards explains: ""When you're together you accept that certain things are happening, and you can counterbalance them, and you make them work in the best way you can. When you're apart, you really go for it. By the time you've said it three times, and a lawyer's reacted, and a Cafcass officer has reacted, and a judge has reacted, you really think there's an enormous danger to your child."" Many family lawyers recognise this, of course: Resolution's stated belief is that any case that ends up in court is a failure, not just of the parents, but also of their respective solicitors. They run courses to avert acrimony that they hope, in the long term, will become as routinely sought as an antenatal class. For that message – keep out of court – to really come across, it might be even more helpful for a senior judge to say it. Judges love to fix on one or other class, one or other gender, and blame them for their failure to take responsibility. They should take responsibility themselves, by issuing less of this stern chiding, more in the way of public warning: courts will ruin you, they will take your divisions, expose them, magnify them and ignite them. You will most likely never claw your way back to a civilised relationship afterwards. And it's not even a conspiracy to make money (although they do, also, make money). It's the way they were designed.","It's wealth, not brains, that makes divorce so poisonous | Zoe Williams",2010-09-23T06:30:34Z,Zoe Williams,uk
"The movie Made in Dagenham is billed as feelgood. It is, for laughter is never far away. This more -or-less faithful account of how 187 women machinists at Ford Dagenham take on the company in the summer of 1968 for the cause of equal pay and get a result is brilliant. The attention to period detail, the characterisations and the compelling narrative of everyday, working-class life are nearly perfect – and very British. It is a film with a mission. These women are taking industrial action as trade unionists to win a great cause. I can't remember such a sympathetic account of postwar trade unionism. Maybe, I pondered as I watched, the cultural tide towards trade unions and the left is turning. The Ed Miliband bandwagon in the fight for the Labour party leadership is reflecting something in the zeitgeist. That was my first thought. But the film is also honest to the darker side of trade unionism in the late 60s – its chauvinism, conservatism, inflexibility and lack of an ideology that made any sense beyond its own confines. Then those attitudes could not prevent trade unions being a force in the land. Britain employed nearly 10 million men and women in largely unionised manufacturing industry. The gap between the ambitions of socialist ideology and the reality of making compromises with capitalism did not matter. Everybody had to be pragmatic according to their own position, making ritual obeisance to an impossible ideology. That unresolved gap was to neuter the Labour party and condemn it to four lost general elections. Tony Blair had the courage to recognise that Labourite socialism, defined as controlling the commanding heights of the economy, taxation at confiscatory rates, oppositional trade unionism and furnishing universal welfare benefits as unconditional entitlements, was stone dead. The world depicted in Made in Dagenham had gone forever. Labour's problem was twofold. There was not the class base for any such socialist programme and, even if there were, it was inoperable. The party had to come to a different accommodation, both with capitalism and the state. It had to use the state to create vigorous checks and balances within capitalism rather than directly run it. The market economy had the merit of unleashing entrepreneurship and the fair rewards for hard work and effort. Fairness, a core Labour value, was a larger idea than just equality of income. It meant reciprocity, contributing, getting one's just deserts and accepting obligations, a far cry from everyone contributing according to their ability and everyone getting what they needed, whatever their effort. Fairness and belief in the market economy were thus two traditions that could be reconciled. The romantic socialism of intellectuals such as Ralph Miliband, father of David and Ed, was wrong. Blair and Brown shrank from what their analysis meant in practice. Neither attempted to reform British capitalism. Nor did they develop a workable model of what a fair welfare state or fair society could look like. They spent the unsustainable revenues from the credit boom on public services that certainly improved, genuflected to tabloid populism and made common cause with George Bush in Iraq. First the lack of any weapons of mass destruction and then the credit crunch exposed the lack of depth of the New Labour project. Politically and intellectually exhausted, the party collapsed, saved from ignominy in the general election only by the biases in the electoral system. There are two potential reactions to what has happened. One is Ed Miliband's. In his view, his father was right. The left has to be a broad intellectual, social and political movement anchoring the party in Parliament. Business and finance are essentially the enemy. The task is to revive the Labour movement to win control of the state in order to change capitalism and enfranchise an exploited working class, but in a modern guise. The other conclusion is his brother's. His father was right in his passion for justice and the equal worth of all human beings. But otherwise he was locked in the 1930s and 40s. The New Labour analysis of Ralph's brand of socialism was substantially correct. What went wrong was Brown's combination of political cowardice and subversion of Blair, so that no reform of capitalism was ever attempted. Equally, Blair was constitutionally incapable of challenging the vested interests on the right as much as the left. He was happy taking on unions and public services, but was much more hesitant about tackling monopoly and market abuse in the City, media or wider business. However, there were achievements, ranging from a transformed NHS to a much stronger science base and the minimum wage. The task is not to trash New Labour. Blair won the British left a legitimacy which is a potential political trump card; to throw it away would be folly. The job is to deepen New Labour's left of centre roots and exploit its legitimacy so that next time round it makes a better fist at delivering. David Miliband gets tagged by his critics as right wing, but his speeches tell a different story. He wants a moral economy in which British capital is less feckless and the City is reformed. He calls for a good society in which benefits and entitlements are earned, and there is more space for neighbourliness and the local. He wants to devise ways in which public intervention is less statist and more rooted in civic and social institutions. He is a measured deficit-cutter, daring to tax the middle-class sacred cow – property. Above all, as the heir to New Labour, the country beyond the left will give him a hearing. He could provide the further legitimacy to allow, for example, Ed Balls to continue his intellectual assault on the economic reasoning behind the coalition government's fiscal policy – and win the argument. Ed Miliband, if he wins, will be on the political defensive from the beginning. The right-wing press intend to make the label of "" Red Ed"" stick and he has given them enough ammunition. He will have jettisoned the legitimacy offered by New Labour. He will want to build a broad left position that is more purposeful, aggressive and encompassing than the one on offer from his brother, but there is no such position which is election winning. The world depicted by Made in Dagenham really has gone; what is left is the appeal of the values. Ralph and Ed Miliband were and are good men. But it is David, for all his sometimes opaque slogans, who offers Britain's left of centre its best shot at putting those values into practice.",David Miliband is the man best placed for leadership | Will Hutton,2010-09-18T23:07:25Z,Will Hutton,politics
"Not a good week for vegetarians. First, you had Lady Gaga attending an awards do in her meat dress. Yawn. Old. Been done, love. What to say except poor Gaga looked (ahem) offally silly. Much more seismic was Simon Fairlie's book, Meat: A Benign Extravagance, which tore apart long-accepted data on environmentally unsound meat production, prompting environmentalist George Monbiot to retract his view that the ethical way forward was veganism. According to Fairlie, it doesn't take 100,000 litres of water to produce one kilogram of beef (more like a third). It doesn't take 10 units of vegetation to produce one unit of meat (the ratio could be 2:1). And the oft-quoted 2006 UN report was flawed, he says: livestock are not responsible for more of the world's greenhouse gases than transport (the figure is closer to 10%, against transport's 18%). And so Fairlie goes on, like an unjolly green giant, trampling much-cherished eco-veggie facts and figures underfoot. Except that, leafing through my copy of his book, it is clear that Fairlie is not some mischievous eco-iconoclast – his main thrust is for major downsizing in meat production. Fair enough. It seems to me that vegetarians and vegans should be able to adjust to new information when it emerges, because it isn't always going to go our way. If some feel upset, perhaps they should take it as a sign that they shouldn't have jumped into bed with the environmental lobby so quickly and easily in the first place. The sluts. Indeed, it's time for vegetarians to ask ourselves – when did we become such pushovers, so happy for our core belief system to be turned into a side issue to the eco-line? Let's face it, we were never more compliant and grateful than when the environmental lobby came along – our knickers were coming down faster than we could say: ""Global warming."" A few months ago, I interviewed Paul McCartney about Meat Free Mondays and, not knowing what we do now, he cited the 2006 UN report about livestock emissions being greater than those caused by transport. At the time, I understood why he needed to do this: it helped get the issue out of the veggie ghetto to include the carnivores. There's nothing wrong with that. However, what this kind of thing also does, I now realise, is appease that strange breed of self-hating vegetarian, the sort who, for too long, has been using the environment as an ethical comfort blanket. That's where all those ""it's all about the planet, man"" bores come from. Genuine vegetarians mainly care about animal welfare – it's not them ruining your dinner parties with droning eco-waffle. Sling them a well-turned falafel and you won't hear a word of dissent all evening. It's the other type for whom ""mere vegetarianism"" just isn't enough. Here lies the fundamental difference in attitude. Rock-solid vegetarians rarely feel the need to embellish their views with apocalyptic pronouncements on ""planet Earth"". Indeed, while understanding why people used the environmental line, I also felt that, pushed too hard, there was a real danger of it cheapening the core premise of animal rights: that it is fundamentally immoral to treat other living things inhumanely, whatever the circumstances. That's why, for many vegans and vegetarians, the findings of Meat: A Benign Extravagance, while interesting, are ultimately a non-issue, a bit like Gaga's dress. They could even be viewed as a positive development – the reviving slap animal rights needs to stop trying to be zeitgeisty, a sidebar to other issues, and get back to its core message. Put bluntly, people like me don't care if the cows aren't farting the ozone layer into oblivion as much as was previously believed. We do care if animals are being treated cruelly as matter of routine, which they are, all over the world on a daily basis. What's benign about that? On a wider level, there seems to be a growing need for tough conversations about global food production generally and Fairlie's book could constitute a valuable new voice. However, if his findings actually stop someone being vegan or vegetarian, one can only wonder why they bothered in the first place.  Labour's leadership? I've done my bit The Labour leadership contest became particularly interesting for me when I realised I had a vote. I joined the Labour party in a fit of childish rage straight after the election, part of the post-coalition surge which, according to Harriet Harman, numbered as many as 32,000, at least a third of whom were disenchanted Liberal Democrat voters. Then I forgot I'd joined, until the leadership nominees started sending me ""personal"" letters and emails, pleading their case. Then I received a ballot form as big as my first flat, filled it in, probably all wrong, and sent it back. I know it only goes towards a third of the final outcome, but still – power, what a heady responsibility. Joking apart, could this post-coalition membership surge prove significant? If it is close between the two Milibands, it seems that many natural Labour voters would opt for David, because they think he is the most likely to regain power. For people who vote Labour, there are too many bad memories of trailing in the wilderness, with the press mocking Michael Foot's Cenotaph coat and Neil Kinnock falling over in the sea. However, natural Labour voters are not the only ones voting. What about all those new ""unnatural"" party members – the disgruntled, betrayed, former Lib Dems who also have a say? One would presume that quite a few of them would want to make a point of going for the more left-leaning Ed Miliband. If the younger Miliband does pip his brother at the post, it won't just be the unions that helped him. In a roundabout way, Nick Clegg would also have a hand in it. Don Draper you ain't, Tony, not even in a suit Tony Blair is a Mad Man, for once in a good way, appearing at book signings modelling suave suits and, some claim, channelling Don Draper. Hmm. Blair has got enough money, so what do we expect him to wear – Primark pyjamas with bunny slippers? Besides, it's only a suit. Suits are sartorial male cheating. A stylish woman has to navigate myriad garments – dresses, skirts, tops, trousers and accessories. Men such as the former prime minister wear a half-decent suit and everyone swoons. For men, true style means proving themselves in the tricky area of smart-casuals. Remember the Camp David summit with President Bush, when Blair turned up in jeans so snug they nearly triggered a nuclear alert? Now Blair is also trying a Tom Fordesque casual look – jacket, open shirt, dark denim. Result: he still can't do smart-casual. It just looks as though, in a bid to boost book sales, his bottom half has been amputated and replaced by Enrique Iglesias. To summarise: Don Draper – great-looking man in a suit; Tony Blair – suit with a man in it.

"Chris Mullin, the amiable backbencher and sometime junior minister, does not appear in the index of Tony Blair's memoir, A Journey. He is not in the index of The Third Man, Peter Mandelson's insider's tale, nor that of Alastair Campbell's The Blair Years. To the talent at the top, Mullin was simply a vote and not a very reliable one at that. How lucky for the rest of us that he is so much more, as his second volume of diaries, Decline & Fall, reveals in the same engaging, clear-sighted way as his first, A View from the Foothills. As its name suggests, this volume is a melancholy account of New Labour's third and final term in office. After the recent avalanche of words by the story's divas, Mullin's quiet, witty observations of the terminal stages of a government and an idea perform the service of a Greek chorus, a lament from the real world. Picking up where the first volume ended, the diaries start with his dismay at being pointlessly ""let go"" as Africa minister in the Foreign Office, the job he most enjoyed in government. It covers his final years in parliament, a period spent entirely on the back benches, removed from the conventional political and parliamentary power structures. He is increasingly frustrated by the futility of his day job and alarmed by the growing distance between Westminster and the real world. Yet despite his ennui, almost every entry has at least one nugget to treasure. Take the few days of the Labour conference in 2007 – the one where Gordon Brown nearly called a general election. It begins with an encounter with Campbell, during which, naturally enough, they fall to discussing diaries. Blair, it emerges, ""wants [Campbell] to stick it on Gordon a bit more"". On the next page, we find Mullin remonstrating with Tony Benn for accusing him of ""selling out"". As Mullin observes to his diary, his chance of senior office was lost by his opposition to Iraq, in contrast with Hilary Benn who voted for the war and sailed onwards and upwards. Later, taking part in an Amnesty debate on Guantánamo, Mullin reports that he lost his anti-American audience by pointing out that it was the terrorist attacks on the twin towers and Bali nightclubs that provoked, rather than the other way round. The next day he meets a London-Irish police constable, who tells him he would never have dared to join the police had it not been for Mullin's successful campaign to free the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four. Mullin's supreme virtues are an eye for the absurd and an incorruptible independence of outlook. That he is a little vain about the latter is clear from the pleasure he takes in the friendly respect of other independent spirits at Westminster, regardless of their politics. Thus this one-time leading light of the hard left hangs out with the Tory toff Nicholas Soames; and he finds his admiration of Blair diminished but not destroyed by Iraq and the ""umbilical link to the worst American president of my lifetime"", because he understands that nothing is possible without first achieving electoral success. He curses the inhumanity of immigration controls and their impact on scores of his constituents, but is clear-eyed about the way the rules are sometimes exploited. And he observes how Blair's passion for permanent revolution results in an unintended narrative of permanent failure. He is a wonderful collector of ridiculous tales: Gaddafi and his 200 female bodyguards pitching camp in the ballroom of the Abuja Hilton and paying the $200,000 bill in cash; the mysterious appearance of an entirely unachievable fifth pledge in the drugs white paper after No 10 decided to insert ""halving Afghanistan opium production"" without telling the minister concerned; or Brown failing to turn up at his own New Year's Eve party at Chequers. Mullin has already planned a third volume of diaries, to be called A Walk-on Part, which will go back to the beginning of New Labour. He also envisages making a fuller version available for serious students of the Blair phenomenon. Mullin is a modest man, but his ambition, to create an alternative record of the New Labour years, is a large one. Diaries, by definition, only ever cast a narrow beam of light. Mullin was rarely even in the same room as real power. But like all good journalists, he is always on the lookout for motive and, like the best storytellers, he lets us see for ourselves what it is. Not surprisingly, his publishers recommend Decline & Fall as a refreshing antidote to Tony Blair. It should be compulsory. It is an indispensable hangover cure for anyone who has ever been drunk on the idea of power.",Decline & Fall: Diaries 2005-2010 by Chris Mullin | Book review,2010-09-10T23:05:22Z,Anne Perkins,review
"What wealthy people do with their media empires is contentious in all western democracies. Ownership is not just a source of private profit; it is a source of public power, a means to shape the world to suit one's interests. Politicians court editors and proprietors for the very good reason that they can deliver votes and move opinion. Which is why most democracies have developed complex rules about media ownership. Britain, dumb to its importance, has the lightest of touches. We impose no nationality requirement; we do not tightly police the share of any media market held by one proprietor, nor make demands about limiting owners' power to take ownership chunks across the media domains; we do not even care much about preventing market dominance. The assumption has been that lightly applied competition law, along with self-regulation, is all that is required, with little thought for any political and cultural consequences. It is, I submit, the attitude of a declining civilisation that is losing its pride and sense of national purpose. Thus nobody turns a hair at the Independent titles, along with London's only evening newspaper, being owned by a Russian oligarch with alleged links to the former KGB. Richard Desmond, who made his fortune in pornography, can extend his media ownership from the Express titles to Channel 5 with no objection. The Barclay brothers, owners of the Telegraph titles, are domiciled in the Channel Islands. And most famously of all, Rupert Murdoch's News International (NI), already the dominant force in the British newspaper market, is emerging as the dominant actor in British television as well, courtesy of Sky, for which he is now bidding for complete control. The only other country that approaches this extraordinary attitude to the nexus of media ownership and power is Italy – with baleful results. Professor Manuel Castells, the great student of the new media age, analyses the emergence of ""infocapitalists"" who build self-reinforcing networks of business and political power by owning the production of information and knowledge. Silvio Berlusconi is the most important – the infocapitalist-cum-prime minister who shapes the law to accommodate the rise of his business empire and then shamelessly uses the consequent power to rally opinion behind his party and run slur stories on political opponents. Bien pensant opinion in Britain shakes its head, believing such blatant self-interested use of media power could not happen here. But it could and it does. NI has no less cross-media power than Berlusconi's Mediaset, and while its owner is not an active politician it has become the principal playmaker in the British political and media scene, pursuing interests from regulation to who gets to govern. This is the context in which to understand the mounting crisis faced by Andy Coulson, the prime minister's press secretary, over the potential extent of illegal mobile telephone-tapping into the voicemails of the famous while he was editor of the News of the World, the flagship Sunday tabloid of the News International stable. Today, the New York Times magazine publishes new evidence from journalists on the paper during Coulson's editorship insisting that mobile phone-tapping was extensive, as initial Scotland Yard inquiries suggested, but which NI has consistently denied. NI argues that it was confined to former royal reporter Clive Goodman, who spent some months in prison for the offence which triggered Coulson's own resignation. Last week, another reporter on the paper was suspended, again, we believe, for suspected telephone-tapping. Coulson has consistently said he knew nothing of more tapping beyond Goodman's and refuses to comment further. There is the usual criticism that, at the very least, Coulson is exposed as having poor judgment: if he didn't know about it, he should have. By inference, the same charge supposedly sticks to his boss, David Cameron. But Cameron is obliged to accept his press secretary's word, unless there is the strongest of proof otherwise. Coulson is not just good at his job, he has the advantage of having an extensive network inside NI, Britain's most powerful infocapitalist. This is the Berlusconi effect, British style. It is not a pretty sight. Even if the telephone-tapping was as isolated as NI and Coulson claim, what is on the record was conducted with astonishing impunity. Editors knew there would be little comeback. The Press Complaints Commission, whose investigation into the affair was embarrassingly and inevitably limp, constituted no threat. Moreover, NI has a large cheque book. More ominously, the New York Times has spoken to detectives at Scotland Yard who believe that the Met did not want to take its investigations any further beyond Goodman; nobody wanted to get on the wrong side of NI. While Labour in opposition is highly exercised over the affair, in government it was beyond feeble. The former home secretary Alan Johnson may now want the police investigation reopened; in office, he no more wanted to offend NI in the run-up to an election than the Met. Tessa Jowell says her phone was mysteriously tampered with 28 times. Why no action when in power? NI is ambitious to shrink the BBC, entrench Sky's power into a de facto monopoly, further to make itself the arbiter of British politics while using the profitability of its UK operation to support its global ambition. David Cameron has privately and passionately assured at least one top TV executive I know that he is not in Murdoch's pocket, but he also does not want to lose his press secretary. Nick Clegg and the Lib Dems have a golden opportunity. They should not add to the firestorm over Coulson unless he is clearly guilty, but insist as a quid pro quo upon the establishment of a media commission, along the lines of the banking commission (one of the Lib Dems' and Vincent Cable's best achievements) to examine Britain's media ownership and competition rules. A plural and diverse British media, underpinned by a strong BBC, should be at the heart of Lib Dem thinking and policy. Intriguingly, not one Labour leadership candidate has called for such a commission, nor spelled out how they would deal with infocapitalism and private media power. Clegg could show his critics that the coalition does have a liberal dimension, that he is not Cameron's stooge and contrast his stance with Labour's chronic temporising. Who will defend Britain from its Berlusconisation?

"What a shame that William Hague decided to handle the internet rumours in such a pompous, heavy-handed manner. It doesn't matter that the rumours have been following him since Oxford University: who, these days, would be so silly and thin-skinned as to be genuinely upset by a gay smear? Or so naive as to admit they are? Making the underqualified Christopher Myers his aide is one thing, but the pair sharing a hotel room could have been handled easily and lightly – Hague joking that he's a Yorkshireman, too tight to pay for two rooms. As for the ""True Bromance"" pictures of them walking along the street in sunglasses, Hague in a baseball cap and tucked-in top, Alastair Campbell observed drily: ""Most politicians are poor at casual clothes."" An understatement, but there was no real harm in the photo. It was just so hilariously camp. Dining with a friend, I was told how she'd once spotted Andy Bell, the fabulous singer from Erasure, on New York's Gay Street, wearing a bum-bag. She mentally filed it away as the campest thing she'd ever seen. ""But the Hague photo is camper!"" Crucially, neither of us thought any of this (funny photos, ill-judged room sharing) had anything to do with Hague being homosexual. Why, then, did Hague feel compelled to react in such a po-faced, dramatic way? Hague should have laughed it off. Sure, there's the whiff of gay Salem around Westminster at times. Right now, we seem to be tripping over politicians coming out or having dramas about their sexuality. However, these people are gay. Merely being accused of being gay isn't the same thing. In fact, it appears to be practically a blooding for a certain stripe of workaholic politician, part of the Westminster territory. For Hague suddenly to barge around, making public statements, dragging his wife Ffion's miscarriages into it, hints at a worrying dearth of emotional intelligence. Miscarriages are incredibly sad, but they aren't proof of a man's sexuality. Nor is having children, nor is even a 20-year marriage, as Crispin Blunt recently demonstrated. However, that's beside the point. Hague seems to be a decent man and an experienced international statesman. Why, then, would he embark on a course of action that sends out the toxic message that, if it is not actually shameful to be gay, it is an outright insult to be accused of it? This is what Hague has done and, in a way, that presumes politicians are uniquely targeted. Far from it. Even at my low level, I regularly receive missives from people asking charmingly, and sometimes not so charmingly, whether I might secretly be one for the ladies. It's inaccurate; I sometimes feel that I should be checking my desk diary in case I did black out and spend a month or so dating Ellen DeGeneres. However, it's not remotely distressing or insulting. Irrelevant? I've not been splashed all over the papers, nor whispered about for years. No, but others have. Take That's new video for ""Shame"" features Robbie Williams and Gary Barlow parodying the gay movie Brokeback Mountain, making light of the homosexual rumours that have followed the band since the start of their career. Surely if fluffy boyband members can cope with elegance and humour with this kind of thing, a foreign secretary should have breezed it. This is the point. If Hague can't cope with bromance rumours, however incessant and irritating, then how can we trust him with issues that really matter, such as Afghanistan or Iran? Arguably, all this pouting and stropping has made Hague seem a million times camper. However, none of us has any right to care a damn whether William Hague is gay or straight. What is significant, and troubling, is that our foreign secretary dealt with gay rumours markedly less maturely than a boyband.  The last word isn't always worth it The case of Californian GP Jacquelyn Kotarac is tragic. Trying to get into her on-off boyfriend's bungalow to confront him over relationship issues, Kotarac didn't realise he had slipped out of the back door to go on a business trip. She climbed on to the roof and into the chimney, getting stuck and suffocating, with her body being discovered several days later. That must have been some conversation Kotarac was determined to have and I, for one, can empathise. I've been known to go to startling lengths to have my say or get the last word. These have included the ""Follow man into street ranting"" manoeuvre, the ""Stand outside locked bathroom door, repeating yourself"" tactic and the ""Maximum embarrassment public ambush"" gambit. More recently, experts in the field have had great results with the ""And another thing"" email blitz (with text option). Men do this, too, but women are better at it. A friend once left gouge marks on a door frame, so determined was she to stand her ground and ""unburden herself"". In my youth, when I had what might be termed a lively personality, I once thought it reasonable to run beside a moving train, half-hanging on to a window, ""pointing something out"". Admittedly, this could be a fault line of mine, which some may say has contributed to me ending up in a job which could be unkindly yet accurately described as being gobby. Still, extreme as Kotarac's case was, how human was the compulsion that led to her death. ""The last word"" is one of the holy grails of relationships, oft sought, but rarely found. I'm devastated that this poor woman ended up clambering down a chimney because of her desperation to make a point, but a part of me understands. Will it be Chiles play for these cereal seducers? So GMTV is no more. Goodbye sweet, strange sofa-people and your touching interest in amusing pet photos, the health of the prostate, and five-year-olds with A-levels. From tomorrow, we have Daybreak, with main presenters Adrian Chiles and Christine Bleakley, and their much-vaunted ""chemistry"", which is telly-speak for: ""Do they fancy the pants off each other?"" Or in this case: ""Does that poor sod still fancy her?"" It's a chance to munch cornflakes and wonder if more than affection flutters in Chiles's tortured breast for Frank Lampard's girlfriend. Or not. I couldn't care less about their chemistry. Nor do I have any animosity towards Chiles or Bleakley, though one can see why some might have become irritated. What a huge smarmy luvvie fuss they made of all of this. Conjoined twins could have been successfully separated with less drama than these two, um, leaving one television channel for another. Certainly, they have played a blinder, going from quite-liked screen couple to greedy, overpaid, overrated idiots everyone hates, within just a few short months. Jonathan Ross will be furious – it took him years to achieve that.",William Hague could learn from Robbie Williams | Barbara Ellen,2010-09-04T23:07:15Z,Barbara Ellen,politics
"In January 1995, the Independent on Sunday published a front-page story disclosing how Cherie Booth made some of her barrister's income by acting for local councils against poll tax defaulters, arguing successfully in one legal review case that a penniless non-payer be returned to jail. Scorn was heaped on the paper's head, which happened to be me. I got more than a hundred letters, most of them pointing out that Booth, married to Tony Blair, had the right to a working life independent of her husband's political career, and that lawyers, as any fool knew, worked on the ""cab rank"" principle, accepting the clients that chambers put their way. I soon saw that the story had been a mistake: not in its content, which was accurate, but in its presentation. Front-page treatment suggested something scandalous. A more modest position on an inside page would have let the facts be known without dressing them up as a moral outrage. And the facts were interesting. The poll tax was among the most widely reviled pieces of legislation in British history. Riots against it had helped bring down Margaret Thatcher; and though the official Labour position was that even bad laws must be obeyed, especially by legislators (one MP, jailed for non-payment, was expelled from the Labour party), Labour politicians hadn't been slow to exploit its unpopularity. The fact that the wife of the Labour leader was helping to enforce a law that her husband's party found iniquitous – at the very least it showed how paradoxical life could be inside a high-earning, double-income Islington household. The paper had friendly relations with Blair, whom it had supported for the party leadership, and he rang before publication to ask us not to run the story. It would be unfair, he said, to his wife and her legal career. Sometimes interventions of this kind have the opposite of the intended effect and stir up a journalistic piety about suppression of the truth, as well as making the story seem more important than it actually is. Perhaps something like that happened here. At any rate, after a morning of indecision, the story went on the front page and the protests from the readership began, and probably the core readership at that: metropolitan, feminist, legal and Blairite, though the last term was hardly known then. My regret was real at the time but dwindled over the years. Booth's career prospered just as much as her husband's, with speakers' fees as well as those from her work as QC. They bought flats for their student sons and a £3.7m house in Bayswater as the home they would move into after No 10. Only when Blair left office, however, did the extent of their interest in money and what it could buy become more fully apparent, as he accepted bank directorships and consultancies and bought a country house in Buckinghamshire for £5.75m. Sometimes jointly with their children, the couple now own seven properties reported to be worth a total of £15m and are said to be looking for a holiday home in Barbados. Estimates of their joint income range upwards from £7m a year. To which Blair would say: why not? In his strange, self-loving and highly readable autobiography, he often does his candour thing, and though in Blair's hands candour has to be mistrusted as a just another literary effect, he does seem to be candid when it comes to money. He writes that he identified personally with the very wealthy. ""Did I want a nice home? Yes. Did I prefer a five-star hotel to a two-star? Yes … I never thought that enjoying life's good things led to indifference to the plight of those who couldn't. For me, the opposite was true: what I wanted for myself I also wanted for others. But I didn't feel it wrong to want it nonetheless."" This is why, as ""a public service guy at heart"", he felt more at home with entrepreneurs than Gordon Brown, ""a public service guy who, if he had chosen a different path, would have been a bigger public service guy."" But Blair was attracted by the idea of running a business and making money. ""A bit of me thought: Wouldn't that be great?"" Few people had a true inkling of this personality when it took office in 1997. In 1996, Blair published his only other book. New Britain: My Vision of a Young Country really amounted to no more than a collection of his speeches and journalism and, as he admits in A Journey, it ""carefully avoided over-promising or too much detail"". But it was the fullest guide to what New Labour intended, and to the inattentive reader this could seem the political opposite of Thatcher and John Major. Blair wrote that the Tories' promise of an ""economic miracle in which income and wealth would trickle down from the top and benefit the rest of us"" had resulted only in repossessions, inadequate pensions and ""a growing number of people at the bottom without work and often without hope, joined by a discontented, anxious class in the middle, insecure about the future"". Any speechwriter to David Cameron would be familiar with certain elements of the cure: a new kind of society based on merit, commitment and inclusion; devolution and decentralisation that made people closer to power; quangos abolished; hospital waiting lists reduced; schools freed to run their own affairs; hi-tech industries that could aspire to compete with the powerhouses of Germany and Japan and not merely ""the fledgling industries of southern China"" (how time flies). In power, Blair's government achieved some of these things, but the engine of wealth-creation remained the same – in fact, it became ever more dominant. On this point his biography is naturally much clearer than his manifesto. On taxation, he wanted to preserve the Thatcher/Howe/Lawson legacy. ""I wanted wealthy people to feel at home and welcomed in the UK so that they … could spread some of that wealth about."" Or allow it to trickle down. All kinds of people got him wrong. During the 1997 campaign, Joe Klein, writing in the New Yorker, described him as Britain's first post-imperial prime minister; and yet in Manchester a week before the election Blair told an audience in Manchester, ""We are a leader of nations or we are nothing. That has been Britain's destiny for centuries and must be again."" (And, as we now know, meant it.) Another, mainly Tory version of him was as an affable Trojan horse out of which the left would pour. The most popular view, however, was of a politician who believed in nothing very much at all other than winning power. A ""magisterial vacuity"" as Klein put it. Blair was well aware this opinion was held particularly by his then closest colleague. ""The root of the problem [with Brown] was that he thought I could be an empty vessel into which the liquid that was poured was manufactured and processed by him. I was never totally sure, and still am not, whether he really did buy the illusion."" Reading his account, I remembered the story about his wife and her poll tax cases. If it were a paradox at all, it must have been one of the smaller ones that lived in their house. The community charge, to give its proper name, was dreamt up by the Adam Smith Institute and Thatcher grew obsessively attached to it. Many people saw it as the apotheosis of Thatcherism – regressive, bearing down more heavily on the poor than the rich. But was that ""ism"" so unpopular among the Blairs? Little in his book suggests so. Rather, it seems to have been the iron in the soul.",The good life according to Tony Blair | Ian Jack,2010-09-04T06:00:52Z,Ian Jack,politics
"Is Nick Clegg a hedgehog? Or is he a fox? It may not seem the obvious question, amid wild rumours of defections and dissent. Yet if the technically most successful but somehow least-loved Liberal Democrat leader of his generation is to avoid becoming political roadkill, philosophy matters. The question is getting the game plan right. Hedgehogs, as seen by the political philosopher Isaiah Berlin, are defined by a single big idea and they see the world almost entirely through this one prism. From Plato to Freud, they tend to be reformers, iconoclasts, systemisers. Frank Field, Paddy Ashdown and Margaret Thatcher are hedgehogs, as is Iain Duncan Smith now (although he wasn't as a party leader). So are many leading tycoons and most political pundits. They're inspirational and often very successful, but because they ignore counterarguments, they are prone to big mistakes. A hedgehog might theoretically let someone such as Charles Kennedy walk away from the party (despite denials on both sides of any defection to Labour) because a hedgehog might be hellbent on one grand project: a gradual merger with the right, causing a grand sweeping realignment of British politics that permanently excludes the left. Foxes sniff the wind: they draw on many different ideas, weigh competing arguments carefully, float free. Their diffuse, nuanced messages are hard to distil into soundbites, so they can seem fuzzy, but history often vindicates their caution about being pinned down. Robin Cook was a fox; Tony Blair governed initially as a fox, before turning hedgehog on foreign policy. Cameron has fox tendencies, particularly when talking about the big society. And Nick Clegg is decidedly vulpine. The distinction helps illuminate his approach to this autumn's two big dilemmas: what exactly he gains from a coalition with the potential to poison him and how to navigate its end. To survive the palpable anger over his collaboration with the right, Clegg must show Britain is a more liberal country by the end than it would otherwise have been. Damage limitation is not enough, which means defining clear ambitions for 2015 now and working backwards. The exit strategy is a more delicate affair. The critical difference between coalition and marriage is that lovers wed dreaming of forever; politicians often collaborate with one eye on the day they'll bail out, knowing that come the election all bets are off. If this were a marriage, it would be a wary second one: an unblended stepfamily, with wayward children and complicated loyalties. The Lib Dems need somehow to keep their options open, as a strategy paper prepared by the Lib Dems' federal executive for debate at next month's party conference in Liverpool shows. Despite the promised referendum on electoral reform, the paper predicts a traditional two-party slugfest between Labour and the Conservatives at the 2015 election with both trying to squeeze the smaller party out. None the less, it argues Labour may snuggle back up to them as the election approaches, asking how the party might ""manage that journey and our relationship to it"". For a newlywed, that seems decidedly flirtatious. Quietly, there is talk of mending fences with Labour. Norman Lamb, the leader's chief parliamentary adviser, will address a key fringe meeting in Liverpool on the future of LibLabbery. MPs have been briefed on a five-year strategy that positions them for the next election as independent, prepared to work for liberal ends with whichever is the largest party. Options for working with pro-AV Labour politicians on next spring's referendum are being explored. And Clegg has deliberately avoided retaliating under intense provocation from the Labour leadership contenders; his appointing Alan Milburn to advise on social mobility was an olive branch of sorts, despite Labour's hostile response. Friends stress there was nothing personal about declining coalition with Labour – it was all about the best deal. Labour's mistake was in thinking that emotional ties between the two sides mattered more than their offer. Clegg may be wise to hedge his bets. A rigid view of the future can be a serious weakness in politics. It helps explain why almost every war we have fought from the Falklands onwards was largely unforeseen by defence planners. It is why Margaret Thatcher failed to plan properly for her succession and why Tony Blair was determined not to make the same mistake but did. The Brown government's failure to see coalition coming or understand Clegg's approach to it proved similarly deadly. Yet amid the daily grind of government, it's hard to be constantly scanning the horizon. Small parties struggle to keep up with the sheer pace of events – one reason the controversial appointment of Topshop owner Philip Green to review public spending was not red-flagged – while Lib Dem ministers complain of becoming isolated from each other by departmental constraints. The routine of government acts to build links across the parties, not within them. They should make more time to talk. The dramas of coalition have obscured a fundamental question: why did Cleggmania collapse like a souffle before polling day? An analysis published by the British Election Study suggests the ""yellow surge"" was in some ways shallow. Voters liked Nick Clegg, but were less certain about his party. The Lib Dems did not win on the biggest arguments, remaining strong on issues such as the environment, which do not swing elections. Clegg may be right that were it not in coalition, the party would be doing worse with voters, although more at ease with itself. The leadership's threefold strategy to tackle these structural weaknesses has had its first major test run. The first task is to show the Lib Dems making an impact on issues such as equality. So far, the results have been mixed. A photo opportunity in a children's centre that later turned out to be threatened with closure unwittingly illustrated the party's great fear – becoming a hapless human shield for cuts. The second task is to establish credibility, by proving its ministers can govern well. And the third is forging a distinctive liberal identity within the coalition, mastering the difficult art of being separate, yet united; different, not disloyal. Clegg seeks to deliver on traditional Lib Dem touchstones such as civil liberties without becoming ghettoised in issues that matter hugely to a minority but don't resonate widely. One model is Jim Wallace, who, in coalition with Labour in Scotland, clearly ""owned"" tangible changes such as scrapping tuition fees. It's perhaps no accident that Clegg is backing a graduate tax. He needs a popular win. Lib Dem approval ratings have plummeted, with Labour gleefully welcoming defecting members. Yet Cameron rides surprisingly high for a man threatening to shed thousands of public sector jobs. The imbalance undermines morale all round, with the Tory right suspicious of what concessions Cameron might offer a beleaguered partner to keep him sweet. It's not hard to see why Clegg is taking more flak – the coalition is tacking mostly rightwards on the biggest issue, the economy, which cheers Tory supporters and dismays Lib Dems.. The intriguing question is whether after taking the early pain, Clegg may miss out on the eventual credit if the chancellor's great economic gamble succeeds. Given Liberal Democrats opposed the strategy until recently, if it works, that might be seen primarily as a Conservative miracle. Amid these challenges, it's easier to see why Clegg might suggest winning a referendum on AV is not the be all and end all. His pledge not to collapse the coalition if he lost it was partly stating the obvious; saying otherwise would sound petulant and counterproductive. But it's also a refusal to be defined by one idea. Besides, aides increasingly think merely being in coalition benefits the party. Its support traditionally slumps whenever fears about hung parliaments are invoked; showing that coalition isn't dysfunctional could theoretically remove an obstacle to voting Lib Dem. There will be pressure this autumn to bind Clegg more tightly to a party from which he sometimes seems impatiently detached. Yet that may be difficult while so many big questions remain unanswered, both about the economy and the future inclination of the Labour party. Its leadership contest has seen much swagger but little analysis about the Lib Dems, with Ed Miliband threatening to render the party extinct while his brother David dubs Clegg a ""dumb waiter"" in a dumber administration. Both are playing to the gallery now. Yet if the door to a future alliance remains ajar, Labour may take some persuading to walk through. Perhaps much depends on whether its own next leader is a prickly hedgehog – or another flexible fox.",Nick Clegg must be fox-like to avoid ending up as political roadkill | Gaby Hinsliff,2010-08-21T23:06:56Z,Gaby Hinsliff,politics
"When you think of the downsides to success (not least, for pretty sixth-form girls getting good A-level results, having to leap around for newspaper photographers), it's surprising failure gets such a bad press. Nobody wants to stigmatise those hotfooting it to Oxford with six A*s: doubtless they did the best they could. It's just a shame they're missing out both on what JK Rowling has called the fringe benefits of failure, which she described as a feeling of inner security – who are you to argue that might actually stem from her subsequent multimillion pound success? – and on the feeling of really moving with the times. Of course it's possible that knocking the stuffing out of our public services will be the making of them, freeing our armed forces or universities to become worldbeaters by removing the dreadful burden of proper funding. But you wouldn't bet the farm on it, which makes it prudent to adjust national expectations of world domination. We are only a puny island race after all, weak from lack of sunshine: the main reason we've previously triumphed at cricket and world wars is probably that we largely invented them. Now everyone else has had a chance to practise, success is getting elusive – so why not corner the market in flamboyant international failure? That's if we can get in before the French, whose World Cup team were clearly testing the water. At least we're ahead of the curve politically. Did anything in public life become the latest short-lived leader of the UK Independence party so much as his leaving of it, admitting that he was no good at politics? Lord Pearson's refreshing honesty is just what's needed come the new world order. Steven ""I'd boo the England team if I was you"" Gerrard is also on message, while some of our greatest cultural exports already do very well out of failure – from Hugh Grant (plays romantic leads who can't talk to women) to Tracey Emin (bases her work on bad relationships). Admittedly the zeitgeist hasn't reached Gordon Brown, who responded to electoral disaster mostly by insisting that it's fine being a backbencher. Someone needs to sit him in front of What Trinny and Susannah Did Next: the former makeover queens' spoof fly-on-the-wall documentary, satirising their own shameless scrabble to get back on air after their show was axed. It is a model of how to exploit your setbacks. For while the script is fiction, the underlying premise is true: the pair's original idea for a spoof was rebuffed by TV networks, hence they're defiantly broadcasting it online instead. As the saying goes, if life hands you lemons, make a miniseries out of them – something former home secretary Alan Johnson has also grasped, responding to defeat with a radio gig about his previous career as a failed musician. The difficulty, of course, in selling ourselves as one big slapstick comedy is that failure can be tragic as well as comic. When governments err, the consequences are anything but funny: for individuals, the pain of a collapsed marriage or business runs deep. Yet it's comforting to recognise that failure is not as binary as it feels. Rare is the true fork in the road, where one path leads only to happiness and the other only to doom: there's often a chance to double back. As George Bush once told graduates of his old university: ""To those of you who received honours, awards and distinctions, I say well done. And to the C students, I say you too can be president of the United States."" Failure can, as Rowling argued, strip one to the bare essentials and reveal what matters: it can be a wakeup call, a lesson in what not to do, a nudge on to a more suitable path. But it's rarely a life sentence. So for all those students opening envelopes in the coming days and not finding what they wanted: explore all your options, then try to see failure as an investment in future happiness. Why do authors frame rejection slips, and tycoons their despairing school reports? Because when success finally arrives, it tastes sweeter for remembering those who failed to see it coming. In praise of plain speaking When is a bagel more than just a bagel? When it's a revolt against corporate America. Lynne Rosenthal, a sixtysomething New Yorker, was allegedly ejected from a Manhattan Starbucks last week after refusing to order hers in approved coffee shop terms. She declined to add ""no butter, no cheese"" when ordering her multigrain bagel, arguing that we shouldn't have to list all the things we don't want instead of just the thing we do. For good measure, Rosenthal won't say ""tall"" or ""venti"" or any other euphemism designed to disguise the fact you're paying over £2 for a mug of mostly hot milk. Not that she was complaining about profit margins. Rosenthal is an English professor, and as she told the New York Post: ""Linguistically, it's stupid and I am a stickler for correct English."" The point of language is to reveal meaning, not obscure it. Admittedly Rosenthal is also accused of shouting ""asshole"" at the barista, something one can't imagine Lynne Truss doing. Still, it's hard not to cheer her semantic standards – while remembering that this side of the pond, a little confrontation goes a long way. Perhaps the ideal compromise for anyone who chokes on the words ""half-caf skinny strong soy"" is this: order your venti obediently, but in the inaudible mumble of a teenager buying condoms, forcing the confused barista to ask several times what you said. Every wasted second costs the boss-class money, after all.

"Can it really only be only three months since David Cameron and Nick Clegg gave that wisecracking joint press conference in the Downing Street garden, catapulting their take on bromance into the mainstream electoral landscape? ""Prime minister,"" inquired a reporter that day. ""Do you now regret that when once asked what your favourite joke was, you replied 'Nick Clegg'?"" ""You said that?"" Nick queried. ""I'm afraid I did once,"" played up David. ""I'm off,"" Nick deadpanned, pretending to stalk away. ""Come back!"" bleated David stagily. Mmm. Half close your eyes and you could have been watching one of the great buddy movies. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Road to Morocco. Tango & Cash. Earlier, as they passed over the threshold of No 10 together, Cameron had put his hand on Clegg's back with an amusingly proprietorial air, only for Clegg to deploy the move right back at him, before glancing round to check the photographers had caught the moment. It was all adorably reminiscent of the scene near the end of Top Gun, where Maverick and Iceman have just won world war III somewhere over the Pacific, and their previous animosity has graduated into a near-flirtatious camaraderie. ""You can be my wingman any time,"" smiles Ice. ""Bullshit,"" grins Maverick. ""You can be mine."" Alas, poor Cleggeron (the PM and his deputy were duly bestowed with their own Brangelina-style joint handle). It would not be long before alternative movie comparisons were being made. In the dog days of July that archetypal metrosexual Tory David Davis was in a Southwark bar called the Boot and Flogger – well of course he was – where he was overheard describing Cameron and Clegg's relationship as the ""Brokeback Coalition"". Primarily, given that Davis was apparently repeating a Lord Ashcroft line, the vignette functioned as a reminder that some senior Tories still operate on a wit setting one notch up from honking ""THEY R GAYLORDS LOL!@!!%!"" But if even the terminally artless wing of the Conservative party are now viewing the coalition through the prism of Hollywood movies, the rest of us will be miles ahead. We can see that what we are dealing with is a malfunctioning buddy movie. Like it or not, polls indicate Cameron has improved in stature, while Clegg – the breakout star of the election – has failed to grow into his role after playing that impossible hand to parlay his party into government. It's a bit like in Star Wars, when Han Solo ends up stealing the movie off that nebbish Luke Skywalker, despite George Lucas clearly not having meant him to. No one could deny Clegg has made obvious attempts to carve out a niche for himself in the set-up. For a while, he seemed to be affecting the pose of the crazy one in a buddy cop film. This guy literally doesn't care! He's going to stand at the dispatch box and pin an illegal war on Jack Straw's ass! Unfortunately, while these kinds of unconventional methods work well for Mel Gibson in Lethal Weapon, in Nick's line of work they required the scrambling of civil servants to explain he was speaking in a personal capacity, with Downing Street declaring tightly: ""These are long-held views of the deputy prime minister."" Which is Whitehall for: ""Goddammit, Clegg! I am sick of defending your screwball antics to the commissioner! You're on traffic duty!"" Ultimately, though, Clegg's apparent maverick strategy has failed because Cameron has doubled down on him in the brash young hothead role. Pakistan? Two-faced exporters of terror, according to the PM. Britain? Junior partner to the United States in the fight against Jerry, even before they'd entered it. Gaza? A prison camp. Iran? Packing a nuclear weapon. Who's Axel Foley now, Nick? Perhaps most excruciating was Clegg's outing in Nick Robinson's documentary about the making of the coalition – a behind-the-music look at events of 37 minutes ago (I paraphrase slightly). As Clegg sloppily revealed he'd tricked Cameron into misleading his own backbenchers, one could only imagine a bemused Hollywood producer demanding: ""Wait – why are people supposed to root for this guy?"" If he ever started out as the Sundance Kid, Clegg has ended up the unintentionally irksome comedy sidekick – the coalition's Jar Jar Binks. The most recent YouGov poll placed Lib Dem support at 12%, while this week Clegg failed to pull off insouciance as he blustered: ""I'm not acting prime minister … I'm holding the fort for a couple of weeks."" An antsy distinction which somehow contrives to place the stewardship of this country at the level of Gareth Keenan's ill-disguised anxieties about his role in The Office. He likes to think of himself as ""assistant regional manager""; the actual boss regards him as ""assistant TO the regional manager"". But what of Downing Street's regional manager? Well, with that same poll placing support for his party at 42%, he won't just be feeling slightly more relaxed as we move into the next reel. He'll be convinced he can carry a movie on his own.",First 100 days: David Cameron and Nick Clegg lose buddy movie script,2010-08-18T07:45:21Z,Marina Hyde,politics
"The saddest sight this week has been of America's first family taking a quick one-day holiday in Florida. Crashing visitor numbers and plummeting fish sales have devastated the Gulf of Mexico after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. There is talk of an 80% drop in revenues in some resorts. Yet figures show just 16 of the state's 180 holiday beaches are at all polluted, while the bulk of the spill appears to have dispersed, or be dispersing out at sea. Having hyped the disaster for political purposes, the president is now frantically trying to play it down. The spill has been another classic of state terror in which incident and response are wholly out of proportion to one another. As the oil leak began back in April, Obama declared a disaster, banned fishing in 37% of the Gulf and ordered a halt to underwater oil exploration, putting some 27,000 jobs at risk. Columnists screamed it was ""Obama's 9/11"" and demanded he ""harness the nation's outrage"". He was attacked for playing golf within 58 days of the disaster. With dial-a-quote scientists howling blue murder, any who might have looked at previous spills and thought it might not be so bad would have been unpatriotic disaster-deniers. Hardly a day passed without the president castigating BP, the hated ""British Petroleum"" – never its American site operators, Transocean and Halliburton, or his own regulators. It was a field day for xenophobes. The president used the sort of language normally visited on global terrorists. He was going to ""get BP"" and make them ""pay for this"". It was another Hurricane Katrina, but one that could thankfully be blamed on foreigners. A Louisiana seafood supplier declared: ""If I had a bomb, I would put it on London"" – which would have him in Guantánamo Bay if he were Muslim and speaking of New York. Foreigners had raped America. It was they, they, they … Now, mysteriously, Obama speaks of we, we, we … who ""have this thing under control"". His environment adviser, Carol Browner, says ""the vast majority of the oil appears to have gone"". Less than 10% of coastline saw any oil at all. There have been no sightings of dead fish floating in the sea and most fishing will soon be ""back to normal"". The Gulf is apparently ""clean, safe and open for business"", and a lovely place to take the kids. It is OK, everyone. Disaster has turned to triumph, so let us all think about the midterm elections. So whose fault really was the collapse in the local economy? It began with a failed oil well, responsibility resting with BP, but blame still not apportioned. Yet as every terrorist knows, it is not the bomb that does the real damage, it is the publicity multiplier given it by the media and politics. The bomb causes the bang; the target is then relied on to supply the megaphone. So it has proved in the Gulf. Competing scientists have had a field day. While some kept up the hysteria this week with such declarations as ""We don't know the long term yet"", those with links to the administration or fishing for BP's $500m offered to Gulf environmental research are suddenly optimists. Most of the oil has mysteriously evaporated, like that from the biggest similar disaster, the dumping of oil into the Persian Gulf in 1991 by Iraqi forces. America did not turn a hair, any more than it did about the Union Carbide explosion that killed 15,000 Indians in Bhopal in 1984, with only trivial compensation paid. The issue is apparently no longer the number of ""barrels"" spilled but the sort of oil, the location of the spill and the temperature of the ambient water and air. Contamination of most wildlife appears to have been minimal. Even crustaceans recover fast, while the ban on fishing has boosted fish stocks. What we have here is yet another fiasco in the public management of disaster, which is becoming a global pandemic all of its own. From oil spills to Icelandic ash clouds, from flu viruses to ""Frankenstein cows"", from Afghanistan's ""terror threat to our streets"", which has already killed more than 300 British servicemen, to the supposed menace of Iran's nuclear bomb, politics has rejected its most precious obligation, to set the world's dangers in context and react proportionately. The imperative to exploit public fear is as old as power itself, but modern media give it a new menace. It enables leaders to suppress the dictates of reason and, however briefly, mesmerise the public into obedience. In 2003 Tony Blair decided to show off by sending 400 Household Cavalry in tanks to Heathrow ""to counter terrorism"", as a preliminary to a blitz of legislation curbing civil liberty. The image of a city under siege wiped millions off Britain's tourism account, but Blair got his legislation. The continued efforts of the big defence lobby to persuade the British people that they still live under the threat of a nuclear winter has become little more than high-class job protection and profit maintenance. Yet it is bought hook, line and sinker by most politicians and commentators. George Osborne has at least boldly told the defence chiefs that, if the nuclear threat to Britain is so grave, that is precisely what the existing defence budget is for. There was no threat to Britons, or the world, proportionate with the response to last spring's ash cloud, swine flu, Osama bin Laden or, for that matter, to liquids in carry-on flight bags. Europe's airport giants are even now wrestling with the question of whether a camembert is a ""liquid"". The great conflation of fear – often egged on by ""the science"" – is the result of government gladly allowing itself to go mad for a day, to raise a fear, glean a headline or win a budget rise. Obama grotesquely exaggerated the oil threat to advance his personal and party cause. He is now struggling to downplay it. The US Travel Association is suing BP for $500m in promotional compensation. Why not sue the president? It was he who led the charge in disaster rhetoric, with a daily stream of negative publicity for the Gulf of Mexico, before trying, somewhat pathetically, to make up for it. He and others were surely accessories after the fact.",Oil spilled. But hysteria did the real damage in the Gulf | Simon Jenkins,2010-08-17T18:59:10Z,Simon Jenkins,world
"The etymology of the Glaswegian word ""bevvy"" is not difficult to unravel. Meaning to drink alcohol heartily, it is a derivation of its well-behaved older sister ""beverage"", a word whose rectitude is beloved of licensing committees everywhere. ""Bevvy"" had its finest moment in 1971 when Jimmy Reid introduced it to the world during the Upper Clyde Shipworkers' work-in. ""There will be no hooliganism, there will be no vandalism, there will be no bevvying,"" he told UCS workers, ""because the world is watching."" Reid uttered ""bevvying"" with a special emphasis on the B. He stated it with the relish of one who knows he is making history and who is enjoying introducing the rest of the planet to the riches of the language of his people. Jimmy Reid has died, aged 78. He was one of postwar Scotland's four most inspirational and important people; the others being Jock Stein, Billy Connolly and Margo MacDonald. Reid and his fellow union leaders refused to accept that five Clyde shipyards and 6,000 workers could be liquidised by Edward Heath's Tory government. For 14 months, they occupied the yards, working hard, managing the yards and filling the order books. Heath backed down and announced £35m of investment in Upper Clyde shipbuilding, which in turn enkindled another £65m in grants. Throughout this wonderful demonstration of the nobility and effectiveness of labour, a grateful and proud city supported their men. Glasgow knows something of what it takes to cause fat Tories sleepless nights; 52 years previously, a mass general strike was being organised and the Red Flag was raised in George Square before Winston Churchill sent the tanks into the city centre. It is a tactic long beloved of Tory leaders. By turning the forces of the state – the police and the army – against fellow working people they demoralise the entire movement. It was perfected by Margaret Thatcher during the 1984 miners' strike when she bribed almost the entire police force to act like thugs against their own. Jimmy Reid, though, was more than a match for Ted Heath. The strength of his oratory and the reasonableness of his case had the Tories floundering. That his workers could underpin Reid's eloquence with hard work and discipline meant there could only be one winner. Immediately following his death, some commentators qualified their admiration for Jimmy Reid by stating that his fine words, high principles and noble bearing had little or no lasting effect. They pointed out that the Clyde shipyards were soon becalmed anyway. Others pointed to the triumph of the market and the annihilation of socialism in the years that followed to justify diminishing the impact of this beautiful man. They are all missing the point of Jimmy Reid's greatness and its source. Like Stein, Connolly and MacDonald, Jimmy Reid made working people proud of themselves and he helped give them an identity and a voice. Then, two and a half decades after the Second World War, there were still precious few opportunities for intelligent men and women from industrial communities to make economic progress in the world. The vast majority of Britain's war dead were from these areas. Thousands of bright, working-class men and women had to forfeit the luxury of a university education as they fulfilled their family duties to dead brothers and uncles. When Jimmy Reid rocked the chinless ingrates of Heath's doomed government in 1971, my father and my friends' fathers claimed him as their own. Here was a man with no formal education and speaking in the benighted Glaswegian working dialect who nevertheless was brighter than an entire rectory of Oxbridge graduates. The UCS work-in was also when Clause Four enjoyed its finest moment. The workers did indeed take over the means of production and saved their families' immediate economic future and that of their surrounding communities. Jimmy Reid had provided a template for how to defeat the avarice of unfettered Toryism and corporate greed. Reid gave us confidence and renewed our pride. Would Thatcher have been able to defeat the miners if Jimmy Reid had been her adversary instead of the unhinged Arthur Scargill? Reid would never have faced down the Tories and their police attack dogs without a mandate from his union, nor would he have alienated an entire wing, as Scargill did with his Nottinghamshire members. His oratory, based on reason and a sense of justice and fortified by Christian socialism, would have seduced many more British workers to the miners' cause. Thatcher would not have escaped unscathed. Socialism was a vibrant and reasonable political philosophy when Jimmy Reid carried its banner and Clause Four was a decent and logical aspiration. Then the opportunists of Islington – Mandelson, Blair, Balls and the Milibands – killed them both. They have been revealed as the quisling envoys of capitalism sent by the City to do a job on the Labour party from the inside. They succeeded and the triumph of rabid capitalism seems complete. And what of we, the people who once thrilled to Jimmy Reid's words and who gathered beneath his banner to defeat another rich man's government? The gluttony of bankers brought this country to the brink of catastrophe, yet tens of thousands of honest, industrious families who have always rendered unto the government their portion, will pay with their jobs. Meanwhile, their sons are still being slaughtered in an illegal war, sent there by another government of millionaires. Yet socialism is considered to be a dirty word. We are too anaesthetised by EastEnders and The X Factor and Channel Five to do anything about it. We allowed Blair and his false prophets to kill our party. The conditions once more are ripe for work-ins up and down the country. Can Jimmy Reid's memory light the fire? And would some of those who come to praise him now be prepared to pick up his standard?",Let's restart Jimmy Reid's revolution | Kevin McKenna,2010-08-14T23:04:14Z,Kevin McKenna,politics
"One of the more overlooked figures in the subculture that swirled around punk rock was a sometime resident of Cambridge named Jolyean McFie. By the late 1970s, he was in charge of a self-explanatory enterprise called Better Badges, who supplied their wares to a range of rock groups, including Blondie and Joy Division. At 30-odd years' distance, it would be easy to think of him as a mere small businessman, but these were times in which even the production of lapel-decorations was charged with real ideological oomph. ""We were a proactive company,"" he recalls. ""We never waited for people to ask us to make a badge; we were on the side of fans rather than the bands, though usually, a happy medium was reached. This tied in with the original slogan I had thought up: 'Image is virus, disease is cure.'"" The words come from Neil Taylor's oral history of Rough Trade – the shop, record label and distribution company whose tangled story doubles as the biography of Geoff Travis, a music obsessive about as far from the standard stereotype of the record-industry hustler as could be imagined: a softly spoken figure whose eccentricity has always been expressed via rather monkish traits rather than verbosity or bad behaviour. His tale alone would be thin gruel, were it not for the book's supporting cast: a head-spinning roll-call of groups – from Scritti Politti, through the Smiths, to the latter-day Strokes and Libertines – as well as other driven, brilliantly idealistic people, convinced that music and its attendant culture could somehow embody a better kind of society. On the occasions that it really takes flight, the text is cut from the same cloth as Jonathon Green's history of 60s London, Days in the Life, evoking the tail-end of an era when Notting Hill was still a byword for countercultural mischief. The writer and Rough Trade ally Jon Savage, for example, is quoted thus: ""We lived in this miserable shithole, but we also took energy from it, because this was our playground . . . here was this big empty space that we could claim and traverse, which of course is now impossible in London."" The Rough Trade story intersects with that of Manchester's Factory Records, which will be forever synonymous with the late Tony Wilson, the short but spectacular career of Joy Division, and the club-cum-cathedral that was the Haçienda. Another enterprise born of New Left philosophy and punk zeal, Factory has already been documented in an array of books and two feature films. Nice's treatment is a matter of mind-boggling detail and not much context, which tends to result in either niche-ish arcana (I revelled in the ups and downs of the second-string Factory act A Certain Ratio, but that's partly down to a kind of anoraky masochism), or bathos. At the start, Nice describes Wilson's baby as a ""post-punk Bauhaus, Manchester crucible, dialectical toyshop"" (whatever that is), though there is much more fun in his frequent collisions with clay-footed musicians: ""Crispy Ambulance was the worst band name on the label, until he signed Thick Pigeon."" What unites the stories is a shared historical moment – in essence, the aftershocks of punk rippling into the cultural destruction fomented by Thatcherism – also documented in such accomplished books as Simon Reynolds's Rip It Up and Start Again and David Cavanagh's My Magpie Eyes Are Hungry for the Prize, a brilliantly forensic history of Alan McGee's Creation label. Against that backdrop, both these tales are reducible to the fate of two models of left-bohemian utopianism, and the various hopes, delusions and problems therein. Wilson's motivation came partly from the Situationist International, that endlessly cited gang of European misfits who aimed to somehow kick down the wall separating art and everyday life; the heyday of Rough Trade, by contrast, found it surrounded by what one insider recalls as ""uptown Marxists, downtown Marxists, even some genuine Cambridge commies"". The Rough Trade high-command considered Factory's prime movers ""mad"", which speaks volumes about the great attitudinal gap that separated them, perfectly crystallised by the light years between Travis and Wilson – one an ethereal kind of pragmatist, the latter a gleefully hopeless businessman and compulsive self-mythologiser, whose gilded view of Factory's story soon blurred with reality in just the way he wanted. Both, however, stumbled thanks to the same tension: the impossibility of squaring countercultural ways with the more banal stuff of profit and loss. Laid low by Mancunian gang violence and decisively blitzed by the recession of the early 1990s, Factory closed its doors in 1992, around the same time that Rough Trade suffered its most serious crisis, from which it would not recover for the best part of a decade (though Travis kept busy as a manager – of, among others, Pulp). Periodically, Wilson would resurface with new projects, but eventually settled for an altogether quieter life — whereas after serial downshifts and reinventions, Travis and Rough Trade are still here. Of late, their most successful protégée has been the Welsh cod-soul singer Duffy, a blank canvas plucked from her native Wales, and happily converted into an easy-on-the-ear sensation very different from the angular, confrontational attractions of yore. Document and Eyewitness's treatment of its main players is affectionate-going-on-hagiographical, but the implication of that end-point is inescapable. The journey from the mid-70s to now denotes the arrival of an altogether duller world: music that tends to be reverential rather than iconoclastic, the once-fevered issue of how it's sold settled by the fact that it's now available for nothing, Situationists and ""Cambridge commies"" gone for ever — and badges reduced to what level-headed Americans have always known as mere buttons.

"In these the earliest days of our summer holidays we have twice been swimming. ""We must swim every day,"" my wife said, and so far the rest of us have obliged. Today may be different: heavier rain is forecast. But rain may not stop us. Summer holidays in northern Britain tend necessarily to promote a Dr Pangloss mood in which even the fiercest downpour has its brighter side. ""The sea often feels warmer in the rain,"" I heard myself saying; so today we may still squeeze on our diving shoes and exchange one kind of cold wet for another. The diving shoes are important. How did we ever manage without them? Since we first bought a pair a dozen summers ago, our approach to the sea has been completely transformed. We get close to it comfortably, stepping easily across sharp pebbles, barnacled rocks and the mussel shells that pile up above the tideline. Nothing can modify the shock of the sea itself (wetsuits could, but wetsuits would be going too far) or stop the shilly-shallying when we are only ankle-deep. We debate whether the water is colder than the day before, or slightly warmer, or just the same: ""freezing"", we tell each other, trembling theatrically and pretending that this time we really shall turn back. There have been other debates. Shall we go to the sandy beaches on west side of the island or the rocky outcrops on the east? The first are windier but have a gentler descent. The jaggedness of the second can mean scraped knees, but the water is flatter and clearer. More important, to those of us who like their sticking plaster pulled off with a jerk or when faced with a firing squad would refuse a blindfold, you have to plunge in. Out again, after five minutes' brisk breaststroke, we feel slightly heroic. We wonder how long a human body could survive in such temperatures. A couple of hours at most was my guess yesterday, until my wife pointed out that torpedoed seamen on Arctic convoys had sometimes lasted longer and I remembered that quite a few people rescued from the Titanic had been pulled from water only one or two degrees above freezing: an April sea fit for icebergs. The Firth of Clyde in August is, of course, nowhere near so cold. You can see five-year-old children up to their waists in it, apparently unaffected, though this sight is rarer than it used to be. Swimming in the cold waters of north Britain is no longer so much a general summer pastime as a specialism for the fit and hardy – the kind of out-to-prove-a-pointers who assemble on snowy beaches on New Year's Day or swim 15 miles across the Minch from Skye to Harris. Elsewhere, even in the warm south, what was once known simply as ""bathing"" or ""going for a dip"" now goes by the title of ""wild swimming"", which has romanticised and organised a once commonplace pleasure and turned it into a cult. Wild swimming now has a small literature, as well as websites and TV shows. And its guidebooks no longer confine themselves to detailing freshwater lakes or rediscovering the kind of secret, riverine swimming hole that on a hot afternoon allowed young Victorian gentleman to imagine themselves as ancient Greeks. The latest covers coastal bays and beaches. Wild swimming, in other words, means what ""swimming"" did in 1960, before most of Britain had the means to reach the tamer and more tepid Mediterranean, where the sea comes as a relief and not a challenge. Last month, before we came north, I came across a wild-swimming party in Cornwall. The event was advertised in the programme of the Port Eliot festival, and there they were, men, women and children swimming back and forth across the muddy creek in the grounds of Port Eliot House, yelping with pleasure and coming out to sit in a hot tub or, while their children rolled in the mud, to drink cocktails in a bar that had been fashioned from an old boat. I hadn't known if I would like the festival, which is mainly devoted to a mixture of books and music and has been described as a smaller and more refined version of Glastonbury. There had been warnings: ""the West London boho scene"" and ""Cath Kidston washbags"" were two of them, and on the train from Paddington those forebodings were borne out by the crowd that packed the aisles and the vestibules. Never before have I seen gathered in one place so many girls with bare brown legs, mid-calf boots and summer frocks. Never before have I been on a train where people drank champagne from paper cups while squatting on the floor outside the lavatory door. Never before was I made so aware of a young male fashion for the pork-pie hat. And with these costumed scenes came the noise of a forthright, chummy confidence, so that everyone sounded like Mr and Mrs Cameron discussing the economic future of India. I got over it. The festival audience, it turned out, wasn't completely a monoculture. A man I met described Port Eliot wryly as ""Britain's leading festival of middle-classness"", but most festivals involving books are to different degrees middle class, as are most authors. In any case, what were the bare brown legs and the pork-pie hats doing but enjoying themselves, politely, harmlessly and without falling over? Irony played its usual English role. Women in the get-up of 1940s chars – pinnies, headscarves and lipstick-smeared cigarettes – served tea from a trolley. A band dressed as 1950s bus conductors played accordions and fiddles around a movable bus stop. Kayakers went off with their paddles. Grayson Perry gave a talk and Anita Pallenberg judged a fashion show, and all of it happened inside a beautiful private landscape owned by the Earl of St Germans, who was at one time ""a wealthy bohemian"" – that small social category loved by the old William Hickey column - and perhaps still is. Little of this may be typical of workaday Cornwall, a place so poor that alone among English regions it still receives subsidy from the EU's convergence fund. But you could see Port Eliot as part of a pattern. Together with houses priced beyond the local market, Rick Stein's restaurants, surfing at Newquay and merrymaking public schoolboys in Rock, it demonstrates Cornwall's enduring appeal as a summer resort for the English middle classes. Few other parts of Britain have known such loyalty, outside exceptional little towns such Southwold and Whitstable, North Berwick and Elie. The climate and cheap flights to the sun are usually blamed, but it may not be so simple as that. The house I'm writing this was built in as a holiday home for middle-class Glaswegians in the 1870s, when the Firth of Clyde was emerging as one of the premier playgrounds of Europe. For more than a hundred years, nobody in any social class in western Scotland thought of going much further. And then industry began to collapse, and with it the confidence of a singular culture that holidayed in its own places and did things its own way. That flourishes again in the richer parts of London. Only when I see bare-legged girls in boots and wild-swimming parties in Bute will I be confident of its spread north. Until that time we shall shiver, bravely but probably alone, on the rocks.",Wild swimming in Cornwall - freezing in Bute | Ian Jack,2010-08-07T06:00:09Z,Ian Jack,uk
"Is there some kind of tear in the very fabric of the news universe? It has been a week in which areas one would hope to be discrete have collapsed troublingly into one other. Not only has Naomi Campbell been to the Hague, but the People's Republic of China is frontrunner to buy Liverpool football club. Well, I say the People's Republic itself, though obviously that would put pressure on space in the directors' box at Anfield. Rather, the bid is being fronted by the entrepreneur Kenny Huang, but is widely believed to be financially backed by the China Investment Corporation, the investment arm of the Chinese government. Though it's not even the first time representatives of a foreign government have tried to buy Liverpool – Thaksin Shinawatra had a crack while he was still Thai prime minister – this latest development would seem to mark the moment at which the already storied history of the Premier League finally tipped into overblown satire. We're now officially living in the age of the football-industrial complex. Clearly, any China-backed purchase of Liverpool would offer excellent potential for cultural exchange – I should like Mao's embalmed body to be brought for a ceremonial lying in state in front of the Kop, or at the very least to see the old devil paraded for photocall in the manner of a new star signing, ideally wearing a strip reading CHAIRMAN on the back. As yet, the benefits of Liverpool gaining representation on the UN security council are unquantified, but can be surely estimated as being worth at least three points a season. Such synergies all depend, of course, on the Chinese government being able to pass the Premier League's ""fit and proper person"" test for new owners – although famously, no one has ever failed it. In fact, I couldn't be more sure of an outcome were Usain Bolt to offer to race me to the corner shop. In the interests of accuracy, the aforementioned test has been renamed the ""owners and directors test"", presumably because post-Thaksin et al it became impossible to say ""fit and proper person"" without doing immensely sarcastic air quotes. What the amendment to this flimsiest of forms shakes down to is a requirement for would-be owners to prove they have the funds to sustain a club, which, Premier League's chief executive Richard Scudamore has declared, will prevent ""a repeat of the Portsmouth situation"". How long before the league finally accepts its geopolitical importance, and Scudamore upgrades his silly little test ""to prevent a repeat of the Korean peninsula situation""? For now, though I'm no expert, one imagines Beijing will be good for the cash. China is apparently doing quite well at the moment, and while there'll doubtless be the usual gripes about not wanting to pay over the odds for a right back, it probably helps if the person holding the purse strings is the second largest economy in the world as opposed to Dave Whelan. As for further background checks, I think the powers that be will recognise a clubbable sort in the Chinese government. When itinerant chiseller Sven-Göran Eriksson was weighing up whether to take the job managing Manchester City, then owned by Thaksin, he deployed the most rigorous of vetting procedures to assess the former Thai PM's record. ""It was enough for me to make a phone call to [Premier League chairman] Sir Dave Richards,"" Eriksson explained. ""He [replied], 'Absolutely clean'."" That's how it works, you see. Though not a noted expert in south-east Asian politics – Thaksin's human rights record had been widely condemned and he was under threat of corruption and fraud charges – Sir Dave is what is known in the game as a ""football man"". Considering that fellow holders of this epithet include Ken Bates and Phil Gartside, you might suspect ""football man"" is merely a euphemism for a word we don't print in the Guardian unless it's in reported speech. But ""football men"" have made the Premier League what it is, bless them, and it would take more than whinges about state-sponsored human rights abuse to take the wind out of their radioactive self-belief. Just as modern China is a grimly chastening rebuke to those who claimed you can't have capitalism without democracy, so the Premier League of recent years has been a similarly rude slap in the face to those who declare you can't just waltz in and buy a club and imagine you own it. One of the running jokes beloved of my colleagues on the Fiver about this period is to parrot the Bill Shankly-inspired line that ""118 years of history and tradition isn't for sale"" – before adding ""except when it is"". In the end, what is the history of the Premier League, if not capitalism without democracy? Whether disgusted fans of any team think that this year's passing oligarch or asset-stripper truly ""owns"" their club is presumably a matter of as much concern to said oligarchs or asset-strippers as the views of peasants are to the Chinese government. Which is to say, bugger all concern. The only surprise about China's bid is that the so-called People's Republic didn't alight on the Premier League sooner. They really are made for each other.",We're living in the age of the football-industrial complex | Marina Hyde,2010-08-06T20:00:00Z,Marina Hyde,world
"So before Dave went to India, he said to pick some art for the flat, supposing it ever gets finished, which is so kind of the government to offer but quite disturbing really, because it means Gordon Brown must have personally chosen that flayed lion being eaten by rats, in actual skin, that used to hang over the bed. But it was thanks but no thanks, I told Mummy, because you'd think from the list there hadn't been an important artist since Sergeant and, to be honest, everyone's got one of those. I mean, hello, Government Art Collection – Banksy or Eine anyone? It's as if the whole avant-garde street arty thing never happened. God knows what you're meant to do if you're going for a pared-down look with basically an eclectic mix of bold abstracts, photographs and irreverent stencils to subvert the hideous corporate vibe – losing battle with Cherie's crystal pelmets, the architect says, since it turns out she actually got them listed. The little clerk in charge was so sweet at first, said Cherie hasn't returned the Sergeants yet anyway, but he was sure there was a Vanessa Bell somewhere, lots of orange, very modern, look lovely with the futons. Well, I went, absolutely no disrespect but if this is really all you've got, would the government like to borrow some stuff of ours, there's way too much for the flat? I can't be certain until they've repainted the drawing room in blighted udder, as intended – unbelievable Cable thought I'd be taken in by the Homebase magnolia – but we could probably spare the large Gobshite and a couple of quite rare Philths, from when he was still using his own bodily fluids. Instead of leaping at the chance, clerky man goes all huffy, so I'm like, I do have a degree in fine art, for what it's worth, as well as counting Gobshite, Dregz and the Grotmeister as personal friends.

"There are headlines that force the reader to check the date. And then there is this week's ""Elton John working on Animal Farm musical"", which would seem to elevate the spaghetti harvest to the status of a Walter Cronkite report. Yet rigorous factchecking confirms we are not in early April. Along with Lee Hall, with whom he collaborated so successfully on the Billy Elliot musical, Sir Elt really is planning to fashion a West End show from George Orwell's dystopian satire on Stalinism, the corruption of power, and high-kicking chorus pigs. It is believed to be his first foray into addressing the iniquities of the totalitarian state since Nikita. One's kneejerk reaction is to grasp for precedents for such a potentially entertaining night of singalong theatre. In the Australian sitcom Kath and Kim, Melbourne housewife Kath takes the role of Virginia Woolf in a local musical version of The Hours that features a hotpanted Virginia committing suicide behind cardboard waves while trilling, ""I feel like I'm sinking"". Elsewhere, Marge Simpson was cast as Blanche DuBois in a musical entitled ""Oh, Streetcar!"". ""Cool, she can fly!"" marvels Homer, as Marge is tossed and battered above the stage by a system of flies and pulleys. It is left to Lisa to point out that the device is supposed to symbolise Blanche's descent into madness. Cued by Blanche's famous last line, the production ends on a hilariously upbeat number called Kindness of Strangers. To contemplate Animal Farm: the Musical, therefore, is to ponder the choreography possibilities of ""four legs good, two legs bad"", and whether it is acceptable to rhyme ""swinging lovers"" with ""more equal than others"". But this, as I say, is the kneejerk reaction. In fact there is no reason that a musical retelling of Animal Farm should strip it entirely of bite. Billy Elliot contains a rousing number in which the miners wish Maggie Thatcher a Merry Christmas ""cos it's one day closer to your death"". Indeed, Animal Farm was originally subtitled ""a fairy story"", and Orwell's aim was to render his story in a manner that ensured the widest appeal. Reviewing the 1954 animated version of the work, the Manchester Guardian declared it ""ensured that many more people will ponder over Animal Farm"". What is crucial for the integrity of this new musical, however, is that the novella's story is not significantly tweaked – and in this respect, Animal Farm has an intriguing history. Its most notable previous mass-market adaptation was the aforementioned animation, which, it eventually emerged, was secretly produced by the CIA. During the cold war, the agency established a covert division to fund a huge range of anti-communist cultural activities, for which hundreds of millions of dollars were siphoned from the Marshall plan (rather self-parodically Soviet of them, you'll agree). Though the CIA still refuse freedom of information requests about their involvement in the Animal Farm movie on ""national security"" grounds, several insider accounts maintain they insisted on its ending being altered. The book, you'll recall, concludes with the horrified realisation that the pigs' faces are indistinguishable from those of the humans. Yet the film ends with a farmyard revolt against the pigs, who are presumably overthrown. ""Orwell would certainly not have liked this,"" observed the Manchester Guardian. Indeed not. Nor would he have been thrilled by the 1956 film adaptation of Nineteen Eighty-Four, which has Winston Smith going down Butch-and-Sundance-style in a blaze of glorious defiance, as opposed to capitulating. Today, it is the moneymen more than the propagandists who nurse an aversion to what one critic called Orwell's ""stories of defeat"". The ineluctable commercial imperative for things to end on an ""up"" is satirised deliciously in Robert Altman's movie The Player, where Richard E Grant is pitching his profoundly bleak movie to Tim Robbins's studio exec. Not only does Grant decree the picture should feature no stars – ""this story is too damn important to risk being overwhelmed by personality"" – but the film ends with the heroine's death.

"Perkins went so utterly postal when she heard we'd be around 17 for the weekend that I slightly wanted to cry, since no wives or children were involved, just the beagles, but Dave said be cool babes, remember Gordon was a loner, give her time. Then Mummy said absolutely not, rule one with staff is never let them brood, remember Simms when you were small and the poor rabbits? Such good advice because it turned out, hilarious, to be all about that vomit by the pool and as soon as we'd fixed a price for accidents (£20, or £30 on Sundays, bargain!) Perkins was fine. But sad, really, because she is fascinating on the history of the place, if only Govey had bunged her a tenner instead of the The Life and Times of Siegmund Warburg they would have so got on, but then you think of his background, can't be helped. Fairly tense by the time the coach arrived, but after bloody marys the PowerPoints flew past, at least until Govey's Europe lecture, which sadly crashed some time around the Napoleonic wars. Perkins said sorry, typical Chequers electrics, but Dave quickly went no worries awaydayers, I think we all know about the Charge of the Light Brigade! So after lunch they could choose between beagling, table-tennis or rolling down a hill in a Portaloo, and I could see the poor Liberals looking so conflicted even though Oik was paying, but at dinner Dave said Huhne had managed seven complete revolutions before the toilet exploded; I mean, who knew? A bit tricky later, asking the girls if they wouldn't be more comfortable next door, but once Caroline – or Khalida, whatever she calls herself now – said purdah is so empowering Theresa could hardly stay, and afterwards it really was the most intense bonding experience Dave says, except for Cable, and when I drifted off they were still singing We Are the Coalition outside the police hut. Doubling up just brought them closer, except for Cable, and I hardly noticed Cleggsy – or no more, I told him, than you would a large dog. Perkins was so thrilled with her £120 bonus and I know, once she's done the clean-up, Cable's trousers will turn up somewhere.",Mrs Cameron's diary,2010-07-28T21:00:43Z,Catherine Bennett,politics
"If David Cameron is feeling a tad frustrated by the lack of progress in the Middle East – breaking with usual diplomatese during a visit to Turkey todayto brand Gaza a ""prison camp"" – then he is not the only one. ""Everything is stuck,"" sighs Jamal Zahalka, a Palestinian member of the Israeli parliament on a visit to London. The small Arab nationalist party he leads is formally committed to the two-state solution which would see a Palestinian state alongside Israel, but he sees no prospect of it. Those in charge are interested only in ""conflict management, not resolution"", he says. Talk of two states lives on in the seminar room, but it is not on any horizon visible in the real world. I'm told the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, is ""on the verge"" of giving up on the two-state approach he has believed in since the 70s. And there are plenty of Israeli Jews who share that pessimism. So it's hardly surprising that people are searching for other answers, even lighting upon an idea long confined to the margins, advocated only by extremists and dreamers: the ""one-state solution."" This holds that the two warring peoples should not live in two separate entities, with separate flags and governments, but as citizens of a single state. Jews and Arabs would no longer face each other anywhere as occupier and occupied, as they do now. They would live side by side, in a shared country. But here's the twist. This vision comes not from diehard Arab rejectionists, who refuse to countenance any arrangement which allows for a distinct Jewish state, nor from old-school student lefties from the 80s, once tireless in their advocacy of a ""sec dem"" – as in secular, democratic – state. No, the new advocates of the one-state solution are the Israeli nationalist right, including several luminaries of the settlers' movement. The most prominent to break cover was Moshe Arens, who served as both foreign and defence minister in the Begin-Shamir era two decades ago. He wrote last month that it was time for Israel to look at ""another option"", one that would see a single state on the land that is now Israel and the West Bank. The Palestinians who live there would, wrote Arens, no longer be a people under occupation but full citizens. As Haaretz has reported, its editorial jaw dropping, the former minister has been joined by an array of rightist eminences, including a founder of the settlers' organisation, Gush Emunim, a former chief of staff to Binyamin Netanyahu, a senior Likud member of the Knesset, and the parliament's current speaker. To understand quite how taboo-busting this is, recall the case of the scholar Tony Judt. In 2003 he too floated the notion of a single state to be shared by both Arabs and Jews. Judt's essay was instantly denounced as anti-Zionist heresy; among many Israel supporters he was rapidly ostracised. Thereafter Judt was identified as firmly on the radical left of the Israel-Palestine debate. Yet now those same thoughts are aired on the radical right. For all that, it is not so hard to see why this once forbidden notion now appeals to Israel's nationalist camp. The two-state solution may be conventional wisdom across the globe, endorsed by almost all democratic governments, but for settlers and their allies the very idea reeks of trauma: any division of the land is assumed to entail the dismantling of the towns and villages they call home. For the devout, this means leaving places they regard as part of the ancient biblical homeland. Some threaten armed resistance; rightwing soldiers warn they will refuse any order to evacuate settlements. But if there's a single state, all that trauma can be avoided. ""It's preferable for the Palestinians to become citizens of the state than for us to divide the country,"" says Knesset speaker and Likud MK Reuben Rivlin. What's more, there would be no place for the current wall, or separation barrier, that some rightists believe disfigures and artificially divides what should be the sacred, and whole, Land of Israel. How has the right come to this new realisation? In a word: Gaza. Before Israel's 2005 disengagement from the strip, any talk of a single state struck demographic fear into Israeli hearts. For if Israel were to absorb the Palestinians of both the West Bank and Gaza, their combined number would instantly endanger the country's Jewish majority: there would soon be numerical parity between Jews and Arabs. But for Arens et al, that link to Gaza has now been severed, taking its 1.5 million Palestinians off the books, as it were. That leaves the Palestinians of the West Bank, estimated variously as 1.5 or 2 million, whom Israel could just about absorb. At first glance, this new direction might look appealing to Palestinians too. Plenty are sick of waiting for a state that never materialises: why not continue the struggle on a new front, using their strength of numbers at the Israeli ballot box? There would be immediate benefits. Families split by the 1967 battlelines might be unified once more; Palestinians would have access to jobs and economic opportunities inside Israel. But they should pause. For one thing, the rightist one-staters are making no instant promises: the granting of citizenship would, they warn, be ""gradual"". Nor are they offering a truly binational state that would grant equal status to the two nations. Instead Israel would remain a Jewish state, with West Bank Palestinians offered only the civil rights owed to them as individuals, not any national, collective recognition. They would be treated much the same way as the 1 million Palestinians who are already citizens of Israel. Given the long history of discrimination that community has endured, that might not be such an enticing prospect. When I put the idea to Zahalka's fellow parliamentarian, Haneen Zoabi, she was adamant: to accept such an offer would amount to surrendering the Palestinian claim of sovereignty over the West Bank. ""We will never give that up,"" she said. Israeli Jews have every reason to be equally sceptical of this one-state talk. If Zoabi is right that West Bankers will not accept citizenship in a Jewish state, then the alternative is a properly binational entity. Yet what evidence is there that two peoples who couldn't get along well enough to negotiate a divorce will do better in a marriage? Support for such an idea is close to zero. It is hard to see that changing so long as Israelis, and Jews around the world, continue to yearn for the thing that almost every other nation takes for granted: a state of their own. And yet this development is not to be dismissed out of hand. The one-staters of the right say they are raising the issue now because the status quo has become intolerable to world opinion, corroding Israel's legitimacy. ""The international community takes that stance because we are still occupiers,"" one Likud MK said. ""There will be greater legitimacy when the occupation ends."" That the right has finally reached this realisation is good news in itself. Avraham Burg, a former Labour politician on an ideological journey of his own, says these new noises from the right will put pressure on Netanyahu, forcing him to reach a two-state solution before it's too late. ""The days of the two-state solution are numbered,"" Burg says. ""It's not there forever, with no expiration date."" The Israeli right are banking on the assumption that it's already too late. It's up to those who still believe that two states represent the last, best hope for both Israelis and Palestinians to prove them wrong. • Comments on this article are set to remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight",The Israeli right has a new vision – Jews and Arabs sharing one country | Jonathan Freedland,2010-07-27T20:00:16Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"Enid Blyton was literary contraband when I was growing up, banned from the household on feminist grounds. All the girls are really wet; the ones who aren't are either aberrations (George) or swiftly punished, female initiative being automatic cause for sharp comeuppance. It would have taken a lot more than a word like ""golly"" to put us off all that intoxicating forbidden patriarchy. With the hindsight, now, of some decades spent reading other books, I'm going to stick my neck out and say Blyton was a bit thick. She knew how to make a pot boil, but she had a conventional mind and a curtain-twitching sensibility. So these books are perfect for updating, because any child who can be faffed to decode phrases like ""school tunic"" - and think themselves into a world where parents are accorded the respectful ""mother"" and ""father"" - will be on the brink of noticing how narrow-minded the author is, if they haven't already. But I could just be speaking out loud the indoctrination of my mother who, incidentally, now thinks In The Night Garden is racist. And yet, the principle of updating language in a book is depressing. Sure, take the hard words out of Dickens, if you absolutely insist on giving it to a seven-year-old (though they have perfectly good books of their own, you know; they're called Harry Potter). But the Famous Five series was, I believe, written for children. In expunging the dated words, you strip out their personality: and even if you don't particularly like that personality, it's better than none at all, a skeletal adventure without the flesh of authorial voice. Plus, how are modern authors supposed to rip off these plots, if they're going to be rewritten for today's audience anyway? I'm sure this is bad for British industry, at a delicate time. I wonder what Vince Cable thinks. At the risk of sounding childish, before they update the words, they might like to work on the names. Dick? In 2010?

"More than strawberries at Wimbledon, rained-off Test matches and politicians' holidays, one image is now solidly built into the British understanding of summer: as seen in just about every current commercial break, a festival crowd, joyously jumping around to anthemic indie-rock and rejoicing in the apogee of modern togetherness. Strange to think, perhaps, that the tangled roots of all this go back to events – from the original, police-free Glastonbury, through illicit acid house parties and beyond – that the straight world tended to greet with a mixture of panic and hostility. Now the promise is of family-friendliness, a visit from Prince Charles, and unending coverage on the BBC. This week, then, has brought particularly unsettling news. A week after an alleged sexual assault and two attempted murders at Scotland's T in the Park, last weekend's Latitude festival saw two reported rapes and an incident in which a girl was harassed and chased by a pack of ""drunken yobs"". At any event, such news would be grim, but part of yesterday's massed gasp of shock was traceable to what Latitude is: a self-consciously high-end event, keen to attract a more mature kind of attendee, and a byword for cultured relaxation rather than lairy excess. Hence one of the choicest quotes from Melvyn Benn, the chief executive of Latitude's organisers, Festival Republic: ""It is difficult to find any nastiness or aggression at Latitude. This is shocking."" It is, but a few points demand to be made. One is about the rather naive view of festivals that defines whole swaths of the summer's media coverage, much of it put together in comfy backstage compounds by people whose experience of the nitty-gritty is limited, to say the least. Breathlessly enthusiastic satellite news reports (""Dave from Wrexham – is this your first Glastonbury?"") and the obligatory Saturday morning pictures of girls astride their boyfriends' shoulders do not quite convey what anyone who has spent three days out in the fields will know: that once tens of thousands of people are temporarily living cheek by jowl and many are set on joyously losing their minds, the festival experience can sometimes go awry. Often thanks to their chemical intake, I know plenty of people whose summer weekends have at least partly been defined by fear, disorientation, and brushes with unpleasant people who were there for something other than the vibes. At 1994's Glastonbury, for instance, I can well remember the fear spread by a shooting on the Saturday night, as well as subsequent news that someone had been slashed in the face (on the Monday, the Guardian's headline was, ""Music festival peace and love marred by overdose death and gun attack""). It doesn't quite fit with what might be called the BBC3 worldview, but it's an obvious enough point: there is a certain part of the festival milieu – or, rather, the illicit economy – that will always teeter into nastiness, and worse. Quite apart from that kind of incident, the news from Latitude points up something arguably even more uncomfortable. Consider again an account of that aforementioned girl's experience at the hands of those ""yobs"": ""They had stuck their hands down her top and pinched her bum. She hid in the toilets so they wouldn't know where she was staying before coming back."" There is not much organisers can do about it, but perhaps this is what occasionally happens once festival culture has become everyone's property. It'll sound hopelessly sniffy, but what the hell: back when some of the big festivals were defined by a sense of countercultural esprit de corps, many elements of the human zoo were present and correct – but you rarely encountered what might be called the stag weekend demographic. Still, in response to the current festival-related headlines, no one should get too carried away. In late 1969, when an 18-year-old named Meredith Hunter was stabbed to death by Hells Angels at the Rolling Stones' infamous outdoor concert at Altamont in northern California, the incident entered rock lore as the Death of the Hippie Dream, rather than a stupid consequence of the band's decision to contract-out ""security"" to pool cue-wielding thugs. Similarly, to characterise the events at T in the Park and Latitude as some awful fall from innocence would suit the over-excited terms in which such events are reported but do a disservice to the underrated revelation that burns through each year's festival season. Our take on the modern outdoor ritual is coloured by understandable nostalgia for the glory days of Hawkwind and free admission, and a hyperactive culture often stops us realising which aspects of contemporary living are truly remarkable – but our festival culture definitely is. It is some token of most human beings' capacity for gentleness and decency that the season usually passes without serious incident; moreover, it's fascinating that as our everyday lives seem to find us ever more atomised and terrified of each other, so millions of people feel an ever greater need to spend weekend after weekend in each other's company. Rather than the odd ugly incident, it's that story that deserves our attention, and it should be a cause for nothing but (outdoor) celebration.",Festival violence: gentleness and decency will survive these vile attacks | John Harris,2010-07-21T07:00:37Z,John Harris,uk
"The way things are going, it probably makes a lot of sense to denounce baby-boomers. Especially if you actually are a baby-boomer and thus likely to excite peculiar hatred in the eyes of subsequent generations. Indeed, for all the advantages of having being born between 1945 and 1965, boomers do face one looming disadvantage: that of being cared for, in the era of assisted dying, by people who hate their guts. This category includes, one gathers, members of the boomers' own families, as they wait and wait for the selfish old monsters to part with their inheritance. On websites where baby-boomer crimes are itemised, use of the word ""cull"" is commonplace. As the reformed boomer Francis Beckett says in his protracted piece of public self-criticism, What Did the Baby-Boomers Ever Do For Us?: ""The generation war has started."" Will his personal contribution be enough to stop a future young carer lashing him to a commode or similar? To be on the safe side, he might want to consider accessorising his confessions with a dunce's cap (assuming the boomers have not already used up all the world's available dunces' caps, leaving nothing for future generations). The youthful mood, as Beckett reports, is unforgiving. He quotes one typical endorsement of his analysis, addressed to this country's heedless and corrupt boomers: ""Your selfish and arrogant generation makes me sick."" It is futile for non-rentier members of this cohort to wheedle to their impatient critics that, like the occasional good German, they did not personally speculate in property or raise tuition fees. Quite a few of them, history suggests, must have actively opposed Blairism and Thatcherism, the latter excitingly described by Beckett as ""crouching beneath the bridge of the 70s like a malignant troll"". But at its purest, intergenerational strife is beyond petty distinctions of innocence and guilt. ""Of course, not everyone born between 1945 and 1955 wanted the Iraq war, or the NHS turned into a market, or huge proportions of the nation's resources to be given to the nation's bankers,"" Beckett allows (by his boomer definition, I am glad to say, I am instantly pardoned). ""But the baby-boomers' chance to change Britain for the better came and it went."" Younger victims of boomerism, who speak with special contempt of their enemies' luxurious taste for Saga holidays, pampering and costly gadgets, are yet more unmoved by individual innocence. So you were, in fact, a redundant miner who never went abroad, or a grammar school reject forced to leave school at 15, or a subservient housewife, or a carbon-neutral founder of an organic smallholding? So what? Neither history, nor luck, has anything to do with it. Neil Boorman, a brand expert turned full-time hammer of boomers (or ""glut of needy pensioners""), explained this in a pre-election manifesto called It's All Their Fault: ""Each generation has a collective personality, which is shaped by the events of the time."" Or, alternatively, by the prejudices of its successors. In any event, he argued, young people should vote only for non-boomers with the exception of the Conservative universities minister David Willetts, whose recent book, The Pinch, has made him the darling of young boomerphobes and guilty boomers alike. Though his claim that boomers refuse to pass on their wealth could still, some think, be disproved in future by enhanced legacies to their children. ""No one writing in 2010 can speak with certainty about the extent to which the baby-boomers have let down, or will let down, their children,"" says the economist Tim Congdon. If you struggle to understand why angry young redistributors would lionise a wealthy Thatcherite Tory who has just described degree courses as ""a burden on the taxpayer"", this may be because you are too old. ""This isn't a fight between left and right or Labour versus Conservatives,"" says Boorman, steering his followers away from conventional engagement, ""it's between Generation Debt and the Baby-Boomers."" If so, it could be years before this disaffected cohort participates, seriously, in organised politics. What luck for the Conservatives. For those members of Generation Debt who are not insulted by it, the chronological approach must also simplify things. ""Boomers are easy to identify,"" says Boorman, reassuring those who worry that, without a scarlet B, it might be hard to spot some of the more Botoxed offenders. ""As of their birthday in 2010, they'll be aged between 46 and 64."" Another benefit of age-based politics, to judge by online confrontations, is that it transforms everything that has coincided with boomers roaming the earth into a potential grievance against them. While Willetts restricts himself to a story of economic betrayal, fellow campaigners, such as Francis Beckett, diagnose a more comprehensive moral bankruptcy on the part of Britain's soixante-huitards. Yes, we can blame the tanned, postwar phonies with all their If and free love and Blowin' in the Wind for the reimposition of school uniforms. ""We are forcing our children into prison uniform,"" writes this spiritual descendant of Holden Caulfield, ""so they will be instantly recognisable when they scale their prison walls."" So much for the Human Rights Act. And, also, for University Challenge. Once, says Beckett, the students had lovely Bamber Gascoigne. But now: ""Jeremy Paxman sneers at them, bullies them and holds them up to ridicule."" His sympathisers are no less inventive. HIV also emerged on the boomers' watch, along with CCTV, Islamist terrorism, paedophile scares, expensive nursery places, golf courses and excessive workplace sobriety. ""We're not allowed the pint at lunch which was considered quite normal during our parents' working lives,"" complains a victim, one of many who never seem quite sure whether to envy or to denounce the boomers for their decadence, real or imagined. Challengingly, for the ascetic tendency, there is little evidence in the technologically accomplished generation of any fundamental horror of material acquisitions, self-indulgence or cheap flights. But perhaps that, too, is the boomers' fault? It will be for the coming leaders of this generation to establish which of its complaints should be prioritised, so as to prevent older politicians dismissing protests about jobs, house prices and pensions, along with school uniform and the lack of wine fountains, as mere pretexts for emoting by a generation that appears to be adopting ""This Be the Verse"" as its anthem. As it is, even with the next anti-boomer tract, Jilted Generation, written by actual young people (Ed Howker and Shiv Malik), there seems little prospect of the understandable fury among the boomers' jobless descendants expressing itself as anything more constructive than indiscriminate resentment. Yet again, the pre-publicity promises the story of unclouded youth's betrayal, not by a specific ideology, party or political system but, simply, by all the repulsive old people who got born first. ""Jilted Generation is a call to arms that will make sure you never look at your parents (or your children) in the same way again,"" say the publishers. That sounds marvellous, darlings, well done.",Bashing my generation is the new sport for anyone born after 1965.

"The advance word was that this was to be a ""holding meeting"" and not much more. Barack Obama and Binyamin Netanyahu would not launch some grand initiative for the Middle East. Instead they would sit together, chat chummily and pose for photographers – particularly important given what happened a couple of months back, when an angry Obama kept Bibi waiting for hours in the West Wing, only to cut their meeting short without so much as posing for a souvenir snap. Accordingly, today's summit was all warm hugs and making nice. Obama spoke of the ""special bond"" between the two nations – even if there did have to be the occasional ""robust discussion"". Bibi nodded, adding that disagreements were what you got in a close ""family"" relationship like this one. Reports of any strain between them were ""flat wrong"", and to prove it Bibi invited the Obamas to Israel; Michelle showed Sara round the White House; and reporters were kept waiting during a long Bibi-Obama lunch, surely proof that the two men just couldn't get enough of each other. For all that, the advance billing of a holding meeting was not so far off the mark. The US president was certainly in no rush to make waves: he is four months away from midterm elections, in which support for Israel threatens to become an issue, at least in the handful of states where Jewish voters might make a difference. In several congressional contests Republicans are making mischief over the administration's recent relative firmness towards Israel, with one candidate accusing Obama of ""browbeating"" the Jewish state, while others suggest the Democratic administration is fraying the historic ties that have bound the two countries. Small wonder, then, that Obama was and remains keen to be all smiles with Bibi – at least until polling day on 2 November. The Israeli PM does not face imminent elections, but he too has been happy to go along with a strategy of pause and delay. For Netanyahu inaction is always preferable to action: only a demand for tricky concessions – say an extension of the current, partial moratorium on settlement building in the West Bank – might imperil his fragile coalition, by prompting the ultra-hawkish parties to bolt. So long as the Americans are not asking anything of him, Bibi can stay comfortably in his seat. There is a larger explanation for why the prime minister might be fond of stasis and inertia. The operating assumption held by both him and the nationalist right he leads is that Israel has time on its side. This is a belief deeply ingrained, one that draws sustenance from a century of Zionist history. The first Jewish settlers in Palestine pushed the boundaries of the possible, establishing themselves in places that initially seemed insanely ambitious, only for time to reward their daring. The Jews accepted a UN partition plan in 1947 that gave them 56% of Palestine, only to see their share leap to 78% by the end of the war of 1948-9. Playing the long game has worked before and, the Israeli right assumes, it will work again. You can see why Bibi would be drawn to such thinking. Each day that passes entrenches the Israeli presence in the West Bank. Consider that there were no Jewish settlers in 1967, around 120,000 in 1994 and more than 300,000 now – those numbers alone, which exclude East Jerusalem, constitute a powerful argument for playing it long, letting time change the facts on the ground until they are unalterable. Besides, what's the urgency? The Israeli economy is ticking along nicely, defying the global trends; the beachside cafes are full; Tel Aviv is even becoming the hot destination for gay tourism. Why risk change when the status quo is so tolerable? And yet the underlying assumption is almost certainly wrong. Israel does not have time on its side. On the contrary, time is running out fast. Israel is surrounded by evidence that it is, in the words of one Ha'aretz columnist, ""hurtling down the slippery slope of pariahdom"".  The Gaza flotilla episode exposed that fact most starkly, as Israel found itself isolated diplomatically, chastised by those it normally relies on as friends. First among those has always been the US. Israel has long been able to depend on rock-solid support from a Washington that saw merit in a loyal, semi-dependent state in a region that was unreliable at best and hostile at worst. But now that calculus has been shaken. Note the 54 Congressmen who issued a statement rebuking Israel over the flotilla. Note the paper by Anthony Cordesman, a fixture of the US foreign policy establishment, asking if Israel has become a ""strategic liability"" for America. Note too the comments of David Petraeus, now Nato commander in Afghanistan, warning that Israeli intransigence was adversely affecting US interests in the Middle East. This adds up to a new climate of opinion in which Obama can afford to be firm with Netanyahu because he knows he is not alone. The second source of previously iron support has been the mainstream Jewish diaspora, especially in the US. For decades, the official voices of American Jewry have uttered only words of unity and support; criticism was confined to the fringes. But now that too is changing. The institutional manifestation has been J Street, which in three short years has signed up some 100,000 supporters for its alternative to the dogmatic Israel-right-or-wrong stance of American Israel Public Affairs Committee. A key recent text is an essay by Peter Beinart that appeared in the New York Review of Books, castigating the US Jewish leadership for failing to condemn the ever-rightward drift of Israeli policy. Of course there is nothing new about Jewish opponents of Israel: they are older than the country itself. But what makes these interventions different is that they come from those who are avowedly Israel's friends. J Street's slogan is that it is ""pro-Israel, pro-peace""; Beinart is a former editor of the staunchly Zionist New Republic. There are echoes outside the United States, too. In Europe, JCall, an online petition, has rapidly attracted the signatures of those who have previously devoted themselves to public defences of Israel, including the French glamour-intellectuals Bernard-Henri Lévy and Alain Finkielkraut. Even the head of Britain's biggest pro-Israel charity last month insisted on the right of diaspora Jews to speak out, and bemoaned the lack of a peace strategy from the Israeli government. It is this that should shatter any Israeli complacency. For these are stirrings from deep within the pro-Zionist mainstream. They cannot be dismissed as the words of implacable enemies of Israel or the Jews; they are palpably nothing of the sort. Nor can they be ignored. Beinart's essay began with survey evidence showing young American-Jewish youth alienated and remote from Israel, with many expressing ""a near-total absence of positive feelings"". That sentence should strike fear into all those looking to Israel's long-term future. Until now, the chief long-range concern of the Israeli right was demographic, the fear that eventually Israel would rule over more Arabs than Jews, given the combined populations of Israel, the West Bank and Gaza. Now they have another concern: ""delegitimisation"", what they perceive as a global campaign to ostracise, or boycott, Israel, until it is banished from the family of nations. It is undeniable that Israel has bitter enemies. But the longer the occupation endures, the more Israel risks losing its friends. Netanyahu has to realise that Israel does not have time on its side: it needs to end this conflict – and with the utmost urgency.",Israel has never lacked enemies but now it risks losing its friends | Jonathan Freedland,2010-07-06T20:06:45Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"So Nick Clegg and David Cameron are about to name the date. It seems 5 May 2011 will bring the promised referendum on voting reform – offering the electorate an up-or-down chance to adopt the alternative vote, or AV, system for the Commons. The Liberal Democrats will obviously campaign for a yes vote: this is their baby, with a referendum on AV their chief demand from the Tories in the original coalition negotiations. But for the two largest parties, there's a decision to make. Cameron has set his face against any change to the electoral system: indeed, defence of the current, first-past-the-post setup was one of the Tory leader's constant refrains during the election campaign. Still, there's been some speculation that Cameron might mute his opposition to, or even come out in support of, AV in order to keep his Lib Dem partners happy and on side. This morning Downing Street apparently moved to crush all such talk, insisting that Cameron would campaign against AV. The more pressing dilemma is for Labour. Should they join the Lib Dems in campaigning for a yes vote next May, or should they oppose them, hoping for a referendum defeat that saps Lib Dem morale, depriving the party of its raison d'être for remaining in coalition with the Tories? That decision is part of a wider choice Labour has to make: how should it approach the Liberal Democrats? So far the answer Labour has given has been clear: with unabashed hostility. The most striking aspect of Labour's transition into opposition since May has been the intensity of its focus on the coalition's junior partner. When Harriet Harman gave her spirited response to the budget, it wasn't George Osborne she had in her sights but Lib Dem ministers, who had, she alleged, been ready to sacrifice hundreds of thousands of jobs for the sake of their own. This week leadership contender David Miliband wrote to every Lib Dem MP, urging them to vote against the government's planned VAT rise. That came after brother Ed had dipped into his own campaign coffers to fund a survey showing that 48% of Lib Dem voters were now less inclined to back the party because of the VAT move. When it comes to the Lib Dems, Labour is obsessed. The explanation is not complicated. Labour suspects that disaffected Lib Dems will be the low-hanging fruit of the next election, potential support that is easy to pick off. Labour is eyeing those Lib Dems who thought they were voting on 6 May to keep the Tories out, imagining they'll be on the Labour side next time around. In the meantime, there is a more immediate goal to pursue. If Labour can sow enough discontent in Lib Dem ranks, especially among the parliamentary party, then perhaps the Lib Dems may eventually walk away from the Tories, thereby breaking up the government. No one thinks that's likely any time soon, but Labour can see a potential stress fracture in this coalition – and its job is to increase the stress. There's a last explanation, too: visceral loathing. Many Labour activists hate Lib Dems in a way that might surprise outsiders. That's partly down to local battles, in which the Lib Dems are infamous for their hardball – some would say dirty – tactics. And it's partly down to the narcissism of small difference, with these two parties who once both placed themselves on the centre-left loathing each other more than they loathe the Tories. Labour, lest we forget, is in the middle of a leadership election. The five candidates will have seen on the stump that any attack on Clegg or Vince Cable becomes an immediate applause line. That too is playing its part in amplifying hostilities. But there are dangers here. First, it plays directly into the Tories' hands: the Conservatives' tactic has been to use the Lib Dems as human shields, there to take flak that would otherwise be directed at them. Osborne wants the public to blame Danny Alexander rather than him for spending cuts – and Labour is co-operating in that effort. Second, and more serious, is the risk that all this enmity for the Lib Dems could blind Labour's judgement. AV could be a prime example. Sure, there might be some tactical advantage in opposing it, just to wrongfoot the Lib Dems. But, as many on the left are already arguing, that would be a serious mistake, for reasons of both politics and principle. The politics: campaigning for a no vote would make Labour seem trapped in knee-jerk oppositionism, saying no even to good ideas. Voters would see through it pretty fast. It would also make the party seem backward-looking, defending the status quo. The principle: our current system is all but indefensible and any move – even to the imperfect AV, which is not, admittedly, proportional – is an improvement. So yes, the Lib Dems are an easy target and a tempting one. But that should not blind Labour to its own best interests – and to its real opponent. That's not the Lib Dems, but the Tories. Labour needs to aim less of its fire at the butler – and rather more at the master of the house.",Labour would be wise to lay off the Lib Dem bashing | Jonathan Freedland,2010-07-02T12:04:28Z,Jonathan Freedland,politics
"If the media covered America the way we cover Africa, here's what we would know of the United States over the last decade. That in 2000 there were fiercely disputed elections in which the presidency was seized by the candidate who won fewer votes than his rival. That a year later, one of the country's major cities was rocked by a devastating terror attack, costing thousands of lives. And that in 2005 another key city was submerged in record floods, destroying homes and leaving a thousand dead after the dominant tribe left the minority tribe to their fate. Surely we would speak of America as the dark continent, cursed to face constant suffering. Much as I would like to, I can't claim credit for that riff, which belongs to my Guardian colleague Joseph Harker, who aired it first in an essay on race and the media. But I have been thinking of it, not least because I was a judge for the One World Media awards which were handed out last week. That meant watching and listening to the work of a dozen broadcast journalists and nearly as many in print, all of whom had reported on the developing world. It was a punishingly hard task and not just for the usual reason, cited by all awards judges, that the standard was exceptionally high. It was hard because no matter how good the journalism – and much of it was exceptionally good – it was almost unwatchable. By which I mean it was unbearable to watch. Of course that was partly my fault for consuming these reports the way no punter ever would – back-to-back, one after another. But after an hour or two spent seeing children in Kenya speaking of the hunger that drives them to sell their bodies to European sex tourists, paedophiles who pay £5 to violate a 10- or 11-year-old girl on a beach – or watching footage of mass graves filled with the corpses of civilians murdered in Sri Lanka's 2009 crushing of the Tamils, many of them the small, slight bodies of children – there is only so much you can take. When confronted with the sight of men in Papua New Guinea proudly telling how they tortured and killed those they suspected of witchcraft, or with the image of entire Haitian villages submerged by hurricane-caused floods – even before disaster struck again in this year's earthquake – the urge to look away can be almost overwhelming. The temptation, especially among journalists, is to imagine this is their fault, that if only they made their stories more appealing then they would capture the viewer's or listener's attention. So they try their best to humanise their tale of woe, to replace statistics with an individual. The result can sometimes be achingly powerful: witness the BBC radio interview with a 14-year-old Zimbabwean boy forced to be sole carer for his dying, Aids-stricken mother. Too often, though, this becomes a mere technique in a numbingly repetitive formula: the TV despatch that begins with the crying African baby before cutting to the (usually white) UN expert. Such reports turn all too quickly into cliche, the stuff of Chris Morris parody, and once again the finger is twitching over the television remote. Others say the problem is not one of form but of substance, that the western media depicts the people of the developing world as victims – whether of poverty, natural disaster, corruption or all three. This casts the people of those countries as perennially, even innately, passive – those to whom life happens. It also accentuates the negative in a way that, for all the press's attraction to bad news, does not happen when the west discusses itself: as Harker pointed out, we know more about America than Florida 2000, 9/11 and Katrina. The temptation then is to head in the other direction, to highlight the positive. This was the thrust of Jonathan Dimbleby's recent TV series on Africa, showcasing entrepreneurial and creative success stories – replacing the starving child with the cement billionaire. That's welcome. I confess my heart leapt when I came across one entry to last week's award, a TV report on the effort to build in Timbuktu, Mali, a library of great, pre-colonial manuscripts. An item that was not only upbeat, but also emphasised Africa's intellectual heritage, provided a rare contrast. Yet that cannot be the template for coverage of the developing world. That too would be condescending and would never pass muster for Europe or the US. If we cover scandal, disaster and disease in Germany and France, surely we must do the same in Somalia and Congo. The challenge, of course, is to provide the whole picture – good, bad and ugly. But this challenge cannot fall on journalists alone. The best of the award submissions were about as good as they could be, and still I know the vast bulk of the audience would prefer to read or watch something else. This is partly a problem of all foreign news. Our curiosity about those far away is finite. As one old-time US hack used to say, ""Americans will do anything for Latin America except read about it."" But, more deeply, there seems to be a limit to our capacity to absorb human suffering. We know terrible, heartbreaking things are going on all over the world; but to face them, for more than a fleeting glimpse, is more than we can take. This is true of both ends of the market: sure, Sun readers would prefer to read 10 pages on the World Cup than a single story about TB in Africa, but the Guardian's traffic figures suggest our own online readers are much the same. What might make a difference? Of course, the objective reality could change, and coverage with it. Reporting of the developing world was different in the immediate post-colonial era, when the likes of Julius Nyerere or Kenneth Kaunda were making the weather on their continent. They were active, not passive; actors in their own drama. Too few of the developing world's leaders today meet that standard, whether compromised by corruption or client relationships with the west. Even so, the media does best when it sees the developing world the way it sees its own societies: not as a crude battle of victims against villains but as a subtle mix of conflicting, shifting political interests. A second change might be too much to ask for, especially in these straitened times. It would help if the media's coverage of, say, Africa were more sustained: a steady supply of small, inside-page stories rather than the occasional special, produced by journalists who parachute in and then leave. Audiences can follow quite nuanced reporting on Israel-Palestine, for instance, because they have already had so much of it: they know the characters, can follow the twists and turns. It's a virtuous circle: the more coverage there is, the more interesting it becomes. Perhaps more realistic is to insist these foreign stories are not so foreign. The eventual winner last week was Dan McDougall, who wrote three blistering reports for the Mail on Sunday, all focusing on the world's extractive industries. One showed the consequences of our ravenous appetite for lithium, the mineral used to power our iPods and BlackBerrys: those living around Chile's largest lithium mine are parched, as their water is either poisoned or diverted. McDougall produced similarly eye-popping pieces on the Madagascan mines where the nickel for our coins comes from, and on the badlands of eastern Zimbabwe, where virtual slaves dig for diamonds, jewels that will eventually find their way here. All these reports made the connection between apparently remote suffering and our own lives. This surely is the way to make the unwatchable watchable, to force us to look when we'd rather look away. The burden on the media, and everyone else, is to realise that all this pain is not only going on over there, in the developing world. We're involved – even here, in our world.",We know Rwanda is the story that matters. Yet still we turn to Rooney | Jonthan Freedland,2010-06-29T20:00:29Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"A ""mammoth of research"" is about to rise behind London's St Pancras station, a biomedical centre costing £600m and housing about 1,250 ""cutting-edge"" scientists. Ask not its value. Science jeers at the idea. The UK Centre for Medical Research and Innovation has already been dubbed a ""cathedral of science"", justified by faith, not reason. In which context I turn to the Reith lectures. Each year the dear BBC gestures towards high seriousness by getting a celebrity intellectual to muse in public for four hours. Ennui is relieved with a chatty preamble from the redoubtable Sue Lawley, followed by safe, hand-picked questions and no nasty supplementaries. The whole thing has the air of a Soviet academy. No one does it better than the astronomer and president of the Royal Society, Martin Rees, who concluded the 2010 series this week. Needless to say, he spoke to the BBC's current craze – anything to do with science. The airwaves are crammed with science quizzes, science chatshows, science magazines and science feedback. News must have science stories, the Today programme science items, all reverential. No scepticism is admitted to this new orthodoxy – or rather this revival of CP Snow's ""two cultures"" orthodoxy of the late 1950s. Rees is shameless. After a brisk, familiar canter through the wonder of science – internet, genomes, bugs, space travel – his last lecture brought him to the matter in hand. Science, he said, should ""engage broadly with society and public affairs"". In other words, it should get more money. There is nowhere better to plead for this than on the BBC. We are now shaping up for what, under the Osborne cuts, will be the greatest defensive operation in the history of Britain's professions. Rees will not allow scientists to miss out. He is rightly worried over public anxiety at the more disreputable antics of his colleagues. It was too bad that the Icelandic ash clouds turned out to be not as bad as ""the science"" had claimed. It was too bad if science banned beef on the bone; too bad if science wasted £2bn on Tamiflu; too bad if science wrecked the case for nuclear power by its hypersafe radiation limits, or failed properly to defend GM foods. These, by implication, were the fault of politicians for taking science too literally. To Rees, ""the advance of science spares us from irrational dread"", and if science replaced irrational dread with an exaggerated fear of risk, that also is just too bad. Since science supplies its own ""organised scepticism"", its claims on the public purse should be asserted as infallible. Cathedrals are no place for question marks. The Times ran a supplement before the election suggesting a ""pro-science"" MP was more important than any party, like ""pro-life"" candidates in America. To criticise science teaching is little short of blasphemy. Above all, science should be seen as above money. To Rees, a science grant is like an arts grant, a virtue beyond measure. In his lecture he insulted the financial sector as ""not the real world"", as ""faffing around with derivatives"" and as undeserving of any graduate's respect. (Yet within minutes Rees was moaning that in Britain there was not enough ""venture capital for startups"".) The giveaway was a questioner who doubted the value of the Large Hadron Collider, on a par with aircraft carriers and Olympic games for useless extravagance. Rees stuck to the party line that forbids him to say that £7bn and ""thousands of scientists"" buried under a Swiss mountain might have been better employed on energy research. Politicians must show a sense of ""priorities and perspectives"", he said, but scientists do not do priorities. They just want money. Rees is part of the lobby that led to the fiasco of the late 1980s, when colossal resources were devoted by the former Tory education secretary Lord Baker and others to maths and science education. They said it should form two thirds of the so-called core curriculum. Grants for science teaching soared. History and geography were demoted. University courses were expanded and colleges received twice as much grant for a science place as for an arts one. By 1993, when the policy had been in place for a whole secondary school cohort, it had utterly failed. Demand for science GCSE and A-level had fallen by 10%. University science labs lay empty as entry requirements fell to E-grades. Yet a plummeting market for science graduates left government targets unchanged. A body called Save British Science castigated the ""shocking underpayment"" of scientists, even as it demanded that schools turn out ever more of them. It was a classic policy failure that passes unaudited, by government, by politics or by academia. The science lobby reacted by turning itself into a religion. If economics could not justify its priority, then faith should do so. Men such as Rees and his colleague, Lord May, became archbishops preaching the word, that: ""Britain needs more scientists."" Their canticle was: ""More money for research."" Other vocational subjects such as law, accountancy and finance were deplored, even as the jobs market screamed for them. Unfashionable science-based occupations such as nursing and pharmacology had to burgle poor countries for staff. Rees is two-faced about this talent theft. Facing the accusation that science steals bright graduates from poorer countries, he suggests that they should ""fulfil their potential without emigrating"", perhaps by Britain securing them ""less dispiriting conditions"" back home. He wants a collider in every kraal. Yet he promotes just such theft. He wants more money or Britain's ""success in attracting mobile talent will be at risk"". Unless we continue to attract and nurture foreigners, we will ""not retain international competitiveness"". Less cash would jeopardise the nation's status in ""the international premier league"". It would damage Britain's ""standing"", its ""leverage"", indeed, the very ""sustainability of its society"". This is big science, like big defence, dressing in the clothes of the League of Empire Loyalists. When a lobby is in full cry, no quarter is given to reason. If science is so international, why see it in such chauvinist terms? Why not let less-privileged countries share in the global talent? Besides, science is all on the internet. A virtue of back-to-basics in public finance is that it might strip the cliches about ""vital for the nation's interest"" from the log-rolling. Every lobby is going into action to defend its subsidies. Scargill's miners were nothing to what we shall see from the scientists, doctors, lawyers, farmers, sportsmen and, above all, generals. They will turn on government as never before, claiming exemption from cuts in the cause of national pride and prosperity. When pain is expected of every corner of the public sector, no claim to public money should escape scrutiny. Those intending to live off the earnings of others should always have to explain why. I share Rees's glory in the wonder of science. I wish the wonder could be taught in schools, which still prefer to be kindergartens for lab technicians. But science research is one lobby among many. The BBC should not lavish it with favours against less-fashionable claimants for its platforms. One thing is for sure, Rees's subsidies must come from taxes on the professions he most despises – banking and finance. I bet no one devotes a research grant or a Reith lecture to them.","Martin Rees paints science as religion, so his bishops can gather their annual tithe | Simon Jenkins",2010-06-24T20:30:06Z,Simon Jenkins,politics
"Dave said to put in something about this historic speech he did saying our whole way of life would have to change, before he forgets. Actually it was amazing – I looked round while he was practising and thought God that's so true, soon all this will be totally unrecognisable. It already is, a bit, since I hid everything except the bath under neutral throws from Mummy's. Makes it hard to find things though.

"A report published this week by the thinktank Demos argues that supermarket chains should get tax incentives to open stores in those parts of Britain – parts that may be about to increase – which stand isolated by their poverty and dilapidation. Not only do supermarkets offer employment; according to Demos, they also give poor neighbourhoods easy access to cheap but good food, raise community morale and can transform how a place is seen in the outside world. In other words, no matter how much a prosperous country town in East Anglia might detest the coming of Tesco, in neglected Birmingham districts such as Castle Vale and Balsall Heath (where Demos did its research) supermarkets are doing the Lord's work. Among the ruins of British high streets this is a controversial position. The Lord's outlets grow in number every week. At the last count Tesco owned 2,492 stores in Britain, took £1 in every £7 spent by British consumers, and at 30.7% had double the market share of its nearest rival, Asda. It employs more workers than any other private company, takes annual revenue (£62.5bn last year) larger than many countries' budgets, and has expanded aggressively abroad – 2,329 stores and counting – as well as into businesses remote from the grocery trade. Tesco is building a series of ""mini-villages"" in east London and Kent. Quite soon you will be able to buy a Tesco house through a Tesco estate agent on a Tesco mortgage, and furnish it from Tesco store on a Tesco credit card. If the name were ""Govco"" or ""Youco"" and the profits went to the public purse, there would be no end of protest about state monopoly and oppression. Tesco comes from a different strand in our social history. In the 1920s a London street trader, Jack Cohen, developed a particularly successful line in tea, which was supplied by TE Stockwell of Messrs Torring and Stockwell of Mincing Lane. To brand it, Cohen added the first three letters of his supplier's name to the first two of his own. His first two shops opened in 1931 and by 1939 there were 100. Cohen worked on thin profit margins to keep his prices cheap; he depended on maximum turnover. The formula has served Tesco ever since, though the bigger it grew the more confident it became to bear down on the prices charged by the producer, which in turn made the producer look at his costs; a cheap chicken bought in a poor part of Birmingham is not necessarily good news for the East Anglian chicken farmer, or, when alive, for the chicken. There are several stores near me, as there are almost certainly near you. I never go. I have other shops, independent traders that often keep late hours, and I'd like them to survive. Supporters of Tesco often describe this kind of boycott as ""typically middle class"", meaning that it comes from people rich or foolish enough to pay more for the same cabbage, and with a sentimental view of community. I also note in myself that the ban isn't always applied to Sainsbury's and to Waitrose never at all. Snobbery as well as righteousness may be at work. Alan Bennett, in one of his Talking Heads, describes a sad 65-year-old called Leonard: ""He's been had up for exposing himself in Sainsbury's doorway. As Mother said, 'Tesco, you could understand …'"" Certainly, opposition to Tesco is always stronger where people have more money: in the south more than the north, in desirable towns that have good butchers' shops rather than ex-industrial settlements with a Costcutter on the corner. A new Tesco opened a year or two ago in Port Glasgow: a ""Tesco Extra"", which in the taxonomy of Tesco's evangelical mission is a cathedral rather than a church (""Tesco Superstore"") or a wayside pulpit (""Tesco Express""). So far as I can tell, it prompted no serious protest, though Tesco has two other stores only two miles away in Greenock. But then these Clydeside towns face problems even greater than Castle Vale and Balsall Heath. After shipbuilding ended in the 1980s, about 18,000 people left them – a population decline of 18%. Another 14% are expected to leave in the next 15 years and a higher than average proportion of those who remain will be old and poor. Who would spurn Tesco and its promise of jobs in these circumstances? The store lies near the Clyde on the site of Lithgow's shipyard, close to the little church where my cousins got married and near a mounted replica of Henry Bell's Comet, which was launched nearby in 1812 to become Britain's first sea-going steamship. I spent several childhood holidays here and it is bewildering to remember how the sights and noises of those years – swinging cranes, riveters drilling, the crackle of welding torches – have been replaced by the icy calm of a long, low white building surrounded by a car park. A town that depended for its prosperity on production is now a town that gets by on consumption. How's it done? How does the consumer make the money that buys the produce which includes, according to an online comment on the Tesco Port Glasgow site, 20 different kinds of milk? I asked a friend who used to be a social worker there what people did for a living. ""Oh, they work in Tesco's,"" she said. A closed system then, round and round, as though Britain had discovered the economic equivalent of perpetual motion. But now that happy era of wishful thinking is drawing to its miserable close, Demos may find a flaw in its proposition. Supermarkets may well provide jobs to a blighted area, make it more confident, help reduce its stigma. But supplies of money are finite and about to shrink. Fifty jobs in supermarket A means 50 or more jobs fewer in high street B; the blighted areas themselves are likely to get poorer rather than richer; outsiders, also feeling the pinch, will think twice before spending money on the petrol. Already, what used to be thought of as the shopping streets of Port Glasgow and Greenock are empty of most traders other than pubs and tan parlours. I remember going with my cousins to the Maypole shop, where assistants took your money and sent it to the counting house via polished metal containers that shot over your head on wires. The Maypole chain made their original fortune out of cheap margarine and began to suffer when margarine lost the contest with butter. Their shops made fortunes for their owners and featured on high streets into the 1960s. Now gone, every one. Tesco looks impregnable, but hubris can be smelt in its relentless advance. Its US venture is losing money; when Sir Terry Leahy resigned this week as chief executive, shares fell 3%; the name will never be lovable. These are its years in the sun, but all thing pass. One day Tesco will join Maypole's miniature cable cars in the museum of shopkeeping. ""The Great Cornucopian Age,"" the label will say underneath a model of the Port Glasgow store. ""Food was sourced globally and transported by carbon-rich fuel. Even in this small town in western Scotland, mangoes could be bought cheaply whatever the season and there were 20 different kinds of milk.""

"If you want an insight into the power pyramid of Hollywood, you only have to look at the heat Michael Winterbottom is getting for the graphic violence against females in his film of Jim Thompson's 1952 novel, The Killer Inside Me. Then look at how actresses Jessica Alba and Kate Hudson are barely mentioned, certainly not held culpable, as if they weren't professionals in charge of their own destiny, rather, poseable dolls, happily helpless in the director's hands. What price progress, ladies? Say what you like about Linda Lovelace, but didn't she have to be drugged into making Deep Throat. Winterbottom deserves the heat – this could have been a modern noir classic (Casey Affleck as the psychopath sheriff is excellent). Winterbottom is also too good a film-maker to be relying on the crude visuals of Alba's face being remorselessly punched to the point where it (crunchily) collapses or lingeringly to depict a beaten Hudson, whimpering, urinating all over the floor. Both victims are still masochistically ""in love"" with Affleck, even as they die. Many of Thompson's females come across as dark-hued Jessica Rabbits, but surely it was Winterbottom's job to flesh them out. His excuse for the extreme violence (it's ""more moral"") is especially lame, considering that the violence towards males in the film includes a couple of quick shootings and an off-screen hanging. No ""morality"" to be had there, then? Cinematic violence involving women is a staple rather than a novelty. It seems like only yesterday that Charlotte Gainsbourg was lopping off her clitoris in Lars Von Trier's Antichrist. To be fair, both Winterbottom and Von Trier have shown violence towards men in their films. In fact, this furore raises questions about cinema violence per se. Do we just notice violence involving women more? Would equal opportunities violence solve the problem? If children were to replace women as victims, would people realise how much of it there is? All of this could be endlessly debated. However, no one seems to ask – what about actress integrity? Even if directors want to film such scenes, where are the actresses' objections? We all know the arguments for it not being easy for actresses. High unemployment, rampant industry sexism, very few decent parts, especially for older women, and the rest. However, Alba and Hudson are hardly struggling. Indeed, it's often successful actresses who accept these roles, going on to trill about the ""immense privilege"" of working with the director. In no other sphere are performers so routinely happy to just play along – look at Chloë Sevigny giving an unsimulated blowjob in Brown Bunny? Such a scene, curiously enough, wasn't deemed necessary between the male leads in Brokeback Mountain. So, from over-graphic sex to over-graphic violence. Go girls! If this wasn't so ugly it would almost be funny – a cinematic replay of the Kenny Everett ""It's all done in the best possible taste!"" character. Indeed, if Alba and Hudson are feeling relieved that Winterbottom is receiving all the aggro, perhaps they should ask themselves: ""What does it say that I am not being attacked?"" There lies the key. First, a successful actress is not a helpless pawn, so it seems astonishing that big names cannot make a stand and refuse to participate in the more obviously gratuitous scenes, instead of playing along, and later wittering abut the director's ""vision"", in the manner of celluloid groupies. Moreover, in this case, Alba and Hudson are world-renowned actresses commanding millions a movie. Why then do they find themselves in a situation where the director, Winterbottom, is being attacked because frankly he is considered worth attacking – he is deemed important enough to be held responsible, to be guilty – while they, despite the fact that it's them shown having their faces and bladders bashed in, clearly are not? Don't step on George's toes, Vince  Is there a medical cream available, something fast acting, for soothing the incredible irritation caused by Vince Cable? The latest nonsense is him wanting to rename his Business, Innovation and Skills department as the Department for Economic Affairs, which is believed to be both a power grab and a sign to George Osborne that he considers himself his equal. Oh dear. This kind of tiring, grandstanding Carry On Coalition activity is exactly why many people, even some Labour voters, would have preferred a straight win by the Tories. The Lib Dems seem to be behaving like the party of low self-esteem, constantly wailing for assurances that they are valued and important: ""Do you love us, David, do you really?"" Cable is emerging as one of the worst. Why do I keep seeing him pontificating in the papers? Why isn't he holed up somewhere, busy with the deficit? It's been said that Cable is the most likely to resign first because of his principles. Really? If his principles were that important he wouldn't be there in the first place. Nor would he be fretting over the exact title of his department. The public couldn't care less what it's called (Utopia? Neverland?) as long as the job is done. All these desperate attempts to look his own man will result in… what exactly? Changing some government stationary. Brilliant. Cable is pushing for something he doesn't deserve. The Conservatives won hundreds more seats than the Lib Dems and all the face-saving about ""parallel departments"" and ""partnerships"" doesn't change that. Put bluntly, Cable is not Osborne's equal. If anything, he's fortunate that he's not been assigned to bring George's morning cup of tea, with a tasty Garibaldi on the saucer. What happened to rock'n'roll footballers? It's intriguing to learn about the England football squad's flight to South Africa: games, puzzles, noise-cancelling headphones. Wayne Rooney took a special music pillow, because he can't sleep in silence. He also likes to sleep on the floor of the plane because the vibrations lull him to sleep. Has he tried the wings of the plane? One hears they also vibrate rather a lot. This is mortifying, the football equivalent of keeping a bunch of toddlers occupied. The only things missing are Tweenies sticker books and Cheestrings. One hopes the other passengers weren't kept awake by screaming babies, namely the England players, because some of them wanted to play pat-a-cake and the cabin crew were too busy spoonfeeding their team-mates pureed carrots. Didn't George Best prepare for big matches with a slug of champagne and a tenner to the latest Miss World for a taxi? Not that this approach was exactly ideal, but they'd better rush-release all those World Cup singles, because this precious behaviour doesn't bode well.

"When interviewed on Friday about the oil spill ravaging the Gulf of Mexico, an American oceanographer, Professor Ian MacDonald, had a question of his own. What, he asked Evan Davis, was BP's Tony Hayward – ""a lord, or a duke, or a knight or .... ?"" Nothing short of hereditary privilege, he intimated, could explain the level of idiot condescension to which his country had recently been subjected, courtesy of BP's chief executive. Although the professor was, of course, having fun at Hayward's expense, it is a shame to think of its being rooted in a common perception, overseas, about the nature of British democracy. I have checked, naturally, to establish that Hayward is not a contemporary Pimpernel, concealing his rank from the scientific community: his plebeian credentials are impeccable. The most he could ever hope to be is a plain life peer, allowing his children to style themselves ""the Honourable"". Do they not stock Debrett's in American oceanography departments? The familiar, Wodehousean caricature is as depressing, surely, as Hollywood's habitual use of RP to signal depravity. For no matter how traditional this country might appear in some respects, with the Queen and her coachmen still accessorising progressive agendas for change – there can be no question, nowadays, of a lord or a duke being put in charge of something as important as BP simply because he is a lord or a duke. Although, as the collapse of Northern Rock once demonstrated, there is no actual law against this. Hence the Duke of York's continuing efforts for the economy. Not forgetting those of his former wife. A risk, perhaps, yet all too often these figureheads are unqualified for any other work. Is it so surprising, after generations in the care of aristocrats, that we should want to return the favour, providing jobs for unemployable dukes and housing for otherwise homeless lords? If that sounds improbable, consider how many commoners give generously to the National Trust, a charity that is still, explicitly, dedicated to keeping superfluous aristocrats in their old country houses. Just one National Trust subscription, apparently, buys a jug of gin and french for a peer who is thereby relieved of living expenses. Five buys lunch for his prize pig. Ten subscriptions and you guarantee the insurance of his ancestral quarters for at least 20 minutes. The benefits to aristocratic self-esteem are beyond calculation. As David Cannadine said in his 1990 study, The Decline and Fall of the British Aristocracy: ""It is the saving and the upkeep of the great house that is the all-consuming object of aristocratic existence."" However, as the Duke of Devonshire pointed out more recently, their remaining status derives from politics, too. Only when (as seemed imminent a few months ago) the hereditaries were booted out of the House of Lords would the game be up. ""Then it would be clear-cut what the people wanted,"" the duke said, ""and it would be confusing to maintain hereditary titles."". But, thanks to Tory resistance prior to the election and, now, to the invigorating impact of Clegg and Cameron, the hereditaries are safe again. The continuing degradation of the placemen, with Brown's elevation of Alan Sugar already eclipsed by the arrival of the toff-hating secretary romancer Lord Prescott, with scores of Tory plutocrats to follow, has also diverted attention from a set-up which, if Liam Fox ever gets to hear about it, he will rightly characterise as broken and 13th century. Last week, for example, the removal of child trust funds was announced to the upper house by the Conservative whip Rupert Ponsonby, 7th Baron de Mauley, who appears to have been a territorial Army officer before being transformed into a full-time, medieval-style legislator, following his selection in a byelection of Tory hereditaries. It is Labour's system for replacing dead hereditaries, so as to keep their living number steady at 92 (with party ratios as they stood in 1999), that now allows this rump to boast that it is more democratic, in its funny sort of way, than the appointed majority. By coincidence, the day the American oceanographer was mocking dukes and lords was also the deadline for dukes and lords to put themselves forward at the next hereditary byelections, for one Tory and one crossbencher. Any hereditary peer who is a) legitimate and b) able to write his name on a register of interested aristocrats is free to nominate himself (this is primogeniture, you understand, not prejudice) for either or both of these vacancies, no previous or current interest in politics being necessary. Traditionally, the political world responds to these democratic events, perhaps appropriately, by ignoring them. This year, however, the vogue for political reform may finally prompt some interest. One of the problems with AV, the system used in Lords byelections, is thought to be voter confusion. British proles may get so flummoxed, it is feared, that they do something called ""donkey voting"" whereby candidate ranking follows the ballot paper's, rather than political preference. But its critics forget that, unlike PR, the AV electoral system has now been tested, repeatedly, on 92 individuals whose average IQ is thought to be somewhat lower than that of a Wodehouse character described as having ""just about enough intelligence to open his mouth when he wanted to eat, but certainly no more"". That, so far, every byelection has gone without a hitch indicates that the system of AV is not merely within the intellectual grasp of British commoners, it promises democracy, one day, for British crustacea. How, sceptics will ask, can we be sure that no butlers have assisted hereditaries who might otherwise have struggled in the voting booths? Because, of course, most of the relevant peers gravitate towards the Laws precisely because they cannot afford heating, let alone staff. More pertinent, surely, is the objection that, in the hereditary context, donkey-voting and the exercise of political choice are indistinguishable. What does it matter who they choose? As the 13th Earl Ferrers reminded the House in the spring, after it neutered Straw's reforms: ""Hereditary peers have not been appointed by anyone other than the Almighty."" But credit, please, where it's due: they were saved, last week, by the New Politics. Within days of Clegg announcing that the mightiest reforms ever made would soon be smiting these luxuriously accommodated agents of unelected power, there came the announcement of yet another luckless committee to accompany the creation of an army of Cameron recruits to ""balance"" an institution where, if the past is any guide, a lifelong democrat can be turned within 15 minutes of first being called ""my Lord"". After an hour or so, he can recite, along with the hereditaries: ""The strange thing is, it works."" Yes, titles, placemen, bishops, dukes, viscounts, halfwits, lobbyists, Jeffrey Archer, phoney overnight allowances, Ashcroft, primogeniture, Prescott and all. As Lord St John of Fawsley exulted last week: ""It is a modern miracle.""

"The future of Europe is in the balance. The potential disintegration of the euro will be a first-order economic and political disaster. Economically, it will plunge Europe into competitive devaluations, debt defaults, bank bailouts, frozen credit flows, trade protection and prolonged stagnation. Politically, whatever resolve there is to hold our disparate continent together, where the old enmities and suspicions are never far from the surface, will evaporate. The Eurosceptics will have got what they wanted – a Europe of independent nation states looking after their own interests. But there is a dark side to Europe. What will be ushered in won't be a joyful common market bound together by wealth generating trade. What will emerge will be a Europe closer to the 1930s. Fearful, stagnant and prey to vicious racist and nationalist ideologies. Europe is our continent and our biggest trading partner. If it falls, it brings Britain down too. On Friday, the rating agency Fitch downgraded Spanish debt, despite Madrid's austerity plan to halve the budget deficit in 12 months. What worries Fitch is that Spain now has no plausible way to grow, even as over the next two-and-half years it has to persuade savers at home and abroad to buy £375bn (€440bn) of government debt. Spain's problem is not so much the annual budget deficit, serious though that is. What makes its crisis close to unmanageable is that it has been so cavalier in the past about the structure of its cumulative national debt. Like Lehman Brothers and Royal Bank of Scotland, it has borrowed short term, assuming that as a member of the eurozone there would always be buyers for its euro-denominated bonds. Lehman had to refinance its entire trillion-dollar balance sheet every few months; Spain has to refinance half its national debt every three years. When confidence is high, it's easy; when confidence disappears, it is impossible. Confidence has now gone. Bond investors see a swamp of never-ending debt created by a country locked in recession. Worse, the government's need for financing could climb even higher as it bails out its stricken banks. Bond investors are going on strike. The European Union at a crisis meeting two weeks ago set up a £640bn (€750bn) fund to which countries such as Spain could turn if they could not sell their government debt to the markets. Spain, with Ireland, Portugal and Greece, could run through all that money within 24 months. The EU also agreed that as a last resort the European Central Bank could print euros and buy eurozone government debts – what Latin-American countries habitually do. Germany, forced into accepting these last-ditch measures in order to save the euro, is looking on with horror. It was the Reichsbank printing money that created hyperinflation and led, in part, to national socialism. Now, the European Central Bank is about to embark on the same course. What the European Union is turning into is a ""transfer union"" complains Chancellor Angela Merkel, echoing her right-wing tabloid press, taking money from hard-working Germans to bail out feckless Greeks, Spaniards and Portuguese. Worse, the protections Germany thought it had written into the Maastricht treaty to ensure that the euro would be the hard currency successor to the deutschmark turn out to be useless. European governments have a matter of months – maybe weeks – to find a way of making the euro a credible currency, installing some long-term discipline into the way European banks do business and European governments organise their budgets and, above all, offering a way for the continent to raise its terrible low growth rate. Otherwise, the markets are going to refuse to buy euro debt and the rancour between Germany, its supporters and the rest will bring the whole edifice down. There are some good ideas. Create a European monetary fund that will police member states' budgets and organise short-term transfers between member states. It will try to ensure that countries such as Germany running trade surpluses expand their economies and those who do not tighten their belts. There should be a simple system of European bank regulation to ensure that all European banks conform to the same rules. Deepen and extend the single market so there is more opportunity for Europe's businesses. And so on . All are stillborn. The trouble is that all these solutions involve more Europe, not less, and Europe's political leaders, especially the Germans, are not in the market for more Europe. The Germans have issued their own stern, unbending, nine-point plan. Over-borrowed countries such as Spain or Greece should in extremis leave the euro. Governments which flout the rules to keep budget deficits low should pay enormous fines and lose voting rights in all EU matters for 12 months. Countries such as Germany which have trade surpluses should not be compelled to do anything. Europeans, in short, need to become more German and if they don't, they should leave the EU. European Commission President Barroso has said the ideas will involve changes to the European treaties that are inconceivable. The only way forward, he thinks, is Germany finding a way to make common cause in creating more Europe. Germany, I think, can't move. Recently, it passed a law making it a constitutional requirement to balance its budget for every year after 2016. There is an army of German constitutional lawyers who intend to hold it to account and who also believe that joining the euro was unconstitutional. All Germany can do is to insist the rest of Europe becomes more like it, which, economically, is hard to imagine. Not everybody can build a manufacturing export machine. Somebody has to be an importer. In any case, economic policy in the aftermath of a credit crunch and the colossal overhang of private debt has to be much more imaginative and risk-taking than anything Germany would contemplate. There is no painless route out of a credit crunch; growth is only an option if every other country is growing and that's not on offer. Otherwise, the choices are stagnation, debt deflation or inflation. The least bad option, as the IMF's chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, has recently argued, is a modest and targeted increase in inflation. He suggests an inflation target of 4%. This is what we will have to do in Britain. It is also what would save the euro. Germany will soon have to decide what it wants – a hard currency and a broken Europe or a compromised currency and a Europe that holds together. It is a decision that will affect all our lives and I'm not optimistic that Germany will make the right choice.","If Germany can't stop the collapse of European hopes, who can? | Will Hutton",2010-05-29T23:04:12Z,Will Hutton,world
"I should not be surprised if it was discovered that the 1960s children's TV series about Robinson Crusoe led to the first great surge in support for Scottish nationalism. We had to wait several weeks for the first episode, as the BBC screened the series to coincide with English school summer holidays which commenced later than our own. And then, just as things began to get interesting as big Robinson and Man Friday discover they are not alone, it was time for us to return to our classes. Perhaps the old castaway's experiences on his desert island also subliminally affected the desire of so many of his fellow Scots to embrace the solitary life. How else are we to explain the revelation last week that by 2018 more than a million of us will live on our own? I bow to no one in my admiration for the many qualities of my fellow nationals. But I also concur with Wodehouse's observation that it is never difficult to mistake a Scot with a grievance for a ray of sunshine. As such, the prospect of a million solitary Scots living up closes does not engender feelings of optimism. I recently joined them and immediately discovered two things: it is indeed a jungle out there and Chinese laundries do exist. Two weeks into my plus-one existence and already I am wondering if I ought to qualify for a home help or at least a carer of some description. For it would appear that over the course of the years I may have developed an immunity to the modern world. It must have happened by stealth or else people just didn't tell me what the hell was actually going on out there. Already the ironing board, washing machine and shower head have joined forces to intimidate and undermine me. Purely as a precaution I have already sought out the location of the nearest hospital burns unit and have helpfully supplied the staff there with all my personal details and my blood group. Over the course of my previous life, I never exhibited even the slightest aptitude for machinery or gadgets. This malady is now having a knock-on effect and I am becoming alarmed at little things that I was once accustomed to performing without any assistance at all. Just the other day, I saw a lollipop lady and found myself soliciting her help to negotiate the traffic. This alteration of my circumstances has also coincided with me taking delivery of an iPhone, a little beast that appears to be possessed by poltergeists.

"The price of cheddar is going to go up by 10% over the next six months. This is quite a rare food story, now, in terms of price rises: it's localised; it pertains directly to British weather conditions (too wet – cows don't like it); it feels containable, finite. This makes it a marked contrast to the general run of agricultural stories, which foretell total disaster. The UN this week made its report, tangentially about food, foreseeing price hikes, shortages and wars, all plausible consequences of the world's failure to halt biodiversity loss. This issue was widely reported in 2007-08, but global recessions are at least good for something, and the spike in food prices fell back. As the economy picks back up, so does the cost of feeding yourself. When even the cheese-eating developed world is hit, things are much worse in developing countries. Studies in 2008 yielded some data on the impact of expensive food: not just the obvious results, some people starving, some people substituting cheaper, lower-quality nutrition; children are taken out of school; people go without medicine (a particular problem in countries with high rates of HIV); in urban areas there are riots. So I was a bit surprised to read the ad for MoneyWeek magazine which gave, in its list of helpful features, ""How to profit from higher food prices"". It's just so bald, isn't it? This phenomenon, both directly and indirectly, has already killed people and will kill many more. In India, lentil prices have tripled since 2008; urban families typically spend 55% of their income on food. Even if gambling on food insecurity weren't likely to destabilise the situation further (and it is), it would still be a little bit tasteless, wouldn't it? You'd never see Homes and Gardens running a story on what genius bargains you get when people's homes get repossessed, or Elle passing on fat-busting tips discovered by chance in a refugee camp. I called MoneyWeek for a comment, but Wednesday is their busy day. I'm sure they wouldn't have been embarrassed. Capitalists capitalise – it's what they do. They never pretend to have a moral compass, they're proud of their amorality. Nevertheless, the market – in the shape of business leaders, interpreted by city analysts – retains a bearing of authority. It presents itself in loco parentis over the childish hubbub of politics; bankers and ""business leaders"" pass judgment on what kind of government would suit them best. On what basis could anyone without morality claim authority over anything? Traditionally, on the basis that they are perfectly rational: that, free of morality (which is a passion of sorts), they are liberated from the heat of the human condition and can make cool, predictable, logical decisions. Each player may be unashamedly motivated by self-interest, but self-interest will at least assure stability, since chaos serves no one. That would be some consolation if it were true, but we don't even need to look back a year to see what hogwash it is. Markets panic, and that alone makes them dangerous. Even worse is this behaviour, described by Chuck Prince, former CEO of Citigroup: ""As long as the music is playing, you've got to get up and dance,"" he said in 2007, justifying the overleveraged loans his bank was still making, when the financial crisis was looming like King Kong. They're not in the least bit rational, these people – or they simply accept that if their position runs counter to what peers and competitors are doing, that in itself makes it irrational. The crash and its causes all gave an insight into herd behaviour, but the whole caper is delinquent, manic and riotous: it's like some kind of penis panic (you might have to look that up). It's been de rigeur since 2008 to talk about ""greedy bankers"". That doesn't really do it, though – greed is a broad and inadequate explanation for the bizarre spectacle of a cohort that is proud of its own unscrupulousness, amused by its own hysteria and yet self-righteous and unshakeable in its demands for political influence and respect. Even greedy people value consistency: very few people have no scruples at all. I've come reluctantly to the conclusion that the problem is not the busted humanity of the people themselves but the process of engaging with financial markets. It divides people from themselves. It voids their sense of shame, and even the magazines that serve them are shameless. The pursuit of money has to be undertaken with no rules: if you want to be a human being afterwards, fine, give the money away – but in the making of it, you're basically a wolf. The whole business is not dissimilar to stepping into a driving seat. The bonds of community and etiquette dissolve. That's why we have a Highway Code. You don't need to be told not to ram into the back of people when you're walking. Item one, then, for a Market Highway Code: when people across the world are struggling to keep up with the spiralling cost of staying alive, maybe try not to skim some money off the top.

"Some of you may not be aware of Football Factory actor, and TV presenter, Danny Dyer, who appeared to give the following advice to a reader who wrote in to his Zoo magazine column about missing his ex: ""I'd suggest going on the rampage with the boys, getting on the booze and smashing everything that moves. Then when some bird falls for you, you can turn the tables and break her heart. Of course, the other option is to cut your ex's face, and then no one will want her."" In the ensuing furore, ant- domestic violence and women's groups were rightly horrified. Dyer, who like many celebrity-columnists gave his contributions via phone interview, insisted he was ""misquoted"" and ""devastated"". Zoo blamed it on a ""production error"" and donated money to Women's Aid. Zoo also cancelled Dyer's page, saying it would be devoted this week to ""driving awareness to the issue of violence against women"". Hmmm, how would that go? ""Oi geezers, don't slash or bash your bird or nuffink, or she won't be hot no more, innit?"" Elsewhere, the prevailing attitude seemed to be: ""What does anyone expect from the lads' mag market, that repellent pornographic haven for the casually misogynistic, otherwise known as 'Loaded culture', after the magazine that started it all?"" I'll have to stop you there. Whatever just happened at Zoo, it's a toxic nasty new world away from original Loaded culture. I worked for Loaded when it was first started by James Brown and Tim Southwell. I was proud to, and still find the ""tits and ass"" porn-for-people-who-daren't-buy-porn reductionism it is often lumbered with, lazy and snide. This was not what Loaded was about. Yes, there was t&a, but weirdly far less than legend dictates. The keynotes were humour, sex, love, sport, culture, travel, male icons, male idiocy, goddess worship, chaos, ""stuff"". For its sins (""Phwoar!"" ""Cor!""), Loaded pulled off the groundbreaking male publishing act of making friends of their readers, celebrating the lives they had, their ""ordinary bloke-hood"", instead of goading them about the alpha lives they didn't have. People sigh about Laddism now, with some justification. However, back then, Loaded culture burst an important psychic boil. In terms of male liberation, it was nothing short of revolutionary to undermine that self-hating male message that if their lives weren't all about Rolexes and duplexes, stress and success, they were nothing. Whatever the snobs said, Loaded culture gave the ordinary struggling male back his spine and heart. Crucially, during my time at Loaded, women were routinely worshipped, or viewed as better than men (for putting up with them). Which explains why I get so shocked when the spectre of Loaded culture is dragged into incidents such as these. The thought of Brown, Southwell, or indeed any of the people who worked for the original title, sitting around talking about cutting up women's faces, or finding acceptable any kind of nastiness towards females, is surreal beyond belief. The resting Loaded vibe was somewhere between Dennis Hopper and Sid James, not Ted Bundy and Son of Sam. Which might not be true of some of its imitators now, but what's that got to do with it? Clearly there are now magazines out there that resemble the cheap porno equivalent of those lurid photo-menus bad cafes have of fry-ups, and read like the Mein Kampf of misogyny. What they don't have is any connection with the original Loaded spirit. Maybe another shake up of the male magazine industry is needed? Certainly, while Loaded revolutionised this market, it cannot be blamed for, or deemed synonymous with, what came next. So, no, for me, the Zoo face-cutting ""gag"" is not (press cliche button) ""What I'd expect from Loaded culture"", not as it was originally intended anyway. It seems to me that, over 15 years on, people should be able to accept that there is a big difference between ""laddism"" and misogyny. One was a British cultural revolution back in the mid-1990s, the other always sucked. The original Loaded knew the difference – why don't the rest of us? Nick Clegg? I miss Charles Kennedy Grisly levels of gloating over the cornflakes chez Ellen on Friday morning. It was delicious to see Nick Clegg receive his comeuppance for being what I believe is technically known as a ""cocky arse"". Clegg-mania? For some of us, Clegg was the political equivalent of one of those opportunistic guys who swoop when you've fallen out with your boyfriend. And so it came to pass that all that ""Pah … these two!"" hamming to camera didn't fly with the voters. Probably the only person more pleased than me was Charles Kennedy. Well, I say probably. Maybe this is projection, but surely Kennedy wouldn't be human not to feel a secret warm glow at these results. It feels astonishing now that Kennedy was kicked out as Lib Dem leader because of a private drinking problem. Now the Lib Dems are confronted with Clegg's all-too-public ""flunking problem"". All that publicity, that huge push, the media hand-holding and they still come in third, with fewer seats than they had before. Clegg led them like the dad who didn't think to empty out the potatoes for the school sack race. The Lib Dems deserve better. Let's hope this means the return of Kennedy, the Lib Dem even non-Lib Dems felt they could relate to, just as Kenneth Clarke has always been the Tory non-Tories could relate to. Let's face it, the Liberal Democrats could hardly have done any worse if Kennedy circa 2005 had mumbled and sweated a bit during those live debates. Or, for that matter, swigged back a dram and sung a sea shanty. Come back, Charlie. All is most definitely forgiven.

Her show in Rome is the latest to be slated on an ill-fated tour beset with complaints, mockery and demands for money back. As a Whitney fan, it's plain that she's not what she was. I've winced at clips of her ""singing"" live, with her thumb seemingly jammed in an invisible car door. Nor is she as lithe and gorgeous as she was in her youth. Then again, who is? At her peak, Houston was a true talent – with a vocal range that made Mariah Carey sound as if she was being attacked by killer bees. But her drug-strewn fall in the past doesn't mean she does not deserve respect for the musical force she once was. Nor our compassion. Indeed, with Houston's apparent ""situation"" all over the press, one has to wonder why people persist in buying tickets for her shows and then complain. My guess is that it's for the sport of denigrating this poor woman, in what amounts to a disgusting spectacle of showbiz bear-baiting. Let's hope these people don't get a penny back.

"This weekend and the days ahead are moments of high decision for the Liberal Democrats – the playmakers in British politics – and for the future of the state and the country. Beneath the self-serving blather about mandates and national interest lies a question much more raw. The negotiations are about marshalling the votes in the House of Commons to set Britain on one course in which fairness is put at the heart of its political and economic system or another in which it remains trapped in the conservative institutions and values that produced the current pass. Parliament is so hung that there are potential majorities for both. Nick Clegg and his colleagues now face the most fateful decision of their lives. Much of what is wrong in Britain springs from the dysfunctionality of its state and the way that spills over into its financial system. Conservatives in both principal parties warmly approve of British democracy as delivering strong, decisive and stable government. It does no such thing. It delivers strong, one-party government, which is very different. It produces half-baked ideological policies, clumsy implementation and makes government susceptible to the lobbying of interest groups. Governments say yes because they don't have the broad political base to say no. The key to unlocking change is a fairer voting system. Fairness is also the value that keeps capitalism honest and more productive rather than collapsing into a world of rigged markets and Del Boy spivvery. The more profits and high salaries are fairly earned by diligence, effort, innovation and investment the stronger the economy that results. The heart of the financial crisis was that bankers dispensed with such concerns and built a financial system grounded in looting. The route out of Britain's budgetary and long-term growth crisis is to hardwire fairness into the state and our capitalism. The Liberal Democrats say they believe this. Now is the opportunity to make it happen. So far, the discussions about who is going to form a government around which policy programme have been conducted in an atmosphere of gentlemanly civility, as if the parties were cricket teams from our better private schools trying to reach agreement over the appropriate run rate if rain has interrupted play. Westminster school's Mr Clegg says he must talk first to the party with the highest share of the vote, to which Mr Brown can only accede as gracefully as possible; Etonian Mr Cameron says he thanks him for his offer and has responded with what he says is a big, open and comprehensive offer to the Liberal Democrats. Teams, comprising Oxford chums, are meeting from both sides as they might before a debate at the Union. But what is in play is infinitely more serious. The Liberal Democrats have the opportunity to create a proper coalition government that can last for at least two or three years and transform the country. There can be fair voting, fair deficit reduction and fair capitalism. Mr Cameron may offer this in his anxiety for power, to capitalise on his political momentum, overflowing coffers and so be in a position to call an early second election when he chooses. This is a mortal threat to the penniless Lib Dems and bankrupt Labour party which are in no position to fight; there would be a Tory government by default. But if Cameron fails to strike a deal, his party could easily collapse into bitter open feuding between its Eurosceptic Thatcherite and liberal wings. For the realisation is dawning across the political class that Clegg, for now, holds all the aces and that is because there is a viable alternative to coalition with the Conservatives. It is coalition with Labour. That delivers 315 House of Commons votes compared with the 315 that the Tories can deliver with the Democrat Unionists. The balance of the votes to reach the magic 321 – given that five Sinn Fein MPs don't vote – to win a parliamentary majority is much easier for this rainbow coalition than the Tories. The Green MP (congratulations, Brighton), the non-unionists from Northern Ireland and the Welsh Nationalists provide the key votes and would broadly agree with such a coalition's aims and values. Clegg, as one outgoing cabinet minister has said to me, could expect to be deputy prime minister in such a coalition and ask for half-a-dozen cabinet seats. He can play hard ball. This is real power and it comes but once a generation. It is power to insist on a referendum on proportional representation. Power to break up the banking system and reconstruct British finance. Power to insist on civil liberties and repeal of the legislation on ID cards. Power to require that British newspapers are owned by EU, if not British, nationals who pay UK tax and conform to British competition policy. Clegg has been so roughed up by News International and the Telegraph that at the very least Mr Murdoch and the Barclays brothers should pay tax for the privilege. The Liberal Democrats can be political eunuchs or they can use the moment to effect the change that brought them into politics. The Conservative argument is that losers have no democratic right to form a coalition government. Moreover, such is the extent of the budgetary crisis – and the worrying movements of the financial market – that Britain must have stable rather than coalition government to drive through the necessary change. This is wrong on every count. First, the British parliamentary system is built on representative democracy. After a general election, the government of the day seeks its mandate in the House of Commons. If it can deliver a majority of one, then it is the government. As a matter of psephological fact, the rainbow coalition would represent approaching 53% of the electorate and have a majority in the House of Commons. It may infuriate the Conservatives, but this is a both a constitutionally and politically legitimate government. The ""losers"" have a parliamentary majority because the general election did not produce a one-party winner. Then there is the budgetary crisis and the contagion effects of the crisis in the euro zone. The task is to get the maximum political support for tough measures over time, preferably announced within weeks, but which are introduced by a government keenly aware of the fragility of the recovery, the ongoing weakness of the financial system and the legacy of private debt hanging like a sword of Damocles over everything. One of the reasons the Conservatives did not win outright was that their economic stance was unconvincing and ideological. The Liberal Democrats have an obligation to insist on something different. There must be level-headedness. Reducing Britain's deficit only becomes an existential challenge if nearly all the reduction is shouldered by spending cuts over the lifetime of one parliament as the Tories insist. This is stupid. In the past – after the IMF and ERM crises – around half the adjustment has come from tax increases and we have taken six or seven years to get the job done. To go faster in current circumstances is to risk ongoing economic stagnation. Deficit cutting must be tough, but conditional on the pace of recovery. The new government must focus on phased cuts in current spending, especially on public sector pay, pensions and unintended welfare spending on the better off, but also substantial if phased tax increases. Additional tax on financial services, environmental pollution and higher VAT are right and inevitable. A later pension age – 67 by 2020 – and cancellation of prestige defence projects will also be necessary. If possible, some of the damaging cuts in capital spending should be rescinded. On top, finance needs to be faced down and on this the Tories, financed by the City and hostile to Europe, are not solid partners. The Europeans want stronger European financial regulation and tougher rules to hold the line on the euro; they must be supported, but Cameron's first instinct will be to oppose, risking a first order crisis in both the euro and the EU. The City can no longer be indulged. There has to be detailed agreement on all this and on reform of the voting system, the touchstone of it all. The evidence across Europe is that it requires full coalition governments that can agree on detailed programmes of action to deliver, but the precondition for success is sufficient congruence of values. Halfway houses – tacit support of minority governments – do not work. Clegg's judgment call will be whether he can get enough from Cameron to make the coalition a success and whether enough of Cameron's party are decent, liberal conservatives like their leader. It is hard not to be sceptical; the Conservative party above anything else is about power, in which case there is the battered bruiser in Number 10 as coalition partner – a convert, if belatedly, to what Clegg now wants. In May 1997, I thought mistakenly that an incoming Labour government would transform the British state and capitalism. In May 2010, there is another, and for my generation, one last chance: a reforming rainbow coalition government. The fate of progressive Britain – and the country – lies in Nick Clegg's hands. • More election comment from Cif at the polls","Forget the niceties, Nick, shun the Tories and join with Labour | Will Hutton",2010-05-08T19:00:01Z,Will Hutton,politics
"A Mrs Amel Marmouri, from Novara, has just become the first person in Italy to be fined for wearing a burqa in public. Her husband says he will not allow other men to look at her: ""If the law says she can't wear one,"" says Mr Marmouri, ""then she will have to stay in night and day."" Unfortunate Mrs Marmouri. How will she adjust to life as a non-person? Maybe she should get in touch with Harriet Harman. Or, since they are more of an age, Yvette Cooper, or any of the other, theoretically prominent Labour women who spent the election campaign either tagged or under house arrest. It appears they did not all go quietly. Yvette Cooper questioned her relegation to a humiliating ""second division"" event near the beginning of the election campaign and was not seen outside again. When, more recently, a mutinous Ms Harman challenged the terms of her captivity, it is reported that one of her protectors, Lord Mandelson, roughly told her to ""shut up"". Although there were worries, after she was gagged, placed in a sack and then dragged away by Douglas Alexander, that Ms Harman might never return, male honour now appears to have been satisfied. At 10 on election night, just as soon as the vote could not be affected, Labour's women were free to resume their traditional work for female emancipation. On Thursday night, there were even sightings of the mythical caravanner, Margaret Beckett. For the Tories, the liberation of Theresa May allowed Michael Gove, just for a few seconds, to stop talking. Although, at the time of writing, Harriet has yet to re-emerge, it can't be long before she's back, stressing the contrast between Labour's diversity and the Tories' arrant misogyny. ""Is this the situation in the modern Conservative party?"" she likes to quote herself saying, in her first appearance at PMQs. ""That women should be seen and not heard?"" Far better to do the thing properly, as in Labour's campaign, and ensure that women are not seen either. Unless, that is, they are content to define themselves as loyal wives, mothers, grannies, relicts or, in this progressive party, repentant prostitutes. Providing these biblical requirements have been met, and are not jeopardised by worldly ambition, Labour will not merely forgive a woman her weaknesses, but actively nurture her special preoccupations with the family, maternity leave and tax credits. Hence the party's devotion to Mumsnet, where the proposal of a pre-eminent reproductive identity, incorporating women of every ideological stripe, has attracted a succession of ministers who would never dream of courting, say, dads, or the one-fifth of women who are united in not having children. Hence, too, Gordon Brown's immediate approval of Mrs Duffy, before she was disgraced by her opinions. ""You're a good woman,"" he said, on hearing she had issue: just what one would expect from a man whose tribute to his wife, on the eve of the election, dwelt on her peerless servicing of his biological needs. ""I think she's doing a great job as a mother and she's doing a great job as a wife."" But there is much more, surely, to Sarah Brown than that. In years to come, let us hope she receives proper recognition as a wife who not only outperformed rival wives, with her incessant tweeting, blogging and snogging, but eclipsed every elected woman in Mr Brown's parliament. Not even Cherie Blair, in her pomp, was capable of this. Norma Major was, comparatively, a radical feminist of the Dworkin school. Mrs Brown's vision of womanhood takes us back much further, before Barbara Castle or Betty Boothroyd got any ideas of political grandeur, to the era of Brief Encounter. Except that, unlike the film's troubled, prewar housewife, Laura, stifled in her claustrophobic marriage, Mrs Brown seems perfectly content with her surrendered status. It is a clue to Laura's moral confusion, after she meets Alec at the railway station, that she is tempted, briefly, to pretend she understands his doctor's jargon. ""I see,"" she says, when he talks about preventative medicine. ""I'm afraid you don't,"" says Alec. Laura accepts his correction. ""I was trying to be intelligent."" That is not a mistake the educated Mrs Brown has made, even once, in her accounts of Downing Street date nights and bathtime frolics. Taking the same, vintage approach to gender roles, each of Labour's election broadcasts was narrated or presented by a man, in a sequence that went from grizzled, via Doctor Who, to outright thug: Sean Pertwee, David Tennant, Peter Davison, Eddie Izzard and Ross Kemp, snarling: ""Be careful"" at fearful dependents of the female persuasion. Even Labour's rival in female manipulation, the new John Lewis tear-jerker, invests more dignity in a life defined by family responsibilities. With their working wives, but no female colleagues, neither Cameron nor Clegg did better. Judging by the last few weeks, the political consensus on female respectability places elegant wives and mothers in the first rank, followed by nurses (also known as ""angels""), horny-handed ""mums"", caring grandmothers, cancer victims (treated to a special Labour scare story), single women with children, followed by childless single women who cannot be bribed with tax credits, women politicians and, lastly, the widow, mum of two and former prime minister, Baroness Thatcher. Thanks to Labour's vision of a women-free public life, reinforced by both rival parties, it should be generations before her freakish achievement is ever approached, let alone repeated. As much as they may welcome this move towards a western caliphate, Wahhabist clerics must be wondering if they've missed a trick. The politicians make it look so easy. But how was wife and mum Harriet Harman, quondam hammer of inequality, made to endorse the instruments of her own oppression? Could it be that Douglas Alexander knows something about patronising and marginalising women that orthodox religious leaders do not? Or did Ms Harman, deputy leader of her party, collude in this operation? All we know, for sure, is that the current generation of Labour mullahs studied at the feet of Blair and Campbell, whose sofa government proved as effective as any medieval method for subduing women and never left a mark. These electoral campaigns could not, however, have been so damaging to women's prospects in public life without the assistance of British broadcasters. Defying all recent complaints about the absence of mature women on screen, editors ensured that every significant election event was mediated by men, including individuals whose staggering mediocrity or ugliness confirmed that maleness was their only conceivable qualification. In a limited but welcome concession to its critics, the BBC introduced Martha Kearney's ""election lunch party"" on Radio 4's World at One. This bitter pill was, however, sugared by that now-customary signal that women and politics have, unaccountably, collided: Martha's home-made biscuits. • More election comment from Cif at the polls",One thing the parties agree on – keep women out | Catherine Bennett,2010-05-08T16:00:00Z,Catherine Bennett,politics
"Nick Clegg knew this moment was coming and he dreaded it. In the closing days of the campaign, he would muse privately on his reluctance to take part in an exhausted, post-election scramble to form a government. The politicians, he predicted, would be over-tired, overwrought and still antagonistic to one another, unable to think clearly. If they had to make a decision of such gravity, Clegg hoped they would be able to do so in a state of quiet calm, not in a panicked rush to cobble an administration together in time for the markets on Monday morning. In this, as in so much else, the Liberal Democrat leader was to be disappointed. Denied the surge in support and seats the polls had promised, he lacked the clout to tell David Cameron and Gordon Brown to calm down and get a good night's sleep. Instead he had to play fair maiden while the two suitors bowed before him, each offering a more perfect union than the other. The result is that a sleep-deprived Clegg grapples this weekend with an excruciating dilemma. Only elected to parliament in 2005, it now falls to him to choose the next prime minister. Nearly 30m votes were cast on Thursday but only one matters now: it is up to Clegg to give the nod to what he used to deride as ""the red or the blue team"". And whether he turns left or right, trouble awaits. The appeal of a Conservative relationship – whether the flirtation of enabling a Tory minority government or the formality of marriage – is clear. Clegg always said he would deal first with the party with the most votes and seats, his definition of ""a moral right to govern"". He can justifiably claim that a majority voted for change and therefore he is honour bound to install a new prime minister. But the drawbacks are glaring. Too many Lib Dems – including big names such as Lords Ashdown and Steel – hint that they could not swallow an alliance with the old Tory enemy, so far apart on Europe, immigration and Trident. Millions of Lib Dem voters will feel the same way, howling that they didn't vote Clegg only to get Cameron. Besides, and more crudely, Cameron hasn't offered Clegg enough – so far. All he pledged on the Lib Dem holy grail issue of electoral reform was an all-party inquiry. That's the most meagre form of promise in the political vocabulary. Perhaps it's an opening bid and will improve with negotiation. Or maybe the Tory leader's unreconstructed backbenchers will allow him to go no further, refusing to grant what the Lib Dems yearn for: proportional representation. Clegg can see the trap here. If he rejects Tory advances over PR, the Conservatives will slam the Lib Dems for putting their narrow, anorak obsession with the electoral system ahead of Cameron's much-vaunted ""national interest"". That's the Tories' game: to make Clegg an offer he'll look churlish to refuse. If he looks leftward, he'll find a Labour prime minister all but gagging to do a deal, promising the earth on electoral reform. Some Lib Dems in Tory seats will object, but most would feel more comfortable with Labour than they ever would with the Conservatives. And yet there are downsides. A Lib-Lab government would be branded a coalition of losers, one that vindicated the Tory slogan ""Vote Clegg, get Brown"". However desperate Brown is, he might struggle to give Clegg full-blown PR: too many Labour MPs will say no. Clegg worries too that, even if agreement were possible, the electorate would be unforgiving: they want to see their politicians focusing on jobs, not the electoral rules of the Westminster club. For every pro, there is a con. Clegg has somehow to find a compromise his party and the country can live with. In the process he has to solve a riddle his party have ducked for decades: do they belong on the left or right? He has to decide something else too: whether the Lib Dems are truly hungry for power – or whether the glue that has held them together all these years is the purity of powerlessness. That's a question for his party but also for him personally. Now that he has a chance to get it, what does Nick Clegg really want? • More Guardian election comment from Cif at the polls",Hung parliament: Nick Clegg forced to play fair maiden as suitors bow,2010-05-07T19:16:17Z,Jonathan Freedland,politics
"The British electorate has spoken but has choked on its words. Labour's glad confident morning of 1997 has clearly ended in defeat under Gordon Brown. David Cameron has rescued his Tory party from 18 years of decay but not convincingly, and not enough to give him a secure parliamentary majority. The third party that promised so much, the Liberal Democrats, has failed to make a breakthrough, and yet it must decide which party to support in office – and with a poor mandate for so important a decision. The first-past-the-post electoral system has met its Waterloo. Britain has not been given emphatic government just when that was most required. It has been given the parliamentary mess most feared by opponents of electoral reform – or the negotiating base most desired by its advocates. British politics now departs the hustings and enters the old smoke-filled rooms of Westminster. Since Cameron cannot yet be sure of the confidence of the House of Commons, the first move clearly lies with Brown as incumbent prime minister. He is down but not out. He has clearly been beaten by the Conservatives but is entitled to see if he can form an anti-Tory alliance with the Liberal Democrats and possibly the so-called Celtic fringe. It would have to defy the bald fact that the Tories are certain to be the largest party, and most disciplined in the whipping cauldron of a hung parliament. The Tories will also ask the Liberal Democrats and nationalists their intentions, and with the added moral authority of being the party that has clearly been preferred by the electorate. The nation will simply have to wait while the minority parties make up their minds. That is what ""voting for a hung parliament"" means. Nick Clegg and his Liberal Democrats now have their moment of power, but it will be just a moment. They have failed to win enough votes to carry an overwhelming moral case for electoral reform, yet they have not supplanted Labour on the centre-left. They may pray for the Tory lead to be big enough to leave the decision in the hands of the nationalists, but that seems unlikely. Whatever they decide they may well split over it, and may have to defend at an early re-election. Their recent ecstasy will swiftly turn to agony. • More Guardian election comment from Cif at the polls",This is what hung parliament means | SImon Jenkins,2010-05-07T05:43:38Z,Simon Jenkins,politics
"This most fateful week in politics will determine the shape of our state, the future character of British politics and how this country chooses to make the massive economic adjustments that lie ahead. The debates and campaign should have measured up to the nature of these choices. They did not. A hesitant, cynical and concerned electorate is hedging its political bets. On this weekend's opinion poll evidence, we will wake up to a hung parliament on Friday, with the Conservatives the single biggest party but short of even 300 MPS. On the other hand, a coalition of Liberal Democrat and Labour MPs, perhaps including the Welsh and Scottish Nationalists, will be able to command a majority if they can find a way to agree. Politicians can connive in the old system. Nick Clegg could permit a minority Tory government to form because it has won the most seats and the highest share of the popular vote. David Cameron may offer Clegg a few concessions to gain his consent, but he will go to the country again before the pain of his economic measures are felt and as soon as the Lib Dem surge fades. He will want to win a proper mandate for a fully fledged Conservative government and then refine the first-past-the-post voting system, reduce the number of constituencies by 10% but in so doing redraw their boundaries to be fairer to the Tories and disqualify Scottish and Welsh MPs from voting on English issues. The state will become a Conservative fiefdom, with even local police forces directly run by Tory politicians in the name of ""democratic accountability"". The City of London will not be reformed. Wealth will become ever more concentrated in fewer hands. Scotland, Wales and many English regions will be devastated by swingeing public spending cuts – almost their sole economic prop for the last decade – and by ongoing de-industrialisation. The management of an economy burdened by excessive private debt, fragile banks and a faltering economic recovery will be ideological. The prison population will grow even faster than under Labour as populist social repression intensifies. There will be some worthwhile improvements – the scrapping of ID cards and aspects of the Big Society programme which has been too quickly dismissed by liberal critics – but in the round Britain will become a meaner, less generous and more unequal society despite David Cameron's declared intentions. This will be Murdoch's Britain, with the BBC to be cut back and Sky's influence extended. Government will be in thrall to the right of centre press. The sale of our companies to the highest foreign bidder will accelerate. Or there is a second choice. Labour and the Lib Dems can form a time-limited coalition administration for two years with a negotiated programme of government. There will be three great aims. The first will be constitutional reform culminating in a referendum on introducing a proportional voting system and a promise to have a general election immediately afterwards. The second will be root-and-branch reform of British finance and putting in place a British innovation ecosystem to support wealth and job generation. And the third will be a deficit reduction programme that is managed not to damage recovery, an issue on which Gordon Brown is right. Beyond those initiatives, the coalition could introduce the pupil premium to improve the conditions of disadvantaged working-class children. It will build on the advances of the NHS. It will not politicise the police service. It will suspend the introduction of ID cards. It will start building a less carbon-dependent civilisation. Above all, it will usher in a world of pluralist politics, coalition government and deliver progressive ideas from a broader strand of opinion than just whatever coterie is around the leadership of the Labour party. A growing number of the outgoing cabinet would like this to happen. Lord Adonis, the transport secretary, has made the case in public. But none of them has yet made the paradigm shift from old politics. They think that Brown could remain prime minister, for example, arguing that he commands the majority of the MPs in the coalition; any other outcome would be ""unstable"". There might be an equal number of cabinet seats for the Lib Dems, but Number 10 would remain in Labour control. The proportional voting system put to the country at the referendum would be the pale version offered by Labour in its manifesto and nothing more radical. They are desperate to avoid Labour coming third in the popular vote. They claim a vote for a Lib Dem is to give the election to the Tories. They want to sustain the Tory-Labour duopoly. In the next five days, the Labour leadership has to transform its thinking. It has to prepare itself for the most astonishing 12 hours in its history. It must start by recognising that no era of new politics can be plausibly ushered in by Gordon Brown. He will have lost the general election – losing more than 100 seats while the Tories win 70 or 80 and the Lib Dems 20 or 30. The country will not accept that having kicked him out he is miraculously back. Only a monumentally unfair voting system will have given Labour three times the Lib Dems' parliamentary representation. Brown cannot be part of the future. Who will lead the coalition? Here, Labour must, in British terms, learn lessons in far-sightedness and generosity from people such as Mandela. On Thursday evening, a group of senior Labour politicians from all wings of the party has to tell Brown to go and offer to deliver Labour to a Lib Dem-Labour coalition led by Clegg. The deputy leader of the party, Harriet Harman, should immediately open negotiations with the Lib Dems over the programme for government while Labour hammers out who will lead it into the general election of spring 2012. Will Clegg accept? It is the best and possibly only opportunity his party will have to change the voting system. To refuse would be to shy away from an historical opportunity. Would the country accept? The two parties together will constitute more than 55% of the popular vote and a majority in the House of Commons. It was what the electorate voted for and there is deep wisdom in democracies. To have anyone else leading the coalition would be illegitimate. Will the markets worry about weak coalition government and sell the pound? Not if the new government is clear and fast in setting out which extra taxes it will raise and what spending it will cut, even if it decides to be measured about the timing of their introduction. The near-insuperable obstacle is the Labour party. It has been a beneficiary of the old political duopoly for a long time. A moment of this type may be beyond it. Some of the key figures will find it very hard to swallow such a bitter pill or even accept the case for more radical proportional representation. After all, Labour will have more MPs. Why is its leader not the prime minister? It will worry that Clegg will not make a reliable coalition partner etc, etc. Labour pays lip service to pluralist politics and the ""progressive consensus"", but when the chips are down it believes in its heart that it is the sole progressive party. These are understandable reactions. The Labour party, for all its recent history, is Britain's agent-in-chief of change. Our health service, our universities, our schools and the best parts of our welfare system bear its stamp. It carries a willingness to challenge private monopoly power, class privilege, unearned status. It exists to fight for ordinary and disadvantaged people. But the lesson of the last 13 years, and the prospect for the next 13, are inescapable. The party needs allies, fresh energy and to find its courage again. There are other values that count – liberty, individual conscience, respect for the community , wariness about too much state – that Labour does not hold dear in the same way as the Lib Dems. It is this coalition of values and interests that must underpin a great, reforming, transitional, coalition government – and what I believe the country now needs and demands. On Thursday, use your vote to get it. If the Labour party even now could change the state and our politics, it would be the greatest achievement in its history.","If Labour is wise, it will usher Nick Clegg into Downing Street | Will Hutton",2010-05-01T23:06:57Z,Will Hutton,politics
"Our poet laureate was among the first to record, though with great tact, that the ash cloud had a glorious silver lining. ""Britain's birds sing in this spring,"" wrote Carol Ann Duffy. Is she busy this weekend? Though the hateful plane traffic is back, there remains a pressing need for a poem, preferably on the epic scale, recognising nature's achievement of something else we had come to believe was impossible: the silencing of Michael O'Leary. Even now, in parks and gardens all over the country, the only sound is the cheering and hosannas of Ryanair survivors, including those previously too traumatised to speak. Have not the days following O'Leary's reluctant capitulation to European law recalled a more innocent time, when travellers still enjoyed the right to free tap water, or indeed to be pushed along in a wheelchair without paying for the inconvenience this causes to Ryanair operatives who are thereby forced to break off from fining and insulting able-bodied passengers? This, surely, is life as Shakespeare must have known it. On the other hand, as the airport expert and philosopher Alain de Botton argued, in a week that, you might think, comprehensively disproved the claim that it is better to travel than to arrive, suffering is largely the point. ""We come from a tradition of pilgrimage,"" he told Newsnight, ""and pilgrimage is a way of travelling where you try to make it difficult for yourself because you feel there's a benefit."" Happily, the Pope will be here soon, to commence Mr O'Leary's long journey towards canonisation. Meanwhile, from the same perspective, the lack of aeroplane seats is still doing numberless holidaymakers a tremendous spiritual favour. Yet another of Eyjafjallajökull's silver linings, at least from the government's point of view, was its arrival at a time when so many potential troublemakers were already held captive in this country, most commentariat leave having been cancelled for the election. Given the fuss of which alpha male talent is capable, when delayed in a congested Stansted airport, or denied its favourite pair of underpants, it is hard even to conceive of Gordon Brown's difficulties had prominent broadcasters been simultaneously stranded (as volcano-relief parlance has it), in Easter holiday hellholes such as Venice, Bali and Marrakech. There was relief, too, at the BBC, where Jana Bennett was discovered to be still in the country. Still abroad, however, were enough stranded travellers from all parts of the media to tweet, blog or file answers to the big question, posed by one: ""How fast can heaven become hell?"" In New York – useful packing tip, this, for anyone planning a trip – Chris Moyles soon ran out of deodorant. In Milan, Kevin Marsh, head of the BBC's journalism college, looked on the bright side: ""The one thing I have is resource."" In Oman, hotel guests were reduced to rinsing their own underwear, and even, driven by the human instinct for survival, to scavenge illicit rolls from the breakfast buffet. In the circumstances, it is a miracle that Stanley Johnson got home without being eaten. As we know, since the BBC celebrated his historic return with a re-enactment of Chay Blyth's entry into Portsmouth, Mr Johnson had been busily threatening wildlife in the Galápagos islands when the volcano, perhaps in revenge, threatened resumption of his duties as Boris's father. Returning home, via Madrid and, in the absence of flights, a ferry from Santander, he was one of several hundred Britons whose arrival at the port coincided with that of an amphibious landing ship, HMS Albion, there to pick up troops trying to come home from Afghanistan. Cognisant of the alternative – a full fare from Santander – Mr Johnson hailed his rescue as a ""mini-Dunkirk"". ""If the volcano had made life difficult for people like my wife and me,"" he wrote, ""spare a thought for our soldiers in Afghanistan."" His was not the first major challenge to public compassion. The failure of fellow Dunkirk expert Dan Snow's mercy mission after he announced it on Twitter had also indicated that expectations of public sympathy might, among some affluent holidaymakers, outstrip what was actually available. Snow Jr said he was ""really upset"" that his thwarted passengers would have to wait for ferries, due to an inexplicable enthusiasm on France's part for securing her national borders, even from his emergency inflatables. Were conditions in Calais such as to justify exceptional measures, including the deployment of navy vessels to evacuate multitudes of sturdy tourists, as well as a number of more vulnerable ones? At first, the absurd Brown encouraged the idea. The Mail pointed out that our warships were, after all, just sitting around in the sea, ""circling uselessly"". Maybe it would win the approval of that paper if, in the next election debate, Nick Clegg proposed that these relics from a different world order be decommissioned and placed on tourism stand-by, ready to fill with plucky Johnsons the next time holiday heaven turns into hell? There can have been few more compelling demonstrations, in recent years, of the importance of resilience, a terrifically fashionable concept that thinktanks now try to apply to everything from national readiness for emergencies to the ability of poor people to cope with financial difficulties. Insofar as a non-wonk can grasp it, resilience means the ability of a system or person to cope with setbacks. Some progressives think it should be taught in schools. Last week, in a paper about the BNP vote, the Institute for Public Policy Research concluded that the party is least popular in places that are resilient and most popular where people are not resilient. Richmond is resilient. Barnsley isn't. (Haiti even less so.) The hope is that resilience can be acquired, even though, obviously, not everyone can share Richmond's advantages of employment, education and health. ""People who are employed,"" the IPPR has noted, generally ""have access to more resources than those who are unemployed"". These resources, such as confidence and wealth, can be drawn on ""in a time of shock or crisis"". Among hardier ash-victims, for instance, finances combined with health, ingenuity, family and a sense of empowerment (another resilience indicator) to help when the authorities would not. Kevin Marsh plotted his escape from Milan in a taxi (""I settle on €750"") and groups of fleeing skiers organised joint escapes. ""We have just arrived home after a €2,000 taxi ride from Courchevel in the French Alps,"" was one of many tales of resilience posted on the BBC website. Resourceful, but less affluent young tourists could also deal with adversity, running to the front of queues and tweeting for help. Meanwhile, days after these survivors exhausted the public's interest in spreading ash, impoverished passengers were still camped out at distant airports where available tickets were going first to travellers with the resilience – or cash – to pay. One woman described a most un-Bottonian ""dog-eat-dog atmosphere"", among tourists competing for seats at Bangkok airport. Lessons will certainly have to be learned from this.

"Like the right to box and the right to join the Garrick club, the right to be Gordon Brown's cannon fodder is not one for which I have ever felt inclined to agitate. The death toll in Afghanistan and its unchanging accompaniment – Brown's routine about assaults upon civilians which would otherwise proceed directly from Helmand to Bloomsbury – only confirm that life is too precious to be placed at the disposal of Labour's armchair generals. The pressing question, surely, is not how do we get women into futile combat, but how do we keep men out of it? But long before Brown and Blair reminded us of how cheaply the life of an 18-year-old is valued when political reputations are at stake, generations of women cherished the idea, however deluded and essentialist, that their sex was too peace-loving to fight. A sex difference this flattering is obviously hard to relinquish, even where the logic of equal rights demands it. In 2000, UN Security Council Resolution 1325 formalised what the Greenham women had always said: that male militarism must yield, ultimately, to female peacemaking. The resolution stated that women and girls suffered disproportionately in war and urged member states to involve women ""in all peacekeeping and peace-building measures"". Its demand for equal rights in conflict resolution was not matched, however, by a request that similar opportunities be offered to women in the preceding armed hostilities. We might have relied upon that temple of undying conflict, Trevor Phillips's Equality and Human Rights Commission, to underline the dismally stereotyping nature of the UN approach. In a recent memorandum on the armed forces, EHRC officers recalled the anxiety of their predecessor regiment, the Equal Opportunities Commission, that ""'societal attitudes"" should not preclude consideration of ""women closing with and killing the enemy"". If the world has yet to produce a woman with sufficient bloodlust to command the EHRC, this body is keen to disseminate a more thoroughly martial approach, urging the armed forces to confront ""stereotypical views of the relative qualities of servicemen and servicewomen"". After some centuries of prejudice in this respect the army has not done badly, you might think, in catching up. A few years ago, a pregnant soldier would have had to quit. Today, as we are reminded by the case of Miss, formerly corporal, Tilern DeBique, the army is happy to have single parents in its ranks as long as reliable childcare arrangements are combined with a willingness to make the ultimate sacrifice. It was not Miss DeBique's status as a single parent that led to her successful case for compensation – indignant army message boards confirm that they are legion – but evidence that her superiors had not done enough to help her find childcare for Tahlia (now four), for reasons that were discriminatory. The army's excuse that it had exempted her from weekend duties and early starts and, following her complaint, offered Ms DeBique a five-year posting with childcare, featuring a guarantee that she would not have to go to war (hardly a conventional understanding of readiness for combat), did not convince the tribunal. It only emphasised the difficulties of sending a four-year-old's mother to war, even for the occasional afternoon, that Miss DeBique was obliged to take her daughter to the tribunal, where the child reportedly occupied herself with colouring books while her mother explained why she deserved around £1m in compensation for her losses, which included ""hurt feelings"". Confirming that the army's requirement for soldiers to be available for duty ""24/7, 365 days a year"" was indirect sex discrimination (since women were more likely than men to be single parents with primary childcare responsibility), and that she should have been helped to recruit her sister from the Caribbean for help with childcare, the tribunal finally awarded DeBique a modest £17,016, including £2,016 for hurt feelings, a cause for much silent sorrow, no doubt, among employment lawyers who had earlier been crowing over a rich new seam of multiple discrimination. Perhaps you have to be a lawyer to understand how an institutionally warlike organisation which requires from its employees a willingness to give their lives could ever conform with civilian expectations on fairness, let alone be expected to have their families' best interests at heart. What is the appropriate recruiting message: ""Happy kids make happy corpses!"" perhaps? If the army has been lamentably shortsighted in failing to anticipate the demands of single parents (particularly those recruited from abroad), then so, too, have equal rights campaigners who have agitated for an army that now requires a woman such as Ms DeBique to pledge her life in Britain's interests, when her death would leave a child effectively orphaned. The child of a military single mother must have some competing rights here that go beyond quality care while she is being sacrificed on behalf of President Karzai, who believes, inter alia, that women should have their husbands' permission to leave the house. In practice, sex discrimination is already central to army life: because of it, women soldiers, single parents or not, are less likely than male combatants to be killed, captured or maimed. To the frustration of anti-essentialist campaigners, the MoD is still exempted from parts of the Sex Discrimination Act, allowing the army to keep women away – with many heroic exceptions – from close combat. Infuriating as this must be for female recruits who crave exactly this experience, there are probably many others who are quite satisfied with the exemption and, indeed, who envy DeBique her rejected no-war guarantee. Among male soldiers as well as less fortunate female ones, one can conceive of a different response. When he was sentenced, in March, for going Awol rather than return to Afghanistan, Joe Glenton was rebuked, more than anything, for letting his fellow soldiers down. ""Your absence,"" said the judge advocate, ""meant that either your unit due to serve in Afghanistan was undermanned or someone else would have had to take your place."" Glenton is still serving a nine-month sentence. A less extreme, but like-minded stringency about letting fellow soldiers down, by not turning up on parade, appears to have contributed to the sequence of events that led to DeBique's tribunal, and subsequent pay-out. The small award in her case, by a tribunal aware that any compensation would be compared to the sums paid for the missing limbs of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, still fails to clarify the extent to which life in the armed forces should conform to civilian regulations. In particular, it muddies the question of single parents' duties in the army. Should they be full participants, 24/7, in what an officer described to DeBique as a ""war fighting machine""? Or are they special cases, whose commitments are justifiably deputed to more flexible, more killable soldiers?

"There is only one argument to have about the economy. It is about how this country is to grow. Get that right and the existential threat to jobs, living standards and public services will start to lift. Get it wrong and some of the extravagant warnings from some in the international investment community – Britain's economy rests on a bed of nitroglycerine and so on – will be amply justified. We will become a country whose productive capacity is inadequate against the scale of our debts and the expectations of our citizens. We will be Greece. After the cataclysmic mistakes made by our banks, there is so much relief that we still have both a banking system and a recovery that the national debate over the economy has relaxed. It is really worrying that despite the deep structural and institutional malfunctions that poleaxed the economy and which are scarcely being discussed, so many business leaders feel they should try to boost Conservative fortunes over something as essentially trivial as a half per cent rise in national insurance contributions. They plainly think that it is safe to go back to business as usual – politically as well as economically – siding with symbolic Conservative tax cuts against apparent Labour public sector inefficiency. Even if the economic arguments were that simple (they're not – national insurance contributions are a tax on wages, not jobs, and the impact will be negligible) the debate is a diversion. Our problems are in a different league. I respect the Today programme's Evan Davis and John Humphrys, but their disappointing interviews with David Cameron and Gordon Brown last week were characterised by the same assumption made by our highly politicised CEOs: the Big Crisis has lifted and it's now about managing the aftermath. Wrong. Britain's long-run growth rate over the last 20 years was little more than 2%, propelled by industries such as construction, estate agency, retailing, property and financial services which were dependent upon an accompanying vast growth of residential and commercial real estate debt. Our private property-related debt by proportion to national output is larger than any other large country, including Japan. Plainly, the same sectors cannot grow in the same way over the next 20 years. So Britain faces a triple challenge. Private property debt has to shrink. Different industries, less dependent upon property debt and imports, have to drive our growth in future. And these new industries need to raise the growth rate from the historic 2% to over 3% in order to deliver jobs to stave off an employment crisis and sustain a sufficient tax base to support our existing public services. We have, in short, lived through an epic economic mistake culminating in a first order financial crisis. There cannot be a return to business as usual. We need to understand what went wrong, put it right and build on the parts of the economy that have prospered despite the wider madness. This is the test that this week's party manifestos have to pass. We have had far too few original economic initiatives aimed at the right target. We need some fast or this election campaign will descend into farce. It's obvious what went wrong. Britain boasts the most profoundly dysfunctional financial system of any G7 country. It's not just that it went nearer to collapse than any other in the autumn of 2008, it does not know how to finance enterprise. It is constructed to provide mortgages and to trade in speculative financial instruments. Unless it is radically reconstructed and reformed, Britain can kiss goodbye to its economic future. Any lingering doubts as to the truth of this should be dispelled by the astonishing story of quantitative easing, all £200bn of it. If any other central bank printed £200bn and injected it into the banking system over 12 months, you might expect some part to find its way to business. Indeed, when the programme began, this is what the Bank of England hoped. What actually happened is that quantitative easing cash is going where cash has gone over the last 20 years – to support property and share prices – because that is what the UK financial system is set up to do. Quantitative easing has become the most flagrantly regressive public policy intervention in modern times. It has enriched the wealthy further by putting a floor under especially high-priced property, boosted share prices and done nothing for small- and medium-sized business. This can't go on. There were some good proposals, albeit embryonic, in Alistair Darling's last budget, but they were tiny besides the scale of what is needed. Britain needs to break up its megabanks addicted to mortgage lending and create a financial system populated by smaller banks, and in particular specialist business banks. We need infrastructure banks; housing banks; green banks; creative industries banks; knowledge economy banks – the list is long. We need radically fewer takeovers and mergers and to reorient shareholding around commitment to enterprise rather than creating the opportunity for hedge fund partners to make fortunes; Labour's leaked manifesto promise to raise the bar on foreign takeovers is an useful step forward. And we need to mobilise resources behind small- and medium-sized firms – tomorrow's economy.This needs to be matched by a great build-up in public investment – not crucifying it as the government plans and which the Conservatives intend to intensify. The focus on deficit reduction must be on reducing current spending and raising current revenues. Three measures are obvious. VAT needs to be lifted to 21%, many current exemptions lifted and the disadvantaged compensated with benefit increases. The baby boomers, who, as Tory frontbencher David Willetts pointed out in his new book, The Pinch, have lived gilded lives compared with their children, need to be asked for a special sacrifice. The pension age needs to be raised to 67 or even 68 by 2020. Lastly, environmental ""bads"" – carbon, airline fuel etc – need to be taxed. Together, these measures would progressively close the deficit by more than £100bn, with growth doing most of the rest. The electorate is not dumb. We know the wealth of the last two decades was fairy dust. We know bankers don't know how to help enterprise. We know the country has to make its living differently in future. We know that requires a mix of belt-tightening and huge investment. We do not see why the public services we rely on should be emasculated while the business and banking leaders who caused the crisis lead lives of unearned opulence. We would like to hear our political leaders talk in these terms. We want the next government to begin the work. So far it's been a phoney electoral war. Let's hope it gets better fast.","The country's renewal is being betrayed by cheap, paltry politics | Will Hutton",2010-04-10T23:07:54Z,Will Hutton,politics
"The aliens have spoken. New Labour's proposed ""tax on jobs"" – next April's increase in national insurance contributions – must be rescinded, they say. Instead, the money must be found from further ""efficiency savings"", despite both parties' existing commitment to find at least £11bn of such savings. To discover another £6bn to compensate for the lost tax revenue stretches credulity, but that's not a worry for our aliens, Britain's crusading chief executive officers. As Richard Lambert, the director-general of the CBI, said last week, today's CEOs are people who, for the first time in history, have become seriously rich as mere officers of their companies rather than risking any money of their own. In his speech at the Royal Society of Arts, he pointed out that these CEOs are now so extravagantly remunerated that they occupy a different galaxy from the rest of us – and risk becoming aliens in their own communities. Nobody can be certain for whom and what they speak. Sir Stuart Rose, a leading signatory of the joint letter to the Daily Telegraph, is the best-paid executive chair of a public company ever to stalk these islands. Mick Davis, CEO of Xstrata, now based in Zug, Switzerland, collected £5m last year. Even one of the few genuine entrepreneurs among them, Stelios Haji-Iaonnou, the founder of easyJet, offers his CEOs an eye-popping 200% annual bonus on their base pay and a long-term incentive plan on top. These gentlemen weigh in from Planet Extravagance when a tax is proposed, but are mute in the debate that Lambert opened about the purpose of business after the epic strategic mistakes that capitalism has recently made. There has been a culture change, argues Lambert, begun in the financial sector, in which takeovers, deals, financial engineering and wild short-termism has become the order of the day. Chief executives were paid 47 times average pay in 2000; today, they are paid 81 times the average. And all directly or indirectly colluded in the change that triggered the greatest economic calamity since the 1930s. None blew a whistle, raised a doubt or suggested strategic options. All trousered the bonuses. Nor was there any noteworthy collective improvement, despite all the dealing, in the performance of the firms they ran over and above what one might expect from reasonable stewardship. Are they intervening now, within weeks of a general election, because of their genuine concern to promote employment or because absorbing an increased payroll tax will hit their profits and personal bonuses and a Conservative government will be more congenial for their personal interests? Society should be suspicious of their motives. Capitalism, and the worthwhile purpose of profit, becomes devalued and delegitimised. Richard Lambert quoted one of his heroes, American Dave Packard, co-founder of Hewlett-Packard, who declared that only an adequate profit was necessary to fund research and product innovation along with serving customers, communities and providing employment. Packard came from the generation of entrepreneurs who lived through depression, war and the great clash with socialism and knew that while capitalism was better, it had to be fought for. Its personal rewards had to remain proportional and profits had to deliver wider goals than just shareholder value. Today, no such concern worries Britain's class of bounty hunter CEOs. Lambert could have come closer to home, to two great British contemporaries of Packard: Ove Arup (OK, he was half-Danish), founder of one of the Arup Partnership, and John Spedan Lewis, founder of John Lewis. In his parting speech, Ove Arup declared that excessive personal pay divided rather than united companies and the divided organisation collapsed. Best keep the pay of the top people satisfactory and in touch with what other workers earned. Arup, like Lewis, was a visionary. Both believed in the notion that firms were essentially moral enterprises and that the point of profit was to serve the business purpose of the firm. Both created firms as employee-owned, value-driven partnerships. Neither Lewis nor Arup was especially religious, but they were closely aware of religious teaching. Arup's appeal to unity and morality in business closely follows Catholic social doctrine. As for Lewis, he declared in quasi-biblical terms that ""it is all wrong to have millionaires before you have ceased to have slums"". ""The present state of affairs is really a perversion of the proper working of capitalism,"" he thundered in 1957. ""Capitalism has done enormous good and suits human nature far too well to be given up as long as human nature remains the same. But the perversion has given us too unstable a society. Differences of reward must be large enough to induce people to do their best but the present differences are far too great."" You can only guess at what he would have made of today's excesses. Lambert is right – modern capitalism has arrived at a moral dead end, interested largely in feathering the nests of its leaders while imposing enormous costs on the rest of society and accepting no reciprocal obligations. Neither Lewis nor Arup would have dreamt of needing to be paid 81 times the salary of an average worker to do their job or of investing a nanosecond in trying to evade or avoid tax. They aimed to build enduring innovative organisations and to do so was a matter of enormous satisfaction in itself. And don't think of them as quasi-socialists – there are no unions in either firm because none is needed. To change matters requires both moral conviction and a political readiness to engineer a series of deep reforms in the way company ownership is discharged, corporate governance is conceived, executives are remunerated and workers represented. Today's secularisation of society and decline of religion have meant that the kind of value system that succoured Packard, Arup and Lewis in their moral beliefs is disappearing. I doubt if any CEOs signing letters much worry about morals or religion and even practising Christian business leaders, such as HSBC's chair Stephen Green, while wringing their hands and searching their souls, do not offer a bold lead. For all its merits, hardly a passage in Green's recent book, Good Value, compares to the standard set by Lewis or Arup, even if his heart is plainly in the right place. But you also need morally convinced politicians prepared to take the risk of reform. We have none. The Tories are fired up by the thought of curbing the state and building a Big Society, but not by correcting capitalist excess. New Labour, 13 years in office, has not dared, apart from the odd speech by Paul Myners and Peter Mandelson at the last, to propose any significant reform. On this question, this Easter, it presents a moral vacuum. The banks have got away virtually scot free after the greatest bailout in history. We need a reformed capitalism driven by innovation and a sense of responsibility, yet there is no such prospectus on offer. That's amazing after what we have lived through.

"Same old problem. Just when you need a Labour party there is none in sight – and clearly not one in the coming election. On Monday evening the parties' three economic spokesmen went head to head and stroked each other to a draw. They nattered away like cleaning ladies over how to clear up after the great bankers' ball. There were smashed derivatives, defaulted swaps and toxic turds strewn everywhere – and who, they said, was going to pick up the £170bn bill? None of them discussed whether the party should have been allowed in the first place. I suddenly craved some good old Labour blood and guts, an Arthur Scargill, a Tony Benn, a Michael Foot, a Nye Bevan, someone to shout in their faces: ""You blew it! When those petrified, knock-kneed smoothies from the City came pleading for help, you caved in and gave them the people's money. You panicked, you bunch of creeps."" That is what a real Labour party would have said: ""When, back in October 2008, the bankers told you they were too big to fail, you believed them. You were conned. Your economics was too rusty to call their bluff. Now you have wrecked everything we stand for, everything you and your government have done in a decade. You, Darling, are a banker's stooge, another Ramsay MacDonald."" A Labour spokesman on Monday night would have pointed out that taxes would now rise, hospitals would close, workers be sacked, students lose grants, child poverty increase, all because Darling lacked the guts to stand up to the City. He had done more damage to the British economy in one year than Scargill's miners or Jack Dash's dockers ever did. Look at the mess we are in. Labour would not have moped over whose ""efficiency savings"" were the more meaningless but pointed out that the three spokesmen were peas from the same pod. The Tories' George Osborne never questioned the bank bail-out because his friends were bankers. Indeed, he thought the Treasury should have panicked sooner. Vince Cable, whose path to political sanctity is endlessly to curse sin and bless virtue, was equally bamboozled by the City ramp. He bought ""too big to fail"" in his book, The Storm, and his only response was a Liberal Democrat miasma of on-the-one-hand-on-the-other. Of course we shall never know what the world would be like today had Darling reacted differently in 2008. It could hardly have been worse. I gather some smart business schools are starting to play the relevant ""war games"". Some scenarios, such as just letting the banks fail, are undeniably hairy, though the global market in finance is astonishingly resilient and would, by now, probably be picking up the pieces and getting back to normal. America still eats and breathes, despite the failure of Lehman Brothers. More plausible, a Labour party would argue that Darling should have properly nationalised the ailing banks, in a version of what he did to Northern Rock the year before. He could then have secured ordinary deposits, up to any limit, ringfenced business lending (as the Treasury did when it nationalised banks during the war), and put the casino divisions into bankruptcy administration, dumping their worst debts on the vulture fund market. He could then have rebuilt good and bad banks, and eventually resold them. The impact would have been traumatic, and much of the money now being extorted from present and future taxpayers would have been lost to them in some other way. Insurance and pension funds would have taken a pounding as defaults cascaded through the financial system. But much of the burden would have fallen on those who had benefited from the bubble in the first place, and the racketeers would have been hung out to dry. The ""quantitative easing"" money that simply disappeared, much of it overseas – and which has fuelled the past year's stockmarket boom – should have been used to boost demand in the high street by raising pensions and social security payments and instituting mass scrappage schemes. Public policy would have been directed at restructuring the supply of credit rather than, as now, doing absolutely nothing to stop it all happening again – bonuses, derivatives and all. Such an intervention would have been both properly Keynesian and properly monetarist. There would have been no need for the savage deflation permitted by Darling from late 2008 which emptied shops, collapsed lending and threw thousands out of work. It is reportedly now threatening, according to a Treasury estimate, one third of all spending on the health service by the end of the decade. This deflation is harsher than anything abroad. It is harsher than Margaret Thatcher's medicine of 1980-1. Darling's policy was not a bailout on a par with British Leyland or Upper Clyde. It was a gigantic, unprecedented, overnight evaporation of the nation's cash. We are told on the grapevine that in October 2008, as Downing Street stared ""into the abyss"" (as bankers love to put it), the chief horror was not the prospect of dismantling 10 years of government and mortgaging the future. The horror was of Darling and Gordon Brown being accused of ""old-style nationalisation"" by precisely the banks who were now pleading for the new-style version: public subsidy with no strings attached. Darling pretends that the only alternative to his capitulation was ""cash machines seizing up and bank doors closing"". That is bankers' blackmail. A gambler's family does not have to starve if you ringfence his income and give it to the grocer while denying him access to the casino. Darling merely let the gamblers return to their ways. He won all the disadvantages of bank nationalisation with none of the advantages. He spent the money but failed to use the power. This is the treason against the left of which a Labour party would have accused him on Monday night. Without a Labour party, this argument is dead. The Tories are intellectual lightweights. Nobody dares mention the awful truth that, whatever rescue might have been appropriate when the bubble burst, it cannot conceivably justify the devastation about to be inflicted on Britain's infrastructure and social services. Money on the scale disbursed by Darling a year ago should have gone, if at all, to the public benefit, not to correcting imbalances in bank indebtedness. That is what a real Labour party would have said on Monday night. For once, it would have been right.",I long for a real Labour voice to slam this City-fearing trio | Simon Jenkins,2010-03-30T19:30:00Z,Simon Jenkins,politics
"What had been a bad day for Pope Benedict XVI last Wednesday evening was about to get worse. Still reeling from accusations that he personally had connived in the Catholic church's cover-up of clerical sex abuse, it's believed that he may have sought solace in the reassuring authority of the BBC World Service. Soon he'd wish he hadn't. ""And we have unconfirmed reports from our Paisley correspondent of a shock that will rock the church to its foundations: St Mirren 4, Celtic 0."" Ever since Pope John XXIII's famous 1961 encyclical Celticum Novarum, every pontiff is required to say a couple of decades of the rosary and a wee benediction to the famous club in Glasgow's East End. Aren't they? Very soon, Tony Mowbray's week was about to get worse. This hapless, permanently despairing manager of Celtic was duly sacked the following day. You simply cannot be a Celtic manager and get thumped by St Mirren like that. The latest reversal was Celtic's 13th defeat of the season, their worst return for almost 20 years. On a trip to Celtic Park on match days, you will encounter tumbleweed blowing along the rows of seats in this cavernous stadium where once there were people. And it is at this point that I must declare an interest: I am a Celtic supporter, a hoops man, a member of the green and white brigade, an inhabitant, on match days, of Paradise. A follower of the grand old team. As such, my response to the catastrophe in Paisley was not a reasonable one. Indeed, it was entirely disproportionate to what had just happened. Many other people, mostly men, similarly took a holiday from reason. And so did the Scottish newspapers. In the few days prior to the sacking of Tony Mowbray, several important events had occurred in the world: President Barack Obama had instigated the most radical reform of healthcare in the US for 50 years; Alistair Darling had just delivered what will probably be the last-ever budget of the New Labour era; Pope Benedict is indeed facing up to the Catholic church's worst crisis since the Reformation. The story of the week, though, was Celtic's capitulation in Paisley and the removal of their manager. These irrational attacks started when I was seven years old and Celtic had just lost the European Cup final to Feyenoord. I am 46 years old now and I still haven't managed to attain a sense of perspective. After a couple of days, a patina of reason does begin to settle and you ask yourself why you behave like this and you try to deconstruct your response. Family, relationships and children are all important. Check. Being just and kind and generous also. Check. My carbon footprint is coming down every week. Check. Soon it will be an ethically unambiguous size two. And yet. And yet… Celtic are still just as important as all of them. Many of us have moved beyond asking ourselves if it's worth it. We don't have a choice in the matter any longer, for the club has been woven into the fabric of our being. It is in our DNA and will be handed down through the generations. Part of it is the romantic narrative of Celtic – Brother Walfrid and his quest to start a football club in Glasgow's East End to provide succour and sustenance for the destitute, reviled and displaced Irish. Yet that is only part of it. In the decades that followed, each Celtic victory made the toil and the poverty and the fear of the previous week all worthwhile. The club gave sustenance to an entire, displaced people as they waited to be given permission to be equal in Scottish society. Swearing allegiance to the club complemented our faith and our family commitments. Celtic, in our minds, represented socialism, church and self-respect. And it has grown beyond its Irish Catholic hinterland and embraces all faiths and none. We are the Hebrew slaves looking for freedom from captivity. Only the league title and victory in Europe can bring deliverance. Everywhere we look there are enemies: most of the referees, the Scottish Football Association, the press (AKA the bourgeois establishment running dogs), Rangers FC, Margaret Thatcher. Yes, even now. Paranoia is our bride and it must be fed and watered and nurtured afresh each day. This season Celtic have suffered half-a-dozen dodgy decisions by referees in games against Rangers. This conspiracy, we convince ourselves, is why Rangers will win the league. The inconvenient reality, though, is that Celtic, despite having the best-paid players in Scotland, could not beat Falkirk, Kilmarnock, St Mirren and Motherwell. Oil tankers can change direction more quickly than the Celtic strikers. The defenders, meanwhile, ought to be fitted with SatNav devices. We are fond of saying that Celtic is more than just a club and we convince ourselves that it means more to us than other clubs do to their fans. But it isn't true. The supporters of Rangers, Manchester United, East Fife and Doncaster Rovers have the same passion. Indeed, most football fans, unlike those of Celtic, have little in the way of silver to sustain them through the decades. What is true, though, is that while our loyalty to our churches and our communities have declined, our oaths of fealty to our football clubs are steadfast. We know that we are fleeced by the club's executives on a regular basis. We pay silly prices for gadgets we don't need because they bear our club's colours. Recently, I purchased for my household a Celtic toaster. You stick the bread in and out pops a slice of toast with ""CELTIC"" stencilled on to it. I really ought to report myself to someone and should not venture out alone in shopping hours. There is a reason for this, though. In less than a generation, Labour has ditched Clause 4 and given succour to bankers. Last week, a Labour prime minister who stole our pensions condemned a union for striking on behalf of workers who voted overwhelmingly for it on two occasions. Such, too, has been the betrayal of my church that the hierarchy has lost its moral authority to rule. The structures upon which many of our lives were built have become diseased.

"It always amazes me, the appetite lawyers have for arguing about things that they could just look up. They're like drunks. Sorry, of course it's not that simple – if you were just going to look it up, shrug and leave it at that, the law wouldn't have progressed at all since Magna Carta, and I'd still be able to shoot dead a Welshman, so long as I was standing on the soil of Monmouth. Precedents have to be set, which is what makes the Radmacher v Granatino case about prenuptial agreements so fascinating – well, that, her fabulous teeth and his claim that having to live on £30k a year would leave him destitute. She is a German heiress who allegedly did not give him a full picture of her likely inheritance when they signed a prenup. He is a French heir himself, though not to the same level of £100m outlandishness. Besides deceit, Granatino is arguing a degree of sexism – he gave up his job as an investment banker to take a doctorate in biotechnology, and claims that a woman who gave up her job ""for a more child-centred and low-paid career"" would be better treated. I think he's right, and there are double standards here – Radmacher's lawyers point out that: a) he could always go back to being a merchant banker; and b) you never know, he might hit the big time as a biochemist. Both these things are true, but when the roles are reversed – some big shot guy has married a supermodel, say – nobody ever says: ""It was her choice to give up work, she could still get catalogue shoots."" Bah, what do I know, I'm no lawyer. It is always pointed out that English law doesn't uphold prenups, unlike American and much of western European law – the inference being that we're a bit odd, and probably out of date. In fact, it's not strictly true: what is true is that spouses – however daft they are, however little legal advice they seek upon signing a prenup – can't sign away their rights to maintenance, and they especially can't sign away their children's rights to maintenance. A landmark ruling in 2008 (MacLeod v MacLeod) found a postnuptial agreement slightly more convincing than a prenup, but still adjusted the final award in favour of the poorer party (in this case the wife), and made plain: ""The board takes the view that it is not open to them to reverse the long-standing rule that ante-nuptial agreements are contrary to public policy and thus not valid or binding in the contractual sense."" Having said all that, maintenance and alimony are only one element of divorce: it's been common since 1980 for couples to enter into Edgar agreements, which are used to protect lump sums and similar, and these are very often upheld. Judges tend to need a pretty good reason to overturn them. Yeah, it's easy to forget about lump sums, isn't it? I can normally get through an entire conversation about divorce, even with a person in the middle of divorcing, without the term ""lump sum"" being mentioned. Of course I don't want to speculate about other people's finances (how vulgar), but taking a wild stab in the dark I would say that even the most careful saver, able to hoard over years something that could legitimately be called a ""lump sum"", would see it immediately swallowed by the swamp of war, the house moves, the maintenance, the pina coladas, the palliative PlayStations and sweets, the chaos of turning one family into two households. Whatever precedent Radmacher v Granatino sets, it won't shake the foundations of divorce settlements – the principles whereby separated parents have financial obligations to one another and their children. It will most likely relate to lump sum agreements and, in short, be a rich person's precedent – just like MacLeod was a rich person's precedent, and Crossley v Crossley before that. Perhaps all cases that reach precedent status will most likely be between rich people, since they are the ones with the money to chase them all the way to the court of appeal. But I truly doubt prenup precedent setting will ever filter down to anybody who would class themselves as ""non-super-rich"", let alone ""regular people"". I'm not saying the world doesn't need these rules. It's just a bit like setting a precedent on how much space you have to leave when you park your yacht. It strikes me, though, that the above-named super-rich spend unconscionable (even for them) amounts of money trying to enter into the contract of marriage just to then wriggle out of it again. What they need is not better prenuptial law, but a different kind of marriage. Exactly that, in fact: a kind-of-marriage, with all the frills of a proper marriage and none of the financial provision in law. They could brand it attractively, call it Billionaires' Wedding (though its full name in a register office would be ""tightwads' partnership""). Since its only takers would be incredibly rich people, I wouldn't be surprised to find that, a couple of years down the line, it would have its own cachet, would be the Hermès scarf of unions, for no reason at all but the musk of money brought with it. It would save them this endless wrangling, and the rest of the world a lot of human endeavour.",Perplexed by prenups?

"I'll try to keep this as un-gory as possible for animal-loving readers. Perhaps you are reading this while patting your dog, stroking your cat, or changing the straw for your child's hamster. I really wouldn't want to spoil such beautiful quintessentially British moments. We all know that Britain prides itself on being a ""nation of animal lovers"". However, facts are facts, and tomorrow in Doha, Qatar, at the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), a proposal from Kenya for a 20-year ban on ivory sales is likely to fail because key members of the EU are refusing to support it. One of them is Britain. Britain is going with the Cites stance that ""one-off sales of stockpiled ivory"" help fund conservation, and reduce poaching by satisfying demand. Which completely ignores the new report from a 27-strong team of conservationists and scientists saying that one-off sales have not delivered on conservation, have increased the demand for ivory in far eastern countries such as Japan and China, and therefore encourage poaching. Tearing oneself away from the blizzard of ""unsubstantiated allegations, blah blah"" of rampant horse-fixing and vote-gathering at Cites, one also reads that our own Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) is pondering whether to support a move for even less protection for Tanzanian and Zambian elephants. This decision will take them, ooh, at least six years. All this is going on in your name. Still feeling those ""nation of animal-lovers"" warm fuzzies? Strange how quickly this ""animal-lovers"" malarkey flies out of the window when big money or politics comes into it. A case of, everyone loves elephants, but when it gets a bit sticky with international sanctions and world trade, or means getting on the wrong side of highly lucrative expanding far eastern markets, it's: ""So long, Dumbo!"" In fairness, at Cites, Britain did back other conservation proposals (ie a failed one for bluefin tuna), but did they seriously believe that this stance on ivory sales would have our full public support? Probably not, but maybe they are banking on the bizarre loophole in British attitudes to animals. Our quasi-schizophrenic habit of cherry-picking when to care, and when not to give much of a stuff. After all, we are the nation who sobbed our hearts out at Rolf Harris's sick puppies on Animal Hospital, even as, year on year, RSPCA figures for animal cruelty were rising. Who occasionally get angry about factory farming, but much angrier when chickens don't cost one old farthing in the supermarket. And now whose government refuses to oppose ivory sales, even though it is bizarre that ivory could still be judged a ""material"" – would you put an ornament made of dogs' teeth on your mantelpiece? The government letting this opportunity pass by is a scandal, but surely the blame spreads far wider to public apathy. Maybe it is time to take a stand. Are we going to carry on being less a nation of animal lovers than a giant cultural ""petting zoo""? As in, sure, we love animals, but everything's got to be all fluffy and easy and nice, and occasionally we'll get out the Animal Hospital DVDs and weep with Rolf over sick gerbils. Or are we going to be the kind who react with outrage and action when our views are not represented in arenas such as Cites, who are prepared to make trouble, sign petitions, pester EU reps? Who refuse to support legislation which experts believe encourages the poaching of fast-dwindling numbers of elephants – where, incidentally, the common practice is to exploit the elephants' strong family bonds, shooting the babies first, in order to lure in the adults. Maybe it is time for British people to start living up to our billing – if we really are this ""nation of animal lovers"", why aren't they hearing us roar? Rachel, try being softer and a little more Lady-like  One must give Rachel Johnson the benefit of the doubt and presume there was an element of mischievous editing in Channel 4's The Lady and the Revamp, which followed her taking over the editorship of ailing magazine The Lady. Certainly Johnson had her work cut out at The Lady, and she wasn't going to get anywhere, pottering about, being a ""nice gel"". Her basic ideas (sort out staff, modernise the title) were sound troubleshooting. However, there was something a bit callous and flippant about the way Johnson dealt with staff cuts, quipping about ""death lists"" and ""prising fingers off"". These were people's jobs – in many cases, their last ones, the majority of her employees seeming to come under the heading, ""Distressed gentlefolk of Chelsea"". While no one wanted Johnson to be constantly turbo-emoting (""Because she's a woman""), her glib manner was unsettling. And telling. Johnson came across as someone who'd never lost a job, and even if she had, was in the privileged position of viewing employment as primarily providing ""challenges"", rather than essential money to live. I think if you sack people, you should afford them the dignity of taking it seriously, just as they have to. Who will play Sahil in Bollywood? Very much enjoying the outcome of the Sahil Saeed kidnapping. It could have gone horribly wrong; miraculously it didn't, and it's a great story: Dad racing to the rescue, relatives pitching in with money, secret surveillance operations, cash handovers, arrests, and then five-year-old Sahil back home in Oldham, in his mother's arms, his uncle handing around celebratory bowls of sweets to well-wishers. Aw. One can almost hear the rattle of keyboards as the heart-warming Hollywood film writes itself. It might even feature some actual Indian people, which is more than could be said for Bollywood, currently under fire from activist political group MNS, for using too many white westerners. Ranging from celebrities such as Kylie Minogue, Sylvester Stallone, and, erm, Chris Patten's daughter, Alice, to ""attractive backpackers"" who are prepared to prance around in skimpy costumes, unlike many Indian girls. Meanwhile, local acting talent is missing out. The complaint is that eastern films don't look so eastern anymore. Indeed, while it is rumoured that MNS are cynically lunging for the female vote, there is a valid point. Shouldn't westerners know their place with Indian cinema? That place being sat on the cinema seats, not starring in the films. With India awash with homegrown talent, is there a genuine need for ""Bolly-Kylie""? It also bodes ill for the Bollywood take on the Sahil story. What should be a wonderful opportunity for Indian actors could end up as an over-westernised nightmare, or should that be ""white-mare""?

"It must be two years now since shopping authorities announced the death of the It bag. In the chastened era of austerity chic, or new frugality, or shopping your closet (they never did alight on a really nice term for economic hardship), the showy designer handbag would finally be seen for what it is: a leather extension of a luxury brand which has been marked up by around 10 or 12 times its actual cost. There would be what one accessories brain called a ""baglash"". Of course it would have its limits. No one expected much restraint from Russian trophy wives or from Victoria Beckham (who is to £4,200 Birkin bags what lonely oddballs are to birds' eggs). For the Blairs, too, love of ostentation goes too deep. But elsewhere it was time to be brave, and bring out last year's Isn't bag. Manfully, fashion writers cut back on their Sex and the City-ish references to ""arm candy"" and – in swanker, more FT-minded circles – to ""uber-special statement pieces"". Instead, they found a heroic new word for people who spent less on bags: recessionista. Out of sympathy for recessionistas, some rich people asked for their expensive stuff to be concealed inside cheap carriers. Others, fearful of looking gauche, pledged to stick rigorously to investment classics. Or vintage. ""Anything that trumpets extreme wealth,"" advised one fashion writer, ""looks frankly ugly and insensitive in the current climate."" Even for those who could afford them, Veblen goods were so over. In fashion terms, this was tantamount to philanthropy. Even if you didn't save the money you might have spent on a bag but squandered it, instead, at Primark and Uniqlo, this showed you were a good person who cared about all the Woolworths employees who were now forced to excavate their closets and recycle statement pieces. Along the way, recessionistas found, downturns could provide a kind of sartorial release. ""It's rather nice not to be dictated to by fashion and retail any more,"" the retail authority Mary Portas told one reporter. ""I picked up a Louis Vuitton scarf yesterday as I left the house, remembered it was from last year's collection, and thought how blissful it was that it just didn't matter any more."" It didn't? But a sorority of new thrift experts confirmed that such uber-embarrassing finds need not be thrown away. Buy a sewing machine, they suggested. Pretend it's wartime. Make do and mend. Sack your cleaner and snip your old Vuitton scarves into useful dusters. Create delicious stews from your old Jimmy Choos. Exfoliate your knees with unwanted Swarovski crystals. Keep an allotment and use your old Chloe Paddington to force rhubarb. Early last year, the head of Chanel, Karl Lagerfeld, confirmed the healthful benefits of fiscal chaos. ""This whole crisis is like a big spring house-cleaning – both moral and physical,"" he said. ""There is no creative evolution if you don't have dramatic moments like this. Bling is over. Red carpetry covered with rhinestones is out. I call it 'the new modesty'."" I wonder what Mr Lagerfeld calls it now. His fellow designers may still be in an earnest mood, but if It-bags are the pit-canaries of the luxury goods industry, there are abundant signs that conspicuous consumption has been forgiven. Hermès is now breeding crocodiles to keep up with demand for reptilian Birkins. Carla Bruni, quondam ""new modesty icon"" (the flat shoes clinched it), has been reinstated as a patron saint of bling: she is acclaimed the ""muse"" for a Roger Vivier bag, from a range that is so expensive its new London shop was ram-raided the day it opened. Noting Selfridges' announcement that sales of luxury bags have increased 60% in the last year, and Mulberry's upgraded profit forecast (largely thanks to demand for a £699 bag named after the TV presenter Alexa Chung) the Daily Mail concludes, along with most women's magazines, that the ""It bag is back"". Meaning fashion writers can resume, without embarrassment, their attempts to counter Keynes's paradox of thrift – whereby a sensible response to a recession, that of saving on arm candy, only brings more financial catastrophe. The more people buy, say, Kate Moss's ghastly new zebra stripe tote for Longchamp, the less we have to worry about someone like Tony Blair, who is employed by the luxury goods manufacturer LVMH, it's understood as a roving global handbag demonstrator. Terrific news, too, for fellow pillar of the handbag market, Samantha Cameron, the creative director of Smythson and, we now gather, ""social action"" champion for the Tory party. A free Nancy bag (£995) for every couple could be just the incentive to make marriage popular again. Of course it would be hasty to conclude from the sale of a few thousand bags that consumers have convinced themselves, in the absence of government advice to the contrary, that their experiment with austerity is complete. That non-affluent customers should be eager to buy expensive tat in a recession, many of them on credit, may simply reflect the efforts of a luxury industry that makes brilliant use of celebrities, such as Moss, Chung, Blair and – further up the bag-chain – Tracey Emin and Sofia Coppola. It can only have helped the luxury effort, however, that articles on the blessings of thrift have proved so much less enduring than the shameless greed inducements that constitute the FT's How to Spend It. ""Anybody with children should rush to Liberty,"" counsels the current online edition, ""all the Bonpoint chic, but at more user-friendly prices (from £20 for a Liberty print bib)"". Perhaps realising that all the fun has gone out of vintage-style frugality, Cameron has not mentioned thrift for almost a year. You don't hear much about umarked bags or stealth wealth any more. Nor has anything been glimpsed of the Daily Telegraph's Coping Classes since a tragic bulletin in February 2009 described them as ""battle-weary, broke and deeply disillusioned"". Perhaps they are in Selfridges right now, coping with the queue for Alexas. Unless they are eating cats. Merciful as the onset of austerity-fatigue must be for fashion magazines and luxury houses, it looks a little hasty. Improved economic projections only emerged last week, ages after Mulberry announced a 100% increase demand for its bag. What is it, other than the allure of telly's Alexa Chung, that gives consumers of modest net worth the confidence to ignore the possibility of rising prices, increased interest rates, endlessly stalled salaries or a sudden forward lurch in unemployment? Maybe this reported extravagance is a statement of boundless trust in the British economy; a tribute to Brown's dependability. His assurances and the thrift-aversion of the Tories could certainly be construed as encouraging anyone tempted by an £800 It-bag to splash right out. Just so long as they can borrow the money. Go on, forget the future: give yourself an economic stimulus. If the government won't shop from its closet, why on earth should anyone else?",Go on. Buy yourself an It bag.

"It's very easy to gossip about Sam Mendes and Kate Winslet – there is no shortage of photographs of either of them, standing (or better, sitting; better still, lying) next to an incredibly good-looking person. It's not like trying to find photos of a politician with an attractive cohort. We're not being scurrilous; we're just trying to repair our faith. Why do people split up? If there isn't a reason, we are forced to consider the possibility that just being together in the first place is enough to tear you apart, or it is if you're doing it right, and for long enough. Scratching around, then, we have to first rule out financial stresses (they're worth £30m between them), along with that showbiz catch-all that they didn't make time for one another in their jetset lifestyles. (Winslet had only recently returned from a year off work.) Neither of them was having an affair, or maybe they both were – it's all irrelevant because we're asking the wrong question. It's obvious why people would split up: habituation is its own excuse. But what makes people stay together? Celebrities don't immediately seem to offer any useful lessons, being so profoundly unusual, but they offer a neat insight into what people do when they aren't stressed. When money is no issue, when work can be picked up and put down, when intellectual and/or creative fulfilment is a given, when peer disapproval doesn't really exist because, well, you are peerless (and disapproval will rain down on you anyway, just for the shape of your teeth), how long do those relationships last? Not very long; really, six or so years is about the most of it, unless you're Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon – and even that, at 11 years, felt a lot longer than it actually was, though of course I can't speak for the people in it. We should look at stars not as aberrant wantons with too many attractive associates, but rather as humanity in laboratory conditions, all confounding factors removed. What, in their chamber of purity, do famous couples do? Why, they split up, of course. Meanwhile, outside the laboratory, politicians everywhere wheel out their wives as badges of righteousness. The idea of the everlasting couple is at the centre of every conversation about society. Certainly where children are involved, the one point on which every party would agree is how to shore up the parental partnership. Tories insist that it can be done with marriage. Their favourite statistic is that one in three unmarried couples who are parents will split up before their child's third birthday. I always think that sounds about right. Most relationships in one's twenties – relationships that aren't the Big Relationship – last about three years. The only difference between these ""problem"" broken families and the supposedly upstanding middle classes, who deferred the gratification of children for university, is we spent our twenties getting drunk. It's hardly a moral position. No account is taken, in this almost logical deduction, of the fact that married people are a self-selecting sample of people who are very serious about staying together. So there's no point harrying or bribing people into it, it's like giving up smoking: it only works if you wanted to do it in the first place. Others, meanwhile, point to poverty as a strain on relationships. An interesting element of the Millennium Cohort Study emerged this week – that parents of twins were more likely to divorce, generally citing financial hardship. There's rather a knotty formula here – a modest amount of financial strain probably keeps people together, too much drives them apart. I bet a statistician could identify the very 50p that tips a couple from not being able to afford to split up to not having enough money to stay together. And then there are the less tangible factors that Tories especially, along with not very shocking jocks, talk about – the fact that we don't stay together because society is ""broken"", because we lack backbone or are lazy, because the me-me-me baby-boomers and liberal barbarians tore down values that were valuable, for no better reasons than playful seventies nihilism and some free love. That all seems so last century and academic now; we might as well argue about whose fault it was that people lost grazing rights for their sheep on the south side of Southwark bridge. Accepted morality is very shaky, here – like taking drugs, if you divorce or separate in a genteel context, pay for it yourself and never end up in prison, then there's no problem, this needn't impede or tarnish you. I think as a divorcee with kids, you're expected to be rueful, but Winslet would never brook anybody telling her she'd contributed to a broken society, and nor should she. The relationship breakdown itself is never at issue, it's only where it intersects with income that the judgment is made – with money, you're an unlucky person making a difficult decision. Without, you're a delinquent. Public censure is confused, in other words, and the confusion makes it impotent. And censure was all governments ever had. In its absence, as thinktanks and policymakers scramble to agree what constitutes a ""gold standard"" for the family, between marriage and cohabitation, people make their own decisions – which for quite a few will mean deciding to split up. Why does anybody persist in thinking this is a disaster?","Kate Winslet's breakup isn't part of broken society, is it? | Zoe Williams",2010-03-17T22:30:01Z,Zoe Williams,society
"Things might get tense in the green room next week at the Walter E Washington Convention Centre in Washington, DC. Among the guest speakers at the annual conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or Aipac, will be both Hillary Clinton and Binyamin Netanyahu. Normally the US secretary of state and Israel's prime minister could be expected to engage in a mutual love-in. But these are not normal times. On Friday night Clinton surprised Netanyahu at home with a phone call that amounted to a 43-minute bollocking. Two days later President Obama's senior adviser, David Axelrod, accused Israel of an ""affront"" and an ""insult"" to the United States. No wonder Israel's ambassador to the US – who himself had been summoned to the state department for a dressing down – reported that relations between the two countries had slumped to a 35-year low. What's going on here between two nations normally seen as inseparable, allies so close their enemies depict them as a two-headed beast? The immediate cause of the fallout is the slap in the face Israel gave last week to the US vice-president, Joe Biden. A lifelong friend who is proud to call himself a Zionist, Biden was in the country on a mission to make nice, giving Israel a warm embrace on the eve of a new round of indirect Israeli-Palestinian talks. Biden's welcome gift from the Israelis was an announcement of the planned construction of 1,600 housing units in the Ramat Shlomo neighbourhood of East Jerusalem – even though the US had sought a freeze on all such building in areas conquered by Israel in 1967. That this was a poke in America's eye, few disputed. Netanyahu insisted that stupidity, not malice, was to blame: a low-level planning committee had made the decision on technical grounds, no offence intended. Biden responded by turning up 90 minutes late for dinner with Netanyahu and his wife, and delivering a ferocious statement of condemnation – but that seemed to be that. Until Hillary picked up the phone. Why would the Obama team have chosen to escalate a row they could easily have let fade away? ""They weren't exactly looking for a fight,"" says Daniel Levy, Middle East analyst of Washington's New America Foundation, whose ear is close to the administration ground. He notes that Obama is on the brink of passing healthcare reform – and hardly needs to distract attention from that most perilous of battles. The danger will be more acute if pro-Israel Democrats make a ""linkage"" between the two issues, demanding that Obama lower the pressure on Israel in return for their votes on the health bill. One explanation is the face-value one: that Obama was ""incandescent with rage"" at the one-fingered salute that greeted his deputy, and even more furious at Netanyahu's subsequent attempts at an apology. These insisted that Israel had every right to settle in East Jerusalem – but conceded that it was wrong to announce the fact while Biden was in town. This emphasis on timing was, says Levy, tantamount to saying: ""I'm sorry I slapped you on Monday: next time, I promise, it won't be on a Monday."" There are other explanations for the US decision to hit back hard. One is that Obama is seizing on the Biden row to send a message to the Arab world: to show that he won't be pushed around by Israel. This view has been given extra traction by a Foreign Policy article reporting that a team of senior officers from US Central Command recently briefed the top brass at the Pentagon, declaring that Israeli intransigence was damaging US standing in the region, and that Arab leaders now deemed the US too weak to stand up to its Israeli ally. Just yesterday, in testimony before the Senate armed services committee, General David Petraeus, the commander of Centcom, echoed that message, arguing that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict posed a threat to America's interests, that it ""foments anti-American sentiment, due to a perception of US favoritism for Israel"", and that ""anger over the Palestinian question"" aided al-Qaida and other jihadist groups in their efforts to recruit support. Such views have long been conventional wisdom among liberal critics of Israel, but to hear such talk out loud from America's most senior soldier in the field is breathtaking. Perhaps Obama has taken the Centcom warnings to heart and is trying to make amends. He may have a darker purpose, hoping to notch up the first regime change of his presidency – by toppling Netanyahu. That is not wholly fanciful. The last time the US put such a serious squeeze on Israel was nearly 20 years ago, when the first George Bush threatened to withhold $10bn in loan guarantees to Israel if settlement building did not stop. That led eventually to the removal of the stubborn Yitzhak Shamir as prime minister and his replacement by the peace-seeking Yitzhak Rabin. Obama may be calculating that the same dynamic still holds today – that Israeli public opinion values good relations with the US above all else, and will cast aside any leader who gets on the wrong side of Washington. If that is the plan, then the three demands laid down by Hillary to Bibi – the cancellation of the Ramat Shlomo construction; a confidence-building gesture towards the Palestinians; and talks on core, rather than technical, issues – are well aimed. Just the first of those could bring down Bibi's coalition. Were he to surrender the principle that Israel is allowed to build where it likes in Jerusalem, his rightwing allies would bolt. Inside the Likud, Netanyahu – who has always insisted that Jerusalem must for ever remain undivided and under Israeli control – would be discredited. But the third demand is most intriguing. Instead of using the Biden flap simply to assert his own macho credentials – ""Don't cross me"" – Obama might be grasping hold of it as a rare chance to revive the near-dead peace process. His critics say that Israel never responds to pressure, that it only makes compromises when it feels secure. Only with the full backing of George W Bush did Ariel Sharon feel able to disengage from Gaza. But the Bush Sr experience tells a different story: that it was US pressure which dragged Israel to the peace table in Madrid in 1991, spawning the Oslo accords two years later. With that precedent in mind, Obama could dispense with the endless talks about talks that were about to get under way, shifting the ground away from process and procedure – the terrain on which Bibi is most comfortable – and to substance instead. He should do it, demanding both sides – Israeli and Palestinian – present their vision of the endgame, their statement of how they finally see this conflict being resolved. It would have to cover everything, even the most difficult areas: borders, refugees, Jerusalem. Netanyahu always says he is serious about peace. This exercise would force him, and his Palestinian counterparts, to say how serious. Then Obama should set out a vision of his own, including ""bridging proposals"" to close the gap between the two sides. If he is going to spend political capital on a peace process, let it at least be spent on peace – not process. Last week Israel slapped the US vice-president in the face. Now there is a chance to make that the slap heard around the world – the one that jolts America awake. • Comments on this article will remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight",Israel slapped America – and may have jolted Obama awake | Jonathan Freedland,2010-03-16T23:00:00Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"Ahh, Mother's Day. Our special time. Our day of maternal glory. Or a cellophane-wrapped ghetto of our own making? Every year it is the same for the more fortunate mothers all over the country – lie in bed having breakfast, get festooned with blooms as big as one's head. If very lucky, allow oneself to be transported out to lunch, with the all-too-fleeting thought: ""I am loved. I am appreciated. Life really can be like an episode of The Waltons."" Quite right, too. Who deserves spoiling more than the nation's mothers? Every year on Valentine's Day, when the world is drowning in flowers, chocolates and plastic cupids, there is a left-field spark of rebellion declaring how tacky, how wrong, it is to express one's romantic love on only one day of the year. To debase emotion, turning it into just another product placement opportunity for rampant commercialism. If you love someone, runs the rationale, you should be expressing it all the time, not just once a year, and not because a poster and a couple of shiny heart balloons in a Clinton Cards window reminded you to. Some people say this because they are lazy cheapskates who want an excuse not to make an effort (You know who you are). However, others say it because they care so passionately about romantic love, its purity and beauty, that they are moved to become ""anti-Valentine's Day"". Is there a similarly passionate anti-Mother's Day movement, saying, hang on, mothers are being short-changed – they should be loved and appreciated all through the year, not just on one poxy designated day? Well, no, there isn't. Which seems to say everything about how British society views mothers. While in countries such as Italy, mothers genuinely seem venerated to a certain degree, the average British mum spends her life bombarded from all sides by criticism, condemnation, and belittlement. Working mothers are blamed, for … you name it (""Everything In The World!""); stay-at-home mothers are sneered at (nothing to say for themselves!); younger mums are fretted over (too young!); older first-time mums are disparaged and mocked (too old!). Then of course there are single mums – so regularly dragged to the stake for a public witch burning people can barely be bothered to look up anymore. Are mothers really this imperfect? But wait – it's all OK, because, once a year, there's this special lovey-dovey day when everyone is really nice to them. As in: ""Oh yeah, sorry for all that pinning the blame on you for the nation's ills stuff. Here's a bunch of drooping chrysanthemums to make up for it"". This is the reality for British mums on Mother's Day. What some term a day celebrating motherhood, could more cynically be viewed as ""a 24-hour time period during which there is a higher-than-average chance that the nation's mothers will not get ferociously attacked on some level"". A break in the hostilities, akin to the first world war Christmas day football match, only this time its mothers scrambling out of the trenches, delighted by the ceasefire, though sadly aware that all too soon it will be starting up again. So will I be waking up today, refusing to participate in this bogus festival, ready to take a stand? No chance. Principles are all very well, but a lie-in is a lie-in, and as all modern mothers know, lie-ins are a feminist issue. Like many other mums, I will be eating my egg on toast, fuming if there is no bouquet as big as my head, looking forward to my lunch, hogging the remote control, and the rest. Mother's Day should be the day we receive a bit of spoiling from our nearest and dearest. It's the appreciation and respect from wider society that needs to continue throughout the year. Why memories are made of hiss A University of London study of 10,000 people, tracked since their birth in 1958, has proved that women have better memories than men. That seems an awful lot of time and trouble put into something that could have been achieved simply by asking a few long-term couples if you can sit in and observe when they have a row. It is then that the female memory is to be seen in all its majestic, ever so slightly disturbing, glory. The man may argue well, make good points, but it makes no difference. He's still toast. Women will simply unleash their ""Shock and Awe"" mental Rolodex of ""Everything That's Ever Happened in the Entire History of the Relationship"", cross-referencing with astonishing speed and skill, throwing in ancient, seemingly unconnected, micro-incidents, dragging the argument back to the present day in the closing seconds. It is an unequal contest, sometimes dreadful to behold. Men have no chance. The poor innocents having no idea that being slightly distracted by the football results in the pub four years ago could come back and haunt them in such a powerful way. Women know better. The man will be defeated, not because he is necessarily in the wrong, but because women are able to produce endless examples from the past to prove their all-consuming ""rightness"". There is something faintly tragic about this. Clearly women, the eternal relationship caretakers, are the only ones paying enough attention to store all these grudges and whinges away for ""future use"" – and what does that say about us? In short, we don't need science to tell us that we have better memories. Women already know that memory is one of our deadliest weapons, and, in some ways, a cross to bear. Your Majesty, you really have to put Philip in the Tower What's with the continuing sanitisation of Prince Philip? When did people decide that he was a harmless old duffer and overlook his sexist and racist remarks? Something has to explain why ""Ol' Slitty Eyes"" keeps getting away with it. Only last week he was visiting sea cadets in Exeter, and a young woman there told him she worked in a club. ""A strip club?"" responded Prince Philip, adding that it might be a ""bit cold"" for that kind of thing. So here we are at the end of International Women's Week, and our Queen's consort effectively says, ""You're female with a pulse, therefore you must take your clothes off for a living."" How far we've come! Admittedly, it isn't as bad as in 2002 when he asked an Australian Aborigine: ""Still throwing spears?"" However, it seems almost as if Philip has been sanitised by dint of his age. Now, instead of a public reaction such as: ""Someone drown him in a moat!"" it's: ""He's such a character!"" Come to think of it, didn't the royals used to lock their madder relatives away in attics? I'm sure we could all turn a blind eye if they wanted to revive the tradition.","It may be bogus, but hey...

"If anybody in Labour's upper reaches says they don't care about the revelations serialised in the Observer, they're fibbing. Page after page of detail on the dark moods that descended on ­Gordon Brown – the rages, the rudeness and even brutality towards aides, the shoving aside of trusted advisers, the punches aimed at the upholstery – is hardly ­helpful in the runup to an election in which the party leaders' character will be a dominant theme. It is damaging and few honest Labour folk will say otherwise. What's more, Andrew Rawnsley's book returns the focus to Brown at the very moment when David Cameron is beginning to face harsher scrutiny. Labour would have loved yesterday's news bulletins to have led with the fact that the gap between the two largest parties had shrunk to just six points – its narrowest in more than a year – according to a YouGov poll for the Sunday Times. Instead, the story of the day was a prime minister who had to be warned by the cabinet secretary to stop abusing the Downing Street staff – a claim later backed up by the head of the National Bullying Helpline, in an intervention which, even if it represents a stunning breach of confidentiality, threatens to be deeply wounding for Brown. And yet, for all that, there will have been some relief in Labour's ruling ­circle, which had been bracing itself for the Rawnsley book. For one thing, there was no revelation that brought a wholly new scandal to light – some action or pattern of behaviour that no one had heard of before. As one BBC correspondent put it yesterday: ""Gordon Brown's occasionally volcanic temper is hardly a state secret."" That fact should further limit the damage done, in that dark moods, even glowering rage, are already part of the picture voters have of the prime minister. Satirists have made gags for years about Brown's temper, delighting for example in the now-hoary tale of his ­stapling his own hand in fury. As the markets would put it, Brown's ­temperament is already ""in the price"", and can therefore be discounted. So the Brown circle will take some comfort from the fact that these ­latest revelations were not worse. They will also find consolation in the ­current political context. These stories would have had maximum impact at a time when Brown was vulnerable to a ­leadership challenge. His internal ­enemies would have used them as further evidence that he was not fit to lead the party into an election. Had the Rawnsley book come out, say, in that first weekend of June last year – ­following disastrous election results and James Purnell's cabinet ­resignation – it might have proved fatal. Instead it has surfaced just as Brown is at his safest, in the short period until polling day when the prospects of a coup against him are zero. The result is that even those who might privately lament the Brown style were defending him; Jacqui Smith and Peter Mandelson insisting that if Brown is impatient and moody, it's only because he cares about the country. So of course Andrew Rawnsley has delivered a bumper parcel of new ­material for Cameron to use at prime minister's questions on Wednesday – which he will without mercy – and for his rivals to hurl at him during the leaders' debates that will play such a key part in the coming election campaign. But Rawnsley has added to a headache that was already there. He has not created a new one.","Revelations about Brown are damaging, but they hold no surprises for voters",2010-02-22T07:00:02Z,Jonathan Freedland,politics
"Nothing is more certain to arouse the armchair moralist than too much debt. Every principle of fair and moral dealing seems to be offended. It is mortgaging the future. If fair rewards are the proportional and due result of one's efforts, debt is a means of unfairly living high on the hog today only to pay a bigger bill tomorrow. Borrowing to buy an asset such as a home or to fix an unanticipated piece of bad luck such as dry rot is more than justifiable. What is amoral is to try to escape the limits of what one fairly earns, worse still to pass the bill on to your children. If private debt arouses these sentiments, fast-growing public debt is even more provocative. We are now having our future mortgaged for us. It is public imprudence, a nation living beyond its means. If, on top, the annual deficit is the largest in Britain's peacetime history – as it will be this year – and it has been delivered by a discredited Labour government under a prime minister widely held to dissimulate to the point of outright dishonesty, then moral concern swells to outrage. Politicians are at their most effective if they are crusading with the moral force behind them. Debt is an issue on which David Cameron and the Conservatives feel they can take the high ground. We cannot go on like this, they insist. The deficit must be cut as a matter of moral urgency, more deeply and faster than the government plans. However, debt morality should never be confused with good economics. Good economics attempts to deliver a functioning economic system that works for all its members. Necessarily, credit and debt play crucial economic functions, allowing the system to manage the inevitable mismatches between flows of revenue and costs over time. Changes in public debt are a vital instrument to manage the economy efficiently and, crucially, morally and fairly. Bystanders may think that the battle between 60 economists who signed letters to the Financial Times repudiating the 20 who earlier signed a letter to the Sunday Times urging that Britain's public deficit to be eliminated in the lifetime of a parliament is a battle over economics. It is not. Economics is on the side of the 60. The gulf is about the morality of debt. The Sunday Times 20 are less economists and more, like the Tories, debt moralists. Underneath their unsubstantiated claim that currency and interest rate crises are inevitably associated with high public debt, so that recovery will be menaced, lay the scarcely concealed language of morality. By saying that the deficit was the largest in peacetime history, without placing it in the context of the largest-ever recession, the inference was clear. A government that needed to regain trust was immorally taking debt to exceptional levels without good reason. Budgetary propriety had to be restored fast. Debt moralism seems like common sense, but only if you put economics to one side. Three key linked economic arguments offer a different context to view the necessary growth of public debt and thus morality. The first is best set out in a recent paper from McKinsey Global Institute, Debt and Deleveraging: the global credit bubble and its economic consequences. The authors have analysed 45 countries suffering credit crises since 1930. Every shock has been followed by a period of six to seven years in which consumers and companies reduce their debt, on average by a quarter. Five countries – the US, the UK, Spain, South Korea and Canada – are now certain to go through the same painful process, if history is any guide. Because Britain has the most private debt proportional to its output, it is the most acutely at risk. The process has hardly begun, but it will mean a prolonged period of very low growth in private demand, which is economically devastating. Second, how best to respond? Here the evidence is provided by a paper by Emanuele Baldacci and Sanjeev Gupta, deputy division chief and deputy director of the IMF's fiscal affairs division, the high priests of fiscal conservatism. They have examined 118 financial crises in 99 countries between 1980 and 2008. On average, national output fell by 5%. Of course, loosening monetary policy is vital to limit the impact of recession. But so, they discover, is fiscal policy, the economists' term for spending, borrowing and taxing. Increasing borrowing by 1% of national output reliably reduces the length of recessions by 2½ months. The best response is increasing capital spending; lift that by 1% of national output and not only are recessions shorter, but there is a permanent boost to economic growth of around a third of 1%. The third argument, completing the chain, is that, despite fears, Britain is financially capable of using fiscal policy as it has. Here is my last exhibit – the Green Budget for 2010 by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. In partnership with economists from Barclays Bank, led by Simon Hayes, the IFS paints a bleak picture of a miserable 2% growth over the next decade. They observe that consumers are already doing what the McKinsey Global Institute predicts – saving and paying off debts. It is plain that if public spending fell any faster than the government plans, ie if there is an attempt to more than halve the deficit over four years, then growth would be even lower. But as the forecasters say, fortunately our plans to service the debt is within the margins of safety, never rising above 10% of tax revenues even at the peak moment for public debt in 2014/15. It started from a low base and interest rates are very low. They also remark that whatever the credit-rating agencies may say, Britain has not defaulted on its debt since the 14th century. There is zero risk today. These are the unambiguous economic arguments that persuaded the 60 economiststo take on the Sunday Times 20. Nobody disputes that there has to be a credible plan to lower the deficit, but policy driven by debt moralism is not credible. Credibility lies in deploying good economics to deliver ongoing growth within which the structural deficit can be attacked. The task is twofold: to find a way of attacking the structural deficit while sustaining and lifting growth. We need to try to protect public investment rather than halve it as existing plans do. And we need to create a national innovation ecosystem to support growth. The next decade is going to be very tough with huge economic risks. Debt moralists dominating the national debate do not help. It is difficult enough delivering good economic policy. Let's not make it even more difficult by making blinkered morality, rather than economics, the compass for what the next government does. That way lies perdition.","If we live by conservative morals, we will never escape this crisis | Will Hutton",2010-02-21T00:05:06Z,Will Hutton,politics
"Why is there no British Tea Party? Where are the crowds of revenue slaves flocking to London to demand redress for the squandering of their money? Marginal tax is rising to 50%, VAT to 17.5% and state spending towards half the national product. The Treasury has lost control of public finance. So why no furious blue-rinses, bail-out ­haters, bonus-bleaters and embittered VAT victims storming parliament? Has a corrupt political class reduced the ­British people to quiescent gerbils? The American Tea Party that met last weekend in Nashville under the aura of Sarah Palin is another of the meteoric movements, poujadist, projectionist, little man against big government, that spatter the democratic story. It is for personal liberty, lower taxes and fewer federal subsidies. The original Boston Tea Party may have been an act in ­defiance of free trade, but who cares? The new movement has an approval ­rating of 41%, against 35 for the ­Democrats and 28 for the Republicans. Such surges never last. It is a safe bet that every Tea Party-backed Republican who gets to Washington will promptly vote for pork barrel projects, defence uplifts, federal subsidies and tax breaks. As Catch-22 said, all subsidies are communist except those to alfalfa farmers, which are bulwarks of freedom. A shrewd party knows how to capitalise on such paradoxes. But the Tory leader, David Cameron, has a problem. He talks the talk. His speeches drip with shifting control from the state to society, with cutting quangos and devolving ""power to the front line"". The cliches are hoary, concocted from old PPE essays, aerated with accountability, responsibility and localism and with a Tory topping of family values. Blessed are those who believe in smaller government, for they shall inherit the ballot box. But no one is sure that Cameron believes a word of it, because no one is sure the people do. He commands a poll lead of which only carelessness can strip him, yet he seems unsure whether the floating electorate is inclined to Tea Party sentiments or not. They might not like government, but they like welfare. Cameron is full of uncertainty, clinging only to the nearest abstract noun. Lady Thatcher had the same insecurity in 1979. Desperate not to lose a single vote, she disregarded her core voters and excised from her manifesto all talk of privatisation, union reform or spending cuts. She pledged to pay the exorbitant ""Clegg awards"" to public workers, squandered money on defence, protected health and promised tax cuts. She had to endure two years of recession and budgetary chaos as a result. Cameron confronts an easier plight. Thatcher took over a public sector that consumed barely 40% of the nation's wealth, but that included the coal, steel, rail, gas, electricity and telecommunications industries. Since the 1980s, they have passed to the private sector. Three years after Labour came to power, the proportion was down to 36%. Now the activities that Thatcherism left in the public sector have soared to more than 53% of GDP. Services have improved, but not commensurate to the cost. There must be huge scope for reductions. Cameron appears to have done no work on the mechanics of cuts. He feels obliged to protect such wasteful programmes as defence procurement, overseas aid and the war in Afghanistan. He wants to reduce quangos yet will not say which ones. He is pledged to protect the gargantuan appetite of the NHS and education, despite evidence that this appetite has fattened overheads rather than the front line. Unwillingness to confront Osborne's traditional Treasury supremacism is leaving Cameron as vulnerable as was Tony Blair to squandermania, to centralist ­initiatives that always end in higher spending. His early years will be at the mercy of a target-driven cabinet machine, laden with pledges. Higher spending is always met from ""efficiency savings elsewhere"", savings that never materialise. The Tory leadership team seems naive, embarrassingly short of governing experience. Cameron mimics Blair in summoning celebrities to the flag, such as Richard Dannatt and Carol Vorderman. He fumbles his headline-grabbers, as on family taxes, health and grammar schools. The lack of a real job on his CV is all too noticeable. He is like Lord Cardigan, parading his ""cherry-bums"" before the gates of Deene, all cavalry bravura but miles from the reality of battle. The Tory party's most distinctive message had once been Cameron's desire to shift power from big government to localities. It gave welcome ideological substance to his rhetoric. The British people are not, like the American right, wholly averse to government and welfare. But in poll after poll, they dislike ""big central government"". They prefer what is local, communal, neighbourly. As they have shown in Scotland and Wales, they want local control over the raising and spending of taxes. Cameron's rejection of this programme under Osborne's influence has deprived him of his one distinctive and positive thrust. It was Tory and Tea Party at the same time. Though Cameron still talks local he refuses to free council taxes to take some of the pressure of central cuts, and even talks of freezing them. His decentralisation proposals are cosmetic and democratically empty. He has backed off elected mayors. Existing Tory council leaders offer him an invaluable pool of experience in budget-­slashing. Yet Cameron wants to keep them shackled by the Treasury. There is now a real tussle in the Tory camp. Those round Cameron's aide, Steve Hilton, urge caution. To be a modern centrist party is to be risk-averse. They advise their boss to murmur sweet nothings about ""change"", as did Blair. Cameron is a likeable, plausible candidate, so why risk the image with specifics? Why say anything? Just smile. But those in the Osborne camp goad Cameron back to the old ways. Raise totems to the household gods of Toryism. Yes, each totem may be a demon to the other side, but these are testing times and the race will go to the boldest. Both strategies have their strengths, and their weaknesses. I would opt for Hilton plus localism. But the most successful leader is an opportunist, snatching at whatever can be turned to advantage. Above all, he must not lose control and leave his followers ­uncertain of their destination. He must have a clear message. It is that message that ­Cameron lacks at present, with a coherence that only the leader can supply.",It may take a Tory Tea Party to make Cameron coherent | Simon Jenkins,2010-02-09T21:00:00Z,Simon Jenkins,politics
"It is a vile and insidious social disease that, for a few years now, has silently stalked the middle classes. It is so toxic that within seconds of the symptoms becoming evident the victim is rendered helpless. For a few minutes, his mouth is disengaged from his brain. Before long, he is stripped of all dignity and self-respect and, in extreme cases, he awakes the following morning to discover that he must remortgage his house. It has wrecked marriages and destroyed careers. The full Latin name is Perdus Vinus Transit but it has become known to social workers as Black Tie Swally Syndrome. The victim, typically a 45-year-old west-of-Scotland male, and having hammered the sauvignon at a fundraising dinner, suddenly convinces himself that he really must have the signed Duntocher Hibs away top. He may be of modest income and be normally circumspect in drink and relationships, but when he is overtaken by BTS Syndrome he convinces himself that he is Nelson Rockefeller III and will sacrifice the home-loan repayment on an auction prize of often dubious provenance. The malady is airborne and usually carried from victim to victim by a fast-talking Glaswegian compere. Moving smoothly from table to table and with a grin like Nosferatu's, he spots his victims in the twinkle of an eye: the lolling tongue and the stained tuxedo. The refulgent Matalan slip-on shoes. Often, there will be a nervous female partner, praying silently for some other bampot to outbid her partner's two grand for the paintball day and dinner for two at the Raj Mataj Tandoori Palace. The malady resurfaced last week and, in a sinister development, seems to have mutated. For it now appears that you don't need to be howling with the bevvy and you may indeed be affluent and successful. It happened at a fundraiser for the SNP in Glasgow among the city's Asian community. In a particularly virulent attack, the victim was swiftly incapacitated. Within moments, he'd successfully bid £9,000 for lunch with Alex Salmond at Holyrood. Another victim even agreed to pay £2,000 for lunch with his deputy, Nicola Sturgeon, an admittedly brilliant politician but whose stare can freeze the balls off a charging rhino at 50 paces. So far, the names of the afflicted haven't been released, but they are believed to be back in the bosoms of their families and undergoing counselling. They know that on some dreadful day over the next few weeks, a letter will arrive bearing the unmistakable stamp of Bute House. They will have to relive the trauma of that dark night. Then they must face the prospect of lunch with the first minister himself. Mr Salmond, an able man, but never knowingly reticent in self-promotion, will talk about the broad hinterland of his life experience that prepared him for the role of Scotland's saviour. Our victim will be approaching a critical juncture at this point in the meal. For soon, Mr Salmond will begin to discuss renewable energy and why he is proud that on his watch, Scotland has reduced her carbon footprint from a size five to a very petite and thoroughly responsible size two and a half. The lowest since records began 18 months ago. ""Soon we will have to get the elves to make our shoes because they have become so small,"" Mr Salmond will say, and he will chortle away happily as his aides nod sagely to each other. But at this point, his lunch date will remember that he paid £9,000 for this. He may begin to shake uncontrollably. The distressing scenes at the fund-raiser have led to a minor scandal in Scottish politics. Should the first minister be using Holyrood in this tawdry manner to fill the party's coffers? The news occurred on the same day that the full extent of Westminster MPs' expenses fiddling was revealed in all its malign splendour. By comparison, Salmond's folly over the auctioned-off comestibles was utterly insignificant. Black Tie Swally Syndrome campaigners have been pressing the government to fund research into the condition and they fear that the political fall-out has smothered their medical concerns. March and April are the danger months for BTS Syndrome and campaigners are keen to raise awareness of this baleful night-time curse. As we pull away from winter's icy embrace and into spring's gossamer caresses, we feel better about our surroundings. All over the kingdom, invitations will land for very worthy and understandable charitable events and we will feel well-disposed to them. And so, in a spirit of compassion, I have decided to reveal my own brush with the baleful curse of the Black Tie Swally. It is a cautionary tale and not shared lightly. I hope ­others may learn from my errors. The evening had started well. Old friends, sparkling conversation and wine glasses being replenished smartly. A loquacious and charismatic table host was kindly footing the bill and the talk was of football, gangsters and the new Versace range at House of Fraser. There was even a patina of boutique Glasgow glamour about the event: was that not Justin and Colin charming Michelle Mone to her sequined foundation garments? Then the auction started and my problems began. A shadow had descended upon me and with it came a euphoria that was a mere phantasm of my addled brain. Mesmerised by the gimlet eyes of a sharp-talking and velvet-suited auctioneer, I found myself raising my right arm. I have a hazy recollection of the sum of £500. The next morning, I woke to a Mitre 5 football signed by the triumphant Partick Thistle team who had avoided relegation for three seasons in a row in the Nineties. My head was echoing to the dark lyrics of the Animals' House of the Rising Sun. In despair, I placed it in the cupboard with my previous Black Tie follies: a year-long season ticket for First Bus, a manicure from Chez Agnes and executive hospitality at Maryhill Juniors for a home game in December.","Have tux, will make total ass of myself | Kevin McKenna",2010-02-07T00:06:55Z,Kevin McKenna,politics
"Credit to the Tories for one thing: they are ­displaying a charmingly original ­approach to ­political choreography. The ­traditional sequence for the U-turn is to promise one thing before the election, only to backtrack afterwards. Call it the Westminster two-step. But here comes David Cameron, always impatient with the old ways of doing business, to speed up the process. He's shown that you can execute a full flip-flop months before, rather than after, polling day. Why wait to be in government when you can U-turn right now? So having promised an ""age of ­austerity"", with drastic cuts the defining difference between a profligate Labour party and the belt-tightening Tories, the Conservative leader now promises any first-year cuts to public spending will not be ""particularly extensive"", and ­definitely not ""swingeing"". Rather, he and shadow chancellor George Osborne will be content simply to take a nibble out of the deficit, ""making a start"". For a party that has been taunting Labour for months, accusing it last week of ""moral cowardice"", insisting it must act fast and tough to slash the deficit, that is quite a reverse. It suggests that, for all their mockery of Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling, the Tories have now accepted Labour's view – that to cut too hard and too hastily risks choking off any recovery before it has started. Perhaps it was the chill air of Davos that cleared the minds of Cameron and Osborne. Or maybe they noticed that almost everyone else at the Swiss resort last week shared the Darling-Brown position: that the risks of cutting too early far outweighed the risks of cutting too late. It's possible that it was purely a political rather than economic calculation. The Tories might have spotted that the axe-wielding message was not playing too well with the focus groups, that it evoked in the public the image that most terrifies Cameron & Co – that he and his party are ""the same old Tories"". They'll hope to have remedied that now, by promising to be modest and gentle and to use only a little knife. But that leaves them with another problem: they have drained some of the clear blue water that separated them from Labour. That's the trouble with U-turns. You end up swapping one problem for another, losing credibility in the ­process. Cameron already has some experience of this, having started the year with an equally embarrassing volte face. First he promised to reward marriage in the tax code, then he­ ­downgraded the promise, then it was restored again. Sort of. Even he had to admit he had ""messed up"". The result is that a probable three months out from the election, the Tories are showing a cluster of weak spots at which Labour can gleefully take aim. One Downing Street official is already licking his lips at the prospect of branding the Tories' marriage proposal the John Terry tax break: ""He's going to get it: is that right, is that fair?"" Gags aside, this adds up to a serious vulnerability for the Conservatives. They have been all over the place on the economy, repeatedly changing tack since the financial crisis exploded in late 2008. The voters are noticing. Witness the latest ComRes survey which showed the Conservative lead over Labour slipping to just seven points, with waning confidence in the Tories' economic plans a key factor: 82% of voters want Cameron to be clearer on his plans for the economy; and 69% reject the notion that, had they been in power, the Tories would have ended the recession any sooner. The problem for Cameron is that his wobbling is not confined to the economy. There's a pattern here, in which the one thing consistent about the Tories is their inconsistency. ""Vote blue, go green"", the early, eco-version of Cameron urged; yet two-thirds of planning applications to build wind turbines are rejected by Tory councils. That's the policy equivalent of riding a bicycle followed by a car that carries your bags. (Further green embarrassment came yesterday, when Osborne announced that Lord Stern, an authority on the ­economics of climate change, was on board as an adviser, only for his lordship, moments later, to issue a statement denying any such thing.) It's hug a hoodie one moment, build a floating jail the next. Cameron boasts of transparency out of one side of his mouth, only to stonewall questions about the residency of his party's ultra-generous donor, Lord Ashcroft, out of the other. Still, nearly a decade after he was ennobled, the Tory party won't say if their sugar daddy – who is helping to fund the Tories' big push in marginal seats – is resident in the UK for tax purposes. It has now emerged that Ashcroft is not only the Conservatives' deputy chairman, he is also a de facto member of the party's foreign affairs team. Last year he flew William Hague to Havana on his private jet, hosted him on his yacht, then accompanied him at meetings with Cuban government officials. Handy for Ashcroft, who has major business interests in the region. But an odd way for Hague, who could be foreign secretary in May, to conduct himself. It goes on. Truly, the Conservatives are the gift that keeps on giving. If it isn't the revelation that would-be MP and pin-up Zac Goldsmith was until last year a non-dom, it's the clandestine Tory effort to merge with Northern Ireland's unionist parties – which would surely make a Cameron government ineligible for the vital role of peace broker between unionists and nationalists that London has played for more than a decade. (I'm told this has disquieted the Americans, who fear that if a prime minister Cameron can't do that job, they'll have to.) All this cheers Labour, which looks on January 2010 as the first month it has ""won"" for years. The party is left with dilemmas – does the spending U-turn force it into a weaker line of attack, casting the Tories not as rightwing cutters but as mere wobblers? – but they are nice dilemmas to have. Nevertheless, it is not just Labour that needs to rethink. In his State of the Union address last week, Barack Obama named the media alongside bankers and politicians as groups that had failed the public. If that is true there, it is surely true here. With a few honourable exceptions, most of the media has let these revelations about the Conservatives pass. David Cameron has boasted that the City is in his blood, that he is the son and grandson of stockbrokers; one analysis showed that the next House of Commons is set to include a cohort of 50 Tory MPs drawn from the City or the ­financial services industry. Yet both these stories – which cast a revealing light on the priorities of a future Cameron administration – were barely picked up. Imagine what the British press would have done with equivalent revelations about, say, Neil Kinnock's Labour party in 1983. Just one of those stories would have been enough to shred the challenger alive. But barely a glove is laid on the Tories. The broadcasters don't insist that Cameron give them a straight answer on Ashcroft, for instance; most don't even ask the question. If we're not careful, we will find ourselves some time around 2023 watching former prime minister Cameron giving evidence before an inquiry into some policy disaster, and we will wonder why he was not submitted to serious scrutiny before he was handed the keys to No 10. That job belongs, among others, to the press.

"Last Wednesday morning dawned grey and irritable in Cumbernauld and the sons and grandsons of John Leach stooped slightly to bear his remains to their final resting place. It had been a sombre yet uplifting requiem mass to mark the passing of a good life lived to the brim. Even so, the choice of the final hymn even by the studied irony of west of Scotland standards, did seem a mite on the jaunty side. ""Give me joy in my heart,"" gives way to a chorus of ""sing hosanna to the king of kings"". Had the song been chosen merely owing to the deceased's commitment to the alternative version where ""Henrik Larsson is the king of kings""? The following day, Scotland would wake to the news that Pope Benedict XVI will visit Glasgow and Edinburgh in September, the first time a pope has been here since John Paul II visited in 1982. The smiling Polish Karol Wojtyla's June visit was bathed in sunshine and a shared optimism with a confident church. When his successor lands, he will find a Catholic church rudderless, in disarray and in full retreat. In post-Christian Scotland, there are many who will relish the current status of the Catholic church as an irrelevant and idiosyncratic sideshow on the nation's cultural stage. Wiser minds will conclude, though, that the church's decline and fall will have a negative impact in several areas of Scottish life. In the weeks leading up to the announcement of Benedict's visit, a bizarre little spat broke out among factions in the church. The source of the trouble seems to have been some ecclesiastical toff claiming that Scottish bishops were less than enthusiastic about the forthcoming papal visit owing to fears that Benedict will be forcing them all to say the mass in Latin. On the ""Who Gives a Flying Toss?"" scale of fatuousness, it's up there with Peter Andre's ""My Top 10 Artistic Influences"". As the letters page of the Herald thrummed with indignant Catholics debating the finer points of liturgical exegesis, in the real world tens of thousands were dying horrible deaths in Haiti. The problems in the Scottish Catholic church start at the top and trickle down through a demoralised clergy and an alienated faithful. Each of the country's eight bishops appears to be operating in his own fiefdom. There is no unity of purpose in their duty to provide an authentic, prophetic voice to Christians specifically and to the people of Scotland generally. Since the death of the formidable Cardinal Thomas Joseph Winning in 2001 a vacuum has opened up and the enemies of the church have poured through the subsequent breach in the defences. On Margo MacDonald's sinister End of Life Choices Bill, there has been no intellectually coherent and philosophically sound Christian response from the church. The argument for retaining separate Catholic schools in 21st-century Scotland has been lost. Consequently, Catholic education, the foundation of the faith in Scotland, may well become largely obsolete within a generation. The process is happening on the watch of the current hierarchy. This failure stems from an inability to form cogent and articulate arguments for the Christian ethos in an unforgiving marketplace of competing philosophies and beliefs. The age of deference to men of the cloth has long gone and for that may the good Lord be praised. On numerous occasions, we have witnessed through cracks in our fingers the sight of Catholic clergymen, spin doctors and lay people being roasted under relentless questioning by an interlocutor for whom an appeal to ancient Judaeo-Christian verities cuts no ice. This failure to construct unsentimental and rational arguments for the church's teachings on human sexuality, education, stem cell research, abortion and euthanasia has failed their people and left the nation beyond diminished. And then there is the gay conundrum… and no, this one dare not speak its name in church circles either. And it is this: the Catholic church has signally failed to cope with the idea that tens of thousands of its adherents and dozens of its clergy are gay. According to the church, either all of these people are perversely pretending to be gay or God is playing games with them by making them gay but forbidding them from any physical expression of it. A church which unequivocally condemns gay relationships nevertheless is a magnet for young gay Catholic men who feel they can subjugate their sexuality in a celibate environment. The Catholic church is in complete denial over this. Thus the morale of many in the Catholic clergy can rarely have been lower. Even more disturbing is the existence of a toxic and evil little association of social misfits operating at the church's outer limits who are making it their business to ""out"" priests they suspect of being gay. The Spanish Inquisition was as benign as Chilcot in comparison with this ugly little shower. Indeed, when Benedict meets his Scottish lieutenants, he may want to know why there are far fewer priests around than when John Paul came to call. The Catholic church has never released the actual figures but the evidence of serious depletion is not hard to find. Some of the largest city parishes in Scotland now have one and perhaps two priests ministering to the spiritual needs of several thousand souls where once it was three or four. The increasing secularisation of society is the reason most often given for the impoverished numbers, but this merely scrapes the surface of a far bigger problem. The Catholic church's lamentable attempts to address the widespread incidence of sex abuse by clergy have led to a devastating belief in some quarters that it is almost institutional. In these circumstances, why would any Catholic teenager, no matter how devout, want to enter a seminary, even if Scotland had one? For the first time since the restoration of the hierarchy in 1878, there is no indigenous training facility in the country. One of the finest priests I ever met (and a very robust and skilful amateur footballer) had to leave his ministry more than 10 years ago because he fell in love with a woman. His God-given leadership skills among the young, the poor and the elderly have thus been lost to the church at a time when they needed them most. There are dozens like him. Yet there is nothing in the church's faith and tradition that insists on universal imposed celibacy. The sense of resentment among existing Catholic clergy at Rome's wooing of Anglican priests, lock, stock and wife, while denying them a nuptial relationship is deep. The decline of the Catholic church carries grave consequences for the people of Scotland. At risk is an entire social work infrastructure that deals with the most difficult cases in many regions. Its schools attain astonishing results in some of Glasgow's most disadvantaged urban areas. There is a hinterland of voluntary and charity work underpinned by an authentic Christian socialism which gave us the Labour party. All of this is at risk. There is a sense of crisis in the Scottish church and so I have a couple of wee suggestions for Pope Benedict, if he'll pardon my boldness. He must send out a few scouts from the Vatican prior to his visit so that he can be given an independent appraisal of the problems. And he must be prepared to conduct a root-and-branch review of the hierarchy and its performance. If that means ""retiring"" half of them, so be it. And if he could get the Vatican museum to sell off a couple of Rembrandts to help the Celtic transfer kitty… well, that might soften the pain of change.",Pope Benedict must bang heads together in his riven Scottish church | Kevin McKenna,2010-01-31T00:06:54Z,Kevin McKenna,world
"What makes us happy? Difficult to say, but for those who respond to lamentation and hand-wringing, the misery of British children has become a limitless source of distraction. Since 2006, when an open letter, orchestrated by two experts on ""toxic childhood"", and signed by more than 100 worthies, announced that modern life is harmful to children, any book or study that confirms this picture has found a ready audience, sympathetic to claims that poor morals and computer games, capitalism and fatty food, working mothers and slutty-looking dolls have somehow combined to bring about a crisis. The Archbishop of Canterbury says children are made to grow up too quickly. David Cameron, on the other hand, says they are mollycoddled. On the toxicity of child thongs, mercifully, there appears to be a degree of consensus. A prohibition on inappropriate underwear for the under-10s is expected to feature prominently in the coming Conservative manifesto. If alarmists disagree over its causes, the fact of pervasive child unhappiness has been pretty much an axiom since a 2007 Unicef survey, An Overview of Child Well-being in Rich Countries, placed the UK last in a survey of 21 nations, prompting headlines such as ""Britain's children are unhappiest in the western world"". Horrifyingly, more than a quarter of the British children surveyed (27%) had agreed with the statement: ""I often feel depressed."" The head of the Children's Society, Bob Reitemeier, said: ""We simply cannot ignore these shocking findings."" The report, he said, was ""a wake-up call to the fact that, despite being a rich country, the UK is failing children and young people in a number of crucial ways"". Until last week, that is, when a national survey by the Children's Society revealed findings from a new survey, Understanding Children's Well-being. At first, headlines such as ""One in 10 children is unhappy"" suggested that it contained the usual causes for hysteria and corrective proposals, such as tax breaks for marriage or compulsory extreme conkers. Even the society's press release, ""Family conflict significantly harms children's happiness"", indicated that broken Britain was up to its usual tricks, ruining young lives. Only at the end of the press release did the same Mr Reitemeier say: ""It shows the vast majority of our children are happy."" You do not have to be a follower of Martyn Lewis, the patron saint of good news, to wonder why this cheerful finding was received with conspicuously less enthusiasm than earlier reports that vast numbers of children are depressed. Of course, we mustn't be hasty. You can't be sure, on the basis that nine out of 10 children profess themselves fairly happy, that British childhood might be a bit unwholesome, rather than viciously toxic. They might be too toxic to trust. But, even so, the authors of this fascinating report presumably want to be believed when they say: ""The first point to make is that most young people are faring relatively well and that the proportion who tend to be unhappy is a minority."" Faring well? When, three years ago, inequality, alcoholism and poor sex education were among the many things agreed to be ruining their lives? If a general mood swing on that scale does not prompt some reflection, there must be a suspicion that a belief in pervasive childish misery is hard for some adults to relinquish. Perhaps the widespread faith in toxicity is, as occasionally suggested, more of a moral panic than a reasoned approach to child welfare. Have campaigners and politicians projected their own anxieties about contemporary life on to children, Rousseau-style, regardless of developments that probably make growing up more enjoyable for many children than it ever was in the past? An increased respect for children's views, for instance, probably explains why the new survey contrasts so strongly with its predecessors. This time, researchers rejected the conventional ""adultcentric"" approach, in favour of one that investigated well-being from a child's perspective. Thus some sources of distress, writ large in earlier studies, have receded. Family poverty and family structure, in this report, made only a ""marginal"" contribution to reported ""lower well-being"". What made children saddest, in this survey, was their appearance. Almost a fifth, of both sexes, were unhappy with how they looked. Instead of dwelling on thongs and conkers and bribes for spouses, you gather, campaigners for children's happiness might do better to address the reasons why, by year 10 (age 14-15), 28% of girls (and half that number of boys) are made so miserable by their appearance. If it does not appeal to David Cameron, Baroness Greenfield or the Archbishop of Canterbury, this finding is likely to register, at least, with women who have recently been denouncing excessive airbrushing and size zero or endorsing, more volubly since the French took against it, the ""freedom"" to wear a niqab or burka. Perhaps the most effective argument for this form of oppression, is that, in liberating young women from the pressure to display, it accords with feminist principles. Naomi Wolf, for example, is a feminist who recently had a go with a veil. ""I felt a novel sense of calm and serenity,"" she wrote. ""I felt, yes, in certain ways free."" Preposterous as this is, it is an argument that can only prevail where so many western women feel physically inadequate. Tellingly or not, the new survey found that unhappiness about appearance was less pronounced among black and Asian children. The Children's Society cannot elaborate at this stage on what makes young white girls in particular become so exercised about their appearance, but their research conforms with mounting evidence that, in a post-feminist age, women have become more self-conscious about their looks, rather than less. A study by the Girl Guides recently discovered that 46% of girls aged 11 to 16 would consider cosmetic surgery and that girls started to find fault with their appearance as early as 10 or 11. If this development does not compare for drama with the earlier findings on all-round social and parental neglect, it does, unlike capitalism or marriage, at least look like a specific fault that could be addressed; demonstrating along the way that there is some middle way between looking like Cheryl Cole and wearing a shroud. Admittedly, even with women working in senior management, it has taken the BBC decades to concede that the sight of an older woman need not, if done carefully, cause televisions to spontaneously combust. But there is no reason why, in time, the homely and imperfect should not also be carefully reintroduced to screens and other places where man has made them extinct, rather as one might restore rare breeds to the wild. It's possible, of course, that a general assault on discrimination by looks would make absolutely no difference to the toxicity of British childhood. Children might be as unhappy, or happy, as ever. But it's more promising than campaigning for conkers or, for that matter, burkas.",Why are so many young girls still being lured into the beauty trap? | Catherine Bennett,2010-01-31T00:06:50Z,Catherine Bennett,society
"British political history is a story of peaks and troughs. Between the Pitts, Gladstones and Lloyd Georges are dead zones when politics seemed to rest and take stock. The fields lay fallow as leaders relaxed and followers caught up. For the Tory party, few zones have been more fallow than the two decades since Margaret Thatcher's fall in 1990. That period appears to be ending. But is David Cameron a Disraeli-in-waiting, a Churchill-in-the-wings, even a Thatcher c1975? Or is he more a Tony Blair, who rectified his party's past ­errors in opposition but proved a disappointment in office? Tim Bale's study of the Conservative party since 1990 is like a guidebook to a haunted house. Party officials roamed Westminster seeking exorcism from the ghosts of Thatcher. The party, once the supreme postwar electoral machine, collapsed and endured a prolonged nervous breakdown. The tale does not make easy reading. Opposition is a soulless business at a time when issues no longer divide the nation. It is largely a matter of news management, drawing comfort (or misery) from opinion polls as the electorate grows gradually bored with the party in power. It is a time, above all, of waiting. Under John Major, in power from 1990-97, the failure to refresh Thatcher's themes of privatisation, a slimmer welfare state and anti-corporatism in Europe left the Conservative party split and bad-tempered. Defeat in 1997 was all but inevitable. Worse for the Tories was that Blair at Downing Street and Gordon Brown at the Treasury stole every garment in the Tory locker. They stuck to Ken Clarke's Treasury policies, were tough on crime, tough on teachers, tough on immigrants, tough on scroungers and eager for war anywhere it might occur. The Tories simply had nowhere to go. The search for route maps, often mere passing gimmicks, became relentless. William Hague (1997-2001) thrashed about between ""rockers"" and ""modernisers"", seeking somewhere to pitch camp just to the right of the ""muddled middle"". He launched projects with names such as ""Listening to Britain"", ""Kitchen Table Conservatism"", ""Common Sense"". Each was more desperate than the last to distance the party from ""nasty party"" Thatcherism. Yet as the aspiring leader, Michael Portillo, observed at the time, ""You cannot ditch policies that succeeded so convincingly that they were adopted by our opponents, and much of the free world."" When something called Project Hague crashed at the polls in 2001, the party's bizarre electoral system chose assisted suicide with Iain Duncan Smith, who lasted less than a year. With its leader stumbling at every fence, he was dumped and MPs reverted to the vigorous but unelectable Thatcherite Michael Howard, more plausible candidates having deserted the field. A third defeat in 2005 came almost as blessed release. Not until the choice of Cameron at the end of 2005 did the Conservatives properly address the demands of the new politics and choose not a programme or a message but a charismatic leader. The clouds duly parted and the sun shone. After the short-lived Brown bounce of 2007, and the ""Cameron wobble"", the sky was clear ahead with, we assume, a happy ending to be had by all. What Bale does not explain is why the party remained stuck with an archaic obsession with policy and failed completely to concentrate on finding a leader likely to appeal to the electorate, as in Michael Heseltine, Clarke or Portillo. It plunged into arguing over where it stood on the political spectrum, dabbling in such nerdish concepts as preference shaping, valences and ""the politics of and"". It allowed a fixation with Europe to rule its counsels. Bale concludes that the party's failure could be put down to ""complacency and self-obsession"". It was ""too rightwing, too nasty, too out-of-touch . . . unable to break with the Thatcherite past"". Yet the central predicament that faced Conservatism after the 1992 election, when Major won more popular votes than any prime minister in history, was that it did not lose the argument but won it. As Blair and Brown privately conceded after their American and Australian pilgrimages, there was ""no alternative"" to Thatcher's re-engineering of the public sector, no return to penal taxes and severe fiscal redistribution. Having accepted the Thatcher medicine, the electorate were content to choose a new and more glamorous custodian than the Tories could offer. Blair was unbeatable. Bale does not analyse the Blair phenomenon or the change wrought on British government by his and Brown's conversion to Thatcherism in the early 1990s. I sense the reason is that he, like most political commentators, is still mesmerised by the idea of 1997 as a ""political watershed"", by the bipolarity of the Westminster village. He cannot see Blair's election as merely a change in guardian of the ark of Thatcher's covenant. Not for nothing was the lady the first former prime minister through Blair's Downing Street door, and fêted alike by Brown. Come 2006, Bale explains that ""the most obvious difference between Cameron and his predecessors relates to strategy,"" coupled with a refusal to promise upfront tax cuts and spending restraint. This is not the case. The difference was that Cameron was an electable politician. Two decades spent by the party in the company of pollsters, policy wonks and spin doctors should have been spent with a good head-hunter. The Tories throughout these years were stuck, as I sense Bale was, in the hothouse of Westminster. Politics was viewed through the prism of what De Tocqueville called ""the club, not the mob"", men and women hopelessly detached from an electorate who were contented with new Labour and its leader's style. There was really nothing the Tories could do. They might as well have lain on the beach for the duration. Bale is left narrating the tribulations of what was in reality a leader and cabinet in waiting. His narrative is masterly and his judgments sound. He has produced a useful account of what it is like to be an opposition shut up for 20 years in the Palace of Westminster. But the exercise is essentially as tedious as was the waiting. Now at least the waiting appears to be over.

"Ohmygod the book is dead – yet again. ­Another assassin, the iPad, wings its way across the Atlantic, sowing shock and awe and bringing angels of death to mainstream everything. Those still smearing black gunge on dead trees are portrayed as Hare Krishna nutters, banging the drum for the old religion. They are so completely yesterday. Whataboy, Jobs. Buy Apple. Gimme another freebie. New computers are sold with the same hype that used to attend each year's new cars. Instead of half-naked women, we get an audience of screaming Apple-heads. Instead of Jeremy Clarkson in ecstasy on a Mediterranean hairpin, we get the gasping techno-reporter, ""one of a small group of people to be given a sneak hands-on preview"" (the Guardian), declaring that ""other e-companies had better look out"" (the Times). Apple's chief Steve Jobs is depicted by his publicists as the iconic nerd, staged in designer stubble and moving through the throng like a black-shirted extra from The Matrix. ""It's so cool, I don't care,"" incants an anonymous tweeter, probably some computer-disseminated advertising copy. Back in 1996 the business guru Peter Drucker asserted in Wired magazine that the internet would make money for Microsoft and Intel, while everyone else would lose a fortune. Money would go to those who grabbed early monopolies, but overall ""the industry won't make a dime"". Most participants will survive on venture capital until, sooner or later, the bubble bursts and the market flattens. People expect anything onscreen to be free – but the world cannot eat free. For the most part, Drucker was right. The breakneck advance of hand-held internet devices is impressive, but the money lies mostly in selling plastic. The myriad internet millionaires of the 1990s have vanished. Venture capitalists came and went, badly bloodied. Outriders such as Amazon, Facebook and Twitter capture attention and glitz, as did lastminute and others in the early days, but you can scan coverage of these companies and find not a mention of profit. The internet remains enveloped in left-wing theorising about free-to-air, as if an entire industry could defy the tenets of market capitalism. Most internet-based companies survive on inducing indulgent bankers or governments to spend someone else's money on ventures few of which will make money. They fondly hope that one day the much abused advertising industry will come to their rescue. Online charging is still in its infancy. Put another way, internet start-ups are like Manchester City. As long as the sugar daddy is ready to lose his shirt, the party keeps rolling. The same investor scepticism as is now shown towards Detroit cars and supersonic jets should be directed at anything beginning with ""i"" or ""e"". The dotcom bubble diverted billions of pounds from more productive investment. It drained pension funds of cash and hired and fired thousands of young graduates, the few survivors now mostly concentrating on gambling. The craze for inappropriate e-government has taxed the British public sector an estimated £26bn. Trollope's The Way We Live Now is alive and well and living in Whitehall as well as California. I regard the laptop and the mobile phone as boons and welcome novelty. Some innovations will win and some lose. My bible in these matters – The Shock of the Old, by David Egerton of Imperial College – is a catalogue of product failure and a sound corrective to techno-dazzle, but it does not undermine the importance of innovation. The fact that Concorde, drip-dry shirts and food pills proved commercial blind alleys does not invalidate the virtues of the world wide web. Likewise I have been trying e-books – as I have e-newspapers – for 20 years and have no doubt that they will find some niche in the marketplace. But print on paper has outlasted every ­obituarist. Nothing – from the advent of radio and television to the rise of the paperback, the collapse of price maintenance, the ""demise"" of the local bookshop and now electronic publishing – has dented its appeal. The press is supposedly cast in gloom, largely through the waning of the boost of investment and pagination that followed the Wapping and computing rev­olutions of the 1980s. But British quality papers sold just 1.4m copies a day in 1947, before the television boom. This rose to peak at 2.7m in 1985, was 2.6m in 2001, and even today is only down to 2.1m. This is a long way from death. The overwhelming bulk of newspaper revenue still comes from people who want to buy and/or advertise in the printed product. No advertising, including on television and the internet, is doing well at present. There will be changes to product and price. But to forecast the demise of something so clearly wanted as writing printed on paper is absurd. The assumption involved in the e-book is that Milton's ""precious ­lifeblood of a master spirit"" is merely a bundle of words, best delivered to the reader as swiftly and efficiently as ­possible. The internet salesman may scream that ""the web will give every housewife the Library of Congress on her kitchen table""; but, as one wit replied, she wants a recipe that does not fail when doused in flour or gravy. She still wants a Model-T, not a Rolls-Royce. Geoffrey Nunberg's cult study of the book, published in 1996, asserted as fact that ""bound, printed volumes … will likely disappear soon"". Since then, bound, printed volume production has soared to record levels. In 2009, when most industries went to rock bottom, the number of titles published in the UK reached a new record of 133,000 (against just 14,000 in the ""golden"" interwar years). Volume was also a record 5.8m copies. When American e-titles began to boom after 2000, the number of printed titles rose rather than fell. Part of this must be attributable to book sales being overwhelmingly for gifts, with 60%-70% of most publishers' output being sold in the two months before Christmas. I see no harm in this. For reasons that are aesthetic as much as practical, books are popular presents. That helps explain the robustness of the hardback and picture book, widely regarded as doomed in the 1960s. I watched the advent of the electronic ""flat tablet"" three decades ago (at the Knight-Ridder media lab in Colorado). It failed. It has been followed by hopefuls galore, down to today's Palms, Kindles, Nooks and iPads. Each electronic innovation appears to have ­enhanced the appeal of print on paper rather than replaced it, much as internet reproduction has increased the appeal of live performance. Gutenberg has yet to be bettered. A book is an indestructible, self-sufficient product, its character reflecting the genius of one creative mind. As long as words are written and people can read, settling down with a book remains an intimate sharing of sensibility. It delights the eye, as a shelf of books ­furnishes a room. It offers escape from the ubiquitous screen. I am amused that each development of the e-book renders its pages more like print on paper. Its LED gets more like daylight, its page-turning more finger-friendly, its packaging more appealing. I am sure a Californian boffin will one day invent an e-book that needs no electricity and has floppy pages you can dog-ear. He might even call it a book.","Palms, Kindles, Nooks, iPads – none are as cool as Gutenberg's gadget | Simon Jenkins",2010-01-29T08:00:00Z,Simon Jenkins,world
"If I ran a university today I would be very afraid. Lord ­Mandelson, with all the power of his Cromwellian interregnum, has told universities that the next academic year will be ­financially savage. They must expect less money from the ­government, ­period. Since nobody votes for ­Mandelson, he can say and do anything he wants, even before an election. This is a rare moment of political truth. Student numbers, which rose by 10,000 this year, have peaked at 43% of the age cohort, with Labour's target of 50% in higher education unachieved. The talk is now of fewer numbers, fines for over-recruitment, two-year courses, 20% of cuts in research money and 4,000 jobs at risk. With one in three graduates now forced to take a ""non-graduate job"", universities will find it hard to plead any economic fruitfulness. While hospitals and schools enjoy political protection, universities are defenceless against the coming storm. This is excellent news, but only if… following the last great cutback in 1980-2 British universities signed a pact with the devil, in the person of Margaret Thatcher's education secretary, Lord Baker. In the Education Reform Act 1988 they sold their academic souls for money and placed their independence at the disposal of Whitehall. They submitted to Baker's demand that they ""accord with the economy's needs"" and come ""closer to the world of business"". If they disagreed, the government would decide, from year to year, ""whether the planning framework should be adjusted"". It was a typical Thatcher lurch into Leninism. Universities now face another 1988 moment: should they again knuckle down to the diktat of government, or should they break free? There is no question what Mandelson and, for sure, the Tories will want. It is more control, probably in return for a small rise in fees and in grant. In setting up the Browne review of university finance last autumn, Mandelson said the job of universities was ""to fill skills gaps in the economy"". Research grants would be assessed on ""impact on the economy and society"", and funds would be directed to the ""stem"" subjects – science, technology, engineering and maths. Mandelson wanted a battery of new data controls – recording how effectively lecturers teach, how much their graduates earn, and the social background of their students. To a chorus from the Russell Group of 20 top universities demanding a rise in the fee cap of £3,290, he hinted consent, but the theme is constant. Universities must remain his lackeys. The brainwashing effect on Bristol's vice-chancellor, Eric Thomas, was instant. He promised to teach ""the unemployed … to be an appropriately skilled and educated workforce for our future economy and to escape recession"". What is forgotten is that British universities are legally private. Even Thatcher dared not nationalise them. Their lack of autonomy lies in the reliance of most of them on the government for money. Government grants cover half their total income of £23bn. The customers – students – contribute only £1.2bn. For the users of any service to pay so small a proportion of its costs is unsustainable. Universities have become no different to hospitals, except that with hospitals, taxpayers know what they are buying. The future of university independence is bound up in fee income. This is currently so low as to bear no relation to the cost of a degree, especially in science subjects. Oxford and Cambridge subsidise their fees by £6,000-£7,000 per student a year, costing them each roughly £60m even after a similar government teaching grant. They can just afford it, but most universities cannot. When top-up fees (paid by students) were introduced in 2006 it was thought they would curb access from working-class homes. But the Office of Fair Access admits that has not proved the case. The £2.5bn to meet Gordon Brown's fixation with ""wider access"" has achieved hardly a blip in the social background graph, while consuming a reported £211,000 per extra working-class student recruited: classic wasted money from another dysfunctional Whitehall quango. Student fees are paid in pain and at the point of delivery. Their erosion in the 1960s and 1970s was engineered by the Treasury to increase university dependence on teaching grants, and thus aid central planning. In contrast top-up fees led to student revolts against poor teaching, such as at Bristol last year. Accountability suddenly began to bite – more effectively than through Mandelson's inspectors. Most universities now want the fee cap raised to £5,000 or £7,000 – or removed altogether so they can ­compete for students in the marketplace. If the latter, the Russell Group has proposed that the top rate might be some £15,000 for wealthy families (still cheaper than a private secondary school) to cross-subsidise poor ones. At a certain level, the government's central teaching grant would no longer be required, or could be converted into a national bursary scheme. The issue is not the level of the fee but the custodianship of the revenue. As long as universities receive any central teaching grants, they will be beholden to government for every aspect of undergraduate policy. As long as the government regards university finance as a branch of social engineering, it will hold down fees to curry favour with students and keep universities on direct grant rations. Universities now have a real opportunity to break free of 20 years of this ­subservience. Research is being ever more ­concentrated on Russell Group institutions, and higher education will revert in time to the ""binary"" system initiated in the 1960s by ­Labour's Tony Crosland and ­extravagantly abolished by Thatcher's Tories. The rest of higher education should be liberated from bureaucratic ""research assessment"" and become mostly ­vocational, local and home-based. Full fees with bursaries to meet the public requirement for equity, would let them ignore ministerial speeches, Whitehall monitors and socio-political agendas. They could do what they are supposed to do – teach those who come to their door what they want to learn, and make their own decisions on how to finance it. University governing bodies are notorious for their conservatism and pusillanimity to government. Here is a brief window through which they might escape and be true to themselves.",It's another 1988 moment. Universities can break free | Simon Jenkins,2010-01-26T21:00:01Z,Simon Jenkins,politics
"Brangelina are splitting up, apparently. Or are they? I do hope not, as I can hardly bear to see them revert to their original names, whatever they were. With Lina's thinness and Brange's turkey neck, they were all set to be the perfect role models to marshal us into middle age. Sorry, I don't know where that spike of unpleasantness came from. Our thoughts naturally turn to who they should go out with next, if of course their relationship doesn't last the course. Handily, a book has just been published on the topic, in which American author Lori Gottlieb advises women over 30 to settle for Mr Good Enough/Mr Right Now/Mr Insert-Any-One-of-Those-Cliches-That-Never-Caught-On . . . Just go out with someone and marry them, you bag of disappointment and bones. Being single is a young woman's game. In the author's words, ""Every woman I know – no matter how successful and ambitious, how financially and emotionally secure – feels panic, occasionally coupled with desperation, if she hits 30 and finds herself unmarried."" Sometimes in this conversation I hit so many things I don't understand that I can't remember whether I'm supposed to understand them, or they're deliberately set up so that they can't be understood. It's like playing Mornington Crescent. I don't understand how you can tell whether or not your panic is coupled with desperation (on the emotional palate, so hard to distinguish), and I don't understand the timeline. Does this happen on your 30th birthday? To real people, in the real world? It seems more like the kind of thing that would happen to Andie McDowell in an advert. It's the Retinol A of the emotional life. I don't really understand what Mr Right means, although don't tell Mr Right that. It's not new, of course; people have been telling each other for centuries what to look for in a mate. This is actually what language was invented for (would we have gone to all that trouble just to tell each other where there were boar? That time-consuming expansion of the frontal lobe, that eyeless fumbling towards metaphor? For a big hairy animal you could just point at?) Most of all, people love to dispense dating-maths. I've heard all of these things: if the balance of good to bad in your relationship is 60:40, that is enough for lifelong happiness. You will know within two months whether or not you can put up with someone for ever. If you don't know within 18 months, then the answer is no. Everybody has 12 relationships in their life so, if you get to the sixth one and it's better than the five before it, stop there, the balance of probabilities is that the seventh . . . no, hang on, this isn't right. This maths has got too sophisticated. Maybe you're supposed to carry on going to 12, decide once you have all the results in which was the best, and go back to him, destroying, if you must, any partnership he may have formed in the interim. That sounds as if it would be quite a lot of effort, but – remembering the two-month rule – you could actually get the whole lot done in two years. Even if you started at a conservative 20 years old, you could still choose in time for eight years' messing around before panic chases you down the aisle. Mr Right would have to be quite understanding, but then, of course, he is: otherwise he wouldn't be right. So anyway . . . Angelina, at 34, is well into Mr He'll Do territory. Might I suggest, if the need arises, David Mitchell, Lembit Opik and Frank Lampard. All of these would be nice compromise solutions for an internationally renowned beauty, actor and activist. Why end up single? With so much excellent advice, there's really no need. Memo to ministers: 'We don't care when the election is' Defence Secretary Bob Ainsworth just became the third government minister to blow the gaff on the date of the general election. ""I think [the British public] will rue the day if they wind up with a Conservative government in charge of this country after May 6th,"" he said, unambiguously. This brings the cat fully out of the bag, after Europe minister Chris Bryant revealed its front paws a fortnight ago, and the inexplicably annoying Andy Burnham showed its tummy two days later. The huge secret has been common knowledge in Westminster for months, which is the only place anyone cares. Since then, the more outspoken MPs have gradually, teasingly, revealed it, as if in a saucy scarf dance, to the public, where nobody cares at all. What Gordon Brown should have done is told us, the public, months ago, and we could have judiciously let it slip, ickle by ickle, to MPs, who would have got really excited. That's how you get a crowd going, chum. This gossip is flowing in the wrong direction. Who needs Facebook politeness?  Professor Robin Dunbar, of Oxford University, has found that Facebook does not increase the number of friends people have in real life. Even with laptops, we are still human beings and, as such, can still maintain only about 150 active friendships. If that's about all you've got on Facebook, well, perhaps you're one of those people who can only maintain 15 friendships. In Portugal, they say you have only five friends, and the rest is all landscape. I personally aim for a squad of 11, with a full reserve bench so I can sub people off when they do something annoying or get pregnant. Everybody is so obnoxiously cute to each other on Facebook, with their quizzes and their zoos and their cheery hellos. It's because it's called ""networking"". We've got our metaphorical makeup on, round our friendly party smiles. Maybe Dunbar's research will end this tyranny of Facebook politeness. They're not friends, they're just people who (probably) exist. Think of it more like driving.

"My narrow escape from a private education occurred in 1975 when my otherwise exemplary parents made me sit the entrance exam for St Aloysius College. The school occupies a lofty position in Glasgow education, sitting atop one of the highest of the hills in the heart of the city. It is where affluent and aspirational Catholics send their children and as you wander around the city centre of a lunchtime, little Sebastians and Julias in their lovely green blazers traipse desultorily among Sauchiehall Street's gaudy emporiums. For around £9,000 a year, they are exposed to the dubious rigours of a Jesuit education. A place on Glasgow University's law course is the least of their expectations and a position in Docherty, Docherty and O'Hanlon, solicitors and notaries to the archdiocese and the security industry beckons. Happily, my ability at maths was scarcely better than an HBOS trader's and so I was spared several years of short trousers, rugby and an annoying accent. The Jesuits, when they are not casting out demons and even atheists, are good at education. They have also undertaken vows of poverty, chastity and obedience so that they can dedicate themselves to the spiritual and pastoral care of we, the Fenian proletariat. Glasgow's Jesuits though, are exempt from such privations and are given leave to impart their wisdom only to families with an income of around 120k and those, like my parents, who are prepared to eat Spam fritters for a decade. It's a curiously exclusive Christianity and not perhaps what St Ignatius of Loyola had in mind when he founded his great order. So I spent five happy years at two decent but unspectacular comprehensives where, thanks to the efforts of some splendid teachers, I achieved more or less what I would have at an independent school. In Scotland, we are obsessive about the quality of our education and this is not unhealthy. For a few centuries now, we have been justly proud of our schools and, consequently, our expectations of them are mighty. They inspired a freedom of thought and expression and a rigorous pursuit of knowledge across arts and sciences. In such a crucible, ideas and formulas were wrought that helped improve the world. Yet one of the most popular parlour debates among the middle classes after climate change and disciplining children is the state of our comprehensive schools. There is a collective whine as you walk through Newton Mearns and Morningside at 10 on a Saturday night after a pert chablis from the Sunday Times wine club has just been served and it goes like this: Scottish education was once envied throughout the world, but the comprehensive system has destroyed it. The refrain will have been given an airing once more this weekend. For the Tories, in their endless quest for relevance in Scotland, are proposing a bizarre voucher system that will strengthen parents' rights to have their child educated at the school of their choice. Under this system, parents would be able to cash in vouchers for the cost of their child's education at the state school of their choice. At a stroke, it would create a three-tier state secondary education structure, consigning already faltering schools to sink status. Let's get something straight about the Tories and education. They've never really forgiven the rest of us for imposing comprehensive schools on them. Any system where every child is given an equal opportunity to shine, according to his gifts, was bound to end in the nightmare of even more working-class brats storming the citadels of higher education which the Tories once regarded as their exclusive finishing schools. Since then, they have caused an insidious lie to proliferate among the political classes: comprehensives don't work; they stifle children with ability; they encourage hooded tops from Asda; they don't teach English. Or history… Some comprehensive schools in Scotland are failing, but are not beyond recovery. The majority continue to produce heroic results, sometimes in almost impossible social circumstances. Those that need the most help are all to be found in Scotland's most deprived areas. If the government was serious about tackling this problem they should pursue the affirmative action route, where the best education graduates and most gifted headteachers are paid a premium to spend a minimum period of time, say five years, at those schools that serve our poorest areas. If the concept of all-women political shortlists can be justified to increase their representation in Parliament then so can this. Any masterplan to improve our comprehensives, though, must also address the unhealthy influence of the all-powerful teaching unions. According to these bodies, there has never been a bad teacher in Scotland. The McCrone agreement, Higher Still, the Curriculum for Excellence, the last four education ministers: it's all their fault. There are hundreds of teachers in Scotland who ought never to have been allowed within miles of a classroom. Yet parents are never given access to the car crash CVs of these people and thus will never know that their child's chances of achievement in some subjects is compromised from the first minute they set foot in the classrooms of these misfits. Any attempt to get beyond the hand-wringing over failing comprehensives, though, must also limit the unfair privileges enjoyed by the independent sector. How sickening can it be for parents on low incomes to watch graduates, whose education they have helped fund, choose to work in a private school whose fees are out of their reach? The ultimate iniquity, though, is that independent, fee-paying schools are allowed to exist at all. In democratic, equal, fair and inclusive Scotland, not enough of us find it strange that a cartel of elite schools exists solely for those privileged children born into wealth and power… and the few dozen proles they deign to admit for the purpose of preserving their wretched charitable status.",The public untruths about private schools | Kevin McKenna,2010-01-17T00:10:06Z,Kevin McKenna,politics
"This year is going to surprise us. After nearly two years of financial and economic mayhem, this will be a year of a steadily improving economy. Incredibly, over the last nine months, the stock market has recorded the third biggest rise since 1693, according to the Bank of England, and if it carries on rising just a little more in January it will be the biggest sustained rise for 317 years. A stock market cannot jump on this scale and with this ferocity without matters quickly improving on the ground. How much economic improvement will follow after 2010 and 2011 is much less obvious – but for the sharp economic recovery in prospect, be grateful. In some respects, the good news which the stock market is anticipating has already begun. Just before Christmas, the Office for National Statistics reported that unemployment as measured by the numbers applying for the Jobseekers' Allowance (JSA) had fallen 6,300. In no postwar recession has unemployment ever fallen so quickly, just 20 months after the rise began. It took 40 months before the first fall in the early 1980s. True, it is only a one-month fall. And it is also true that as the cut in VAT rate is restored – after its 13-month reduction, which has been successful in stimulating extra spending – some companies may put into place redundancy programmes which they deferred during the period of the VAT stimulus. But the deep trends are clear. Unemployment has risen much less than anybody expected; for example, the claimant count rate has been decelerating since the spring – from 25,000 a week to 3,000 a week now. The two great students of the impact of credit crunches, Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff, calculate in their remarkable book on 800 years of banking crises, This Time Is Different, that the average rise of unemployment in countries experiencing major systemic banking crises since 1930 is 7% of the workforce. In Britain, this would have meant an unemployment rise of around 1.75 million. It is not going to happen, catching everyone out, including me. Unemployment will certainly carry on rising in 2010, but the eventual rise will be around 1.25m; serious, but not as cataclysmic as it could have been. And would have been without two powerful influences. Companies and workforces have moved heaven and earth to protect jobs. Part of the story is wage freezes, wage cuts and working fewer hours, but top companies have decided that they would rather cut investment in plant than cut their investment in people. In a knowledge-based economy such as ours, skilled workers who know the company, its operations and its customers are ever more valuable, expensive to fire and expensive to replace when times get better. Business investment on the other hand can be deferred. The other powerful influence is government policy. The Labour government has been hyper-aggressive in trying to cap the rise in unemployment. It has poured resources into the Jobcentre Plus network to increase its capacity. Even during a recession of this severity, the job centres learnt of 10,000 new vacancies a day; the effort has been focused on trying to get the newly unemployed to fill the vacancies: 55% of new claimants are leaving the register within three months and 73% within six months – only fractionally lower than in normal times. There has been the £1bn Future Jobs Fund, and then the guarantee that every 18- to-24-year-old receiving JSA will get a job or training after six months. In total, £5bn has been spent – and it is working. All of this puts a floor under the economy; consumption holds up as the fear of losing a job retreats. But never underestimate the additional stimulus of a game-changing 30%-plus devaluation, again the largest since Britain left the gold standard in 1931. Under Labour, deindustrialisation proceeded even faster than under the Conservatives as Brown's love affair with the City led to an astonishing influx of foreign banks and capital, all of which pushed the exchange rate up to unprecedented levels of uncompetitiveness. Honest-to-God British companies could not compete, as the City crowded out non-financial enterprise. As the City has contracted, capital flows have shrunk and the pound has fallen. Imports are relatively expensive and are dropping fast, while in 2010 exports will start to accelerate, especially as the world economy, led by Asia and the US, rebounds. The industry we have left is highly competitive; it had to be. Growth in Britain from the dark days of the 1991 recession to the end of a disastrous 2009 has still averaged a solid 2.1% – higher than any of the big economies in Europe and Japan. There is more to the British economy, thankfully, than financial services – despite the City propaganda. Two more sources of vital stabilisation are the £200bn of cash printed by the Bank of England to flood the stricken financial system and the £178bn budget deficit. Again, these are unprecedentedly big, but faced by near banking collapse, no other response was possible. The Bank of England has had to be radical about avoiding a calamitous contraction of the money supply, and the government has had to be no less radical in maintaining public demand as private demand risked going into free fall. The banking system has been bailed out and is rapidly repairing its balance sheet. Britain is emerging comparatively lightly from what could have been a second Great Depression. For anyone who believes in government economic activism – and in the dangers posed by Big Finance – it has been a massive vindication. The government is still too deferential to City interests; for example, Alistair Darling should never have allowed the great banks to refuse to contribute to the proposed National Investment Corporation. They should have been told their refusal was unacceptable, but New Labour has little balls when it comes to bankers. Expect the bonus tax to be rescinded in three months' time. The City has been overindulged and industry neglected for too long. Britain has some great companies – there are just too few of them. Much more needs to be put in place to support innovation and growth if the next decade is to be anything other than austere and hair-shirt. And yet. We have witnessed a powerful example of how public policy can head off putative slumps. How would a Conservative government have fared? It is difficult to imagine it would have been so aggressive. I doubt it would have spent £5bn on trying to cap unemployment; it would never have implemented the timely and targeted VAT reduction; its hesitations over bailing out the banks could have seen a bank collapse; it would have been a reluctant endorser of quantitative easing; it would have tried to cap the necessary rise in the public deficit. Had it been in power, Rogoff's and Reinhart's projections would been borne out – and nearly half-a-million people more would have lost their jobs. If the Conservatives win this year, the severity of their proposed spending cuts could nip the renaissance in the bud. Tory high command thinks that the economy is one of their issues. As the feelgood factor returns as the year wears on, British voters may think twice before punishing the team that so successfully got Britain through the crisis – and risking prolonged economic stagnation. This year's gathering economic recovery could yet be one of Labour's strengths.","Despite the doom-mongers, the UK economy isn't a basket case after all | Will Hutton",2010-01-03T00:06:22Z,Will Hutton,politics
"Considering the rate at which this government gives advice, fans of Viz have often wondered why officials have been so slow to copy that magazine's regular feature, Top Tips. Perhaps ministers are afraid that Viz is an undignified place in which to look for inspiration. If so, they will be reassured by the favourite Tips compiled to celebrate the magazine's 30th anniversary. Consider this, for householders: ""Prevent burglars stealing everything in the house by moving everything into your bedroom when you go to bed. In the morning, move it all back again."" Is that so different from the hint recently offered to householders by Directgov, in a video called ""Preventing burglaries over Christmas""? ""Position Christmas trees and presents away from windows,"" Directgov advises. ""Dazzling decorations and gifts under the Christmas tree attract opportunists."" So, householders: hang your baubles out of sight, where they will not invite unwelcome attention. Or, alternatively: frustrate burglars by decorating your tree with ugly straw. Where targets for Viz advice are concerned, many are identical to the government's. Here, for instance, the magazine focuses on the poor: ""Shoes last twice as long if only worn every other day."" And cookery hints are a regular feature: ""Boil an egg to perfection without costly egg timers by popping it into boiling water and driving away from your home at exactly 60mph. After three miles, phone your wife to take the egg out of the pan."" But maybe this is preaching to the converted. At last – and it should come as no surprise that Lord Mandelson of Foy should have been the minister with the required vision – the government has recognised Top Tips as a format worth plagiarising. In ""Parent Motivators"", its newly published advice for the parents of dependent, unemployed graduates, Lord Mandelson's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills borrows this very term for its premier pieces of advice. For instance: ""Top Tip! Advise them to create a document with all their information in so they can begin to cut and paste from one main document to save time and mistakes."" This idiot-proof style, designed to assist individuals who have spent three years in higher education, is not the only way in which ""Parent Motivators"" surpasses all previous expressions of government condescension. In a decade which has seen the literature of interference explode, thanks to an unattractive combination of the internet and government shamelessness, this is first time we find educated adults in their twenties being officially infantilised; a move that is unlikely, moreover, to dispel growing suspicion about the value of many modern degrees. Can ""Parent Motivators"", some will ask, really be a more patronising document than ""Preparing for Emergencies""? True, the 2004 classic has a loyal following: many of us still keep the leaflet by our beds as a reminder, should we be overtaken by a national catastrophe, to ""make sure 999 has been called"". Others maintain that ""Break-Out"", a 2006 guide to outwitting paedophiles, remains the acme of the genre: ""Always make sure your kids tell you where they are going and arrange a set time for them to be home."" Sir Liam Donaldson's ""HeatWave"" (2005) still soothes the anxious with its ""eat as you normally would"" – a tip carelessly omitted from the new Dad Card and flatly contradicted by the Breakfast4Life toolkit (""Keep a box of wholegrain cereal, a bowl and a spoon at work""). And on a more serious note, many elderly people still struggle to comply with sex advice, also communicated in handy video form, whereby an attractive therapist tells them how highly the government prizes congress among the over-sixties. Younger citizens, too, are urged to have regular sex or, failing that, to ""bath together"". Failing even that, government sex therapist Denise Knowles urges couples to ""listen to your partner's breathing and the sounds they make"". The erotic silence that prevails in so many retirement homes is testimony, surely, to the power of this kind of public information, professionally communicated. On the face of it, ""Parent Motivators"" might seem a less impertinent intervention. Its aim, according to another freelance Denise, Denise Taylor, a psychologist who sells career advice, is to give parents of unemployed graduates ""the confidence to advise and help your son or daughter take this next big step in life"". It soon emerges that for parents with the appropriate skills, the effects of economic recession, youth unemployment, student loans, inflated property prices, devalued qualifications, unrealistic expectations and the government's incubation of a glut of graduates are inconveniences that can readily be surmounted. ""Provide emotional support,"" Denise counsels. But don't be ""too supportive – sometimes, it is really necessary to show tough love"". Thus, in a bold departure for the genre, the leaflet apportions blame at the same time that it advises: parents, not the government, are at fault when stubborn children persist in not working. ""If you are making life too comfortable at home,"" Denise bluntly states, ""why would they get a job?"" Given her specialism, as a careers coach, it is not always clear where Denise acquired her emotional authority. Maybe she has applied tough love at home? Although no children are mentioned in an exhaustive personal website, this need not mean she has no relevant experience. It might tells us the opposite: that Denise evicted her workshy dependants as soon as they could crawl. Or that given the trouble, expense and inconvenience represented by the average child, she opted not to have any of the skiving little monkeys in the first place. Where professional experience is concerned, Denise is on firmer ground. In a case study about ""Charlotte"", for instance, she explains the importance, if you want to find a job, of knowing the right people. ""Charlotte's father happened to mention Charlotte's situation to a fellow colleague who noted that his wife was currently working in PR,"" says Denise, showing how it's done. ""One year on and she hasn't looked back."" As for practical guidance, our expert keeps it basic. ""Produce a great covering letter,"" she tells graduates, without, alas, supplying a template. (Though there is a link to her own website.) ""You may be googled,"" she reminds them, ""so what will be found?"" Sensible advice, no doubt, for any reader still unaware what Gordon Brown's YouTube appearances have done to his reputation. In Diane's case, a quick google brings up diaries of her exotic holidays (""I am getting fed up with Indian food"") that may, possibly, be less damaging than the evidence, given the job-seeking services she markets online, that readers of ""Parent Motivators"" are being palmed off with insulting drivel. ""Yes,"" says Denise, ""some people will make it as actors and film script writers but many just waste away the years."" Top Tip: governments – save on costly advisers by getting unemployed graduates to write your leaflets. No one will spot the difference and if you call it an internship you won't have to pay them anything at all.",Do we really need advice on how to deal with boomerang kids? | Catherine Bennett,2010-01-03T00:06:05Z,Catherine Bennett,politics
"On the imaginary Baader-Meinhof clock of insurrection, it is one minute before midnight in Britain. But what will happen next? In countries such as France, Russia and America, where the clock had once struck 12 and the workers decided enough was enough, revolutions followed. All we've had in Britain are a peasants' revolt and a couple of riots when the Chartists were disobedient. On continental Europe and in the Americas, they brought down the aristocracy with guns and axes, then strung them up from trees and lamp-posts. In Britain, we shout: ""What do we want? A minute of your time, if it's not too much trouble. When do we want it? At your earliest convenience and begging your pardon."" For we have too much respect for our democratic institutions and for our beloved monarch to entertain any notions of dull violence and chaotic rebellion when the blood is up. We would all surely regret it in the morning. And it is such rectitude and fortitude in the face of adversity which have given our country its stability and guardsman's bearing that is the envy of the world. This is what we tell ourselves when we have just received another slap from our elected representatives at Parliament and their cohorts in the corporate and financial charnel houses of HBOS and Globespan. Except this year, the slaps came hard and fast. You wonder if a little period of instability would be a price worth paying to hand out a lesson they would never forget to the thieves and profligates in our banking and political edifices who have grown fat on our honesty and trust. It was the year when corporate and political Britain finally revealed its contempt for those from whose labours it has profited. The full extent of our MPs' greed was revealed just at that time when we first began to understand that Sir Fred Goodwin and his avaricious brotherhood had been playing Russian roulette with the nation's economy. Yet it wasn't simply the fact of these follies that revealed them in all their vainglorious idiocy. If the politicians would just pay back the money they owed us without any fuss and a few of the most covetous fell on their swords, then we would forgive them and hand them a written warning at the next election. Better still, they could make amends by stripping the bankers of their bonuses and their Learjets and forcing them henceforth to undergo much more stringent scrutiny of their activities. Yet following the initial obsequious outpourings of remorse from politicians, they began to reveal their true colours. They back-pedalled when many realised they probably did not have the funds to make good their promises of repayment. What we were demanding of them was too, too draconian. Meanwhile, directors of the Royal Bank of Scotland, having helped bring the economy to its knees, effectively attempted to hold the country to ransom: if you don't allow us to continue paying obscene bonuses to our star players, then we shall all resign, they said. They even tried to admonish us for having the cheek to ask for rigour and discipline in their bonus structures. How can we compete with the galacticos of world banking, they whined, if you don't allow us to pay them properly? They were asking us to believe that there is some enchanted golden mean in global finance, the knowledge of which is only granted to a chosen few mystics and necromancers. They alone have the power to heal our broken economies and we, the idiot punters, would do well not to interfere. Yet Britain has thousands of successful entrepreneurs whose hard work and adroit and proportionate investment has built businesses and provided employment. Many of them would beg to disagree with the RBS's lofty opinion of its structures and governances. But they hadn't finished abusing us yet. For in November the new Supreme Court, administering justice in our name, allowed seven of our major banking institutions to continue robbing the accounts of hundreds of thousands of UK citizens. In justifying their wildly disproportionate overdraft charges, the banks lectured us on good financial housekeeping, diligence and discipline in our personal finances. This, from a worthless cartel whhich had just destroyed the economy because they couldn't stop themselves even when the bells were ringing at the level crossing and the lights were flashing. They had shown all the restraint of a Mississippi riverboat gambler putting his house on black with an empty bottle of Jack Daniel's at his side. And still we merely shrugged and told ourselves there was little to be done amid the usual sporadic outbreaks of fist-waving. In the last few days, our people have been left high and dry on some foreign peninsula by an airline's sudden collapse. Many more of them have been treated like dogs because a train system costing billions couldn't cope with the wrong type of snow and the operators couldn't communicate with each other properly. These are a sick metaphor for the current relationship between rich and corporate Britain and those who have granted them their power. Next year, we have been warned to expect public spending cuts at levels not seen since the end of the war. Who is there to marshal our anger and to channel it in ways that will make the directors of UK plc pay heed? If such a person exists, he is not currently to be found in Westminster.","If I wasn't so polite, I'd have manned the barricades | Kevin McKenna",2009-12-27T00:05:04Z,Kevin McKenna,politics
"So what happened? Did Rage Against the Machine rage against music mogul Simon Cowell successfully – did they manage to topple Joe McElderry's The Climb, making their own track, Killing in The Name, the first non-X Factor Christmas number one in five years? Whatever the outcome, what point were they and the online campaign trying to make and why didn't they make it better? Let's be clear: whatever happens today, it hasn't lost Cowell money – RATM just ensured him heaps of publicity, and an Oasis/Blur-style face-off, resulting in huge sales for both acts. Well, you might say, it still gave Cowell and Sony bloody noses. Nope. ""Anti-capitalists"" RATM are also with Sony, so at least one record company will be having the best Christmas ever. You really stuck it to the machine there, didn't you, Rage? Admittedly, Rage's is the better track, with that wonderful refrain: ""Fuck you, I won't do what you tell me"". It's a shame for McElderry that, first, X Factor lumbered him with a dreadful song, first caterwauled by Miley Cyrus, sounding as though her dad was kicking her with his heaviest cowboy boots on. And, second, he's a perma-smiley white boy from South Shields. Rage would never have got anywhere with last year's Hallelujah. More to the point – Alexandra Burke being sassy and black, with a mother with a Soul II Soul pedigree – they probably wouldn't have dared to try. Indeed, for this campaign, Joe McElderry couldn't have been an easier-to-shoot fish in a barrel. That's why, when Cowell says that he considers the campaign ""snobbery"" and ""bullying"", I agree with him. This is not to say that Cowell isn't being ridiculous, accusing BBC airplay of bias because X Factor trounced Strictly in the ratings. And why should X Factor always get to Christmas number one? Indeed, the Rage thing would be funny if it were meant as a prank, a Jarvis Cocker/Jacko Brits moment, to get on Cowell's nerves. Instead, it's all holier than thou, Rage's Tom Morello saying how it's about ""saving the UK pop charts from this abyss of blank mediocrity"", ""what you're seeing is real democracy"" and agonising over ""what saccharine pop music does to the nation's souls"". Wow, man, deep. Or it would have been if Rage's song hadn't first been released in 1992. Note to Mr Morello: if you're trying to make a point about ""the cutting edge"", instead of using a song that is nearly 20 years old, perhaps you should get off your backside and produce something that is – what's the word again – oh, yes, new. As for striking a blow against the dominance of commercialism: how pompous. Everyone knows that X Factor is for kids, grans and mildly sozzled parents with no social lives (""Hi!"") and what's so wrong with that? Aren't audiences allowed to enjoy a weekend family entertainment show and its spin-offs? Is ""Buy our record, not his, nerrr"" what passes for ""real democracy""? To my mind, Rage and their cronies aren't doing this for the people, they are sneering at the taste of the people. Indeed, it says something, that, while those who like X Factor mainly think it's a laugh, it's the people who hate X Factor – the middle class, the petty – who take it too seriously and end up dictating to others what they should be watching, liking, hearing, and buying. In truth, McElderry, like the majority of X Factor alumni (JLS, Burke, Leona), ticks the boxes better than most ""street"" musos anyway – working class, talented, hungry; who says he doesn't deserve his shot? Especially when the other side is guilty of far worse: laziness, snobbery and choosing shamefully easy targets. You want me to buy into that? Well, to borrow a phrase, fuck you, I won't do what you tell me. The BBC set a brutal question, but the story is uglier One could only feel mystified by the furore over the BBC news website allowing the debate ""Should homosexuals face execution?"" (changed later to ""Should Uganda debate gay execution?""). The issue was raised, prior to a discussion for World Service African listeners, relating to the anti-homosexual bill proposed in Uganda, which, if passed, could mean the death penalty for any homosexual who is HIV positive and has sex and life imprisonment for anyone convicted of the ""offence"" of homosexuality. This same bill has been at the centre of controversy for two weeks and is presumably of vast interest to all of us, gay or straight, all over the world. Why then did so many people react as though BBC heads had just slurped down a latte and cried: ""Hey, let's just randomly ask if gays should be killed – that would be a jolly festive wheeze""? Not only was the BBC absolutely right to highlight this debate, it would have been ethically wrong for it not to. Would we prefer countries such as Uganda to be able quietly to push through these bills? Was it not a good thing that gay men and women in Africa were given an all-too unusual opportunity to air their views? There seemed to be plenty of British voices, too, with some 400 contributions being deemed too unpleasant to be shown, though one man managed a rant about having to ""suffer gay pride festivals"" and expressed his view that all homosexuals should be marooned on an island to die out. It makes you wonder what the deleted ones said. Just as wearying were the well-meaning, liberal hand-twisters, squealing about how the BBC debate was ""sick"", ""unnecessary"" and how upset they were. Liliane Landor, acting head of the Africa region for the World Service, responded that a stark approach was required to reflect the stark reality of the bill and she was right. However jarring these debates are, they need to happen, in the case of gay Africans, as loudly as possible, for they have no voice. People seem worried that even airing ugly ideas lends them legitimacy but, happily, the BNP's Nick Griffin proved otherwise on Question Time. So yes, an unpleasant question, but perhaps we should be on our guard that squeamishness does not become a western luxury that others, less fortunate, end up paying for. Pam's a pantomime villain! Oh no she isn't! Talk about putting the Prince Charming boot in. All week, people have been mocking Pamela Anderson for appearing as the genie in Aladdin in Wimbledon, harping on about her too-sexy outfits, giant plastic boobs (""In front of you!"") and all-round tackiness. How dare Pammie lower the tone, British pantos being such beacons of sophistication and erudition? One doubts that it is Anderson's fault her role is so sexed up. I suffered through last year's Cinderella in Wimbledon and the innuendos came thick and fast, despite starring Gareth Gates, a performer with all the sexual charisma of a boiled egg. Maybe the barrage of insults against Anderson just proves that panto is bad for women, from the creepy guys running around in bad drag to the ""pure"", innocent heroine, usually some TV blonde, who would much rather be selling her soul advertising Timotei. None of which is particularly bothersome; panto is just one of those slightly tragic British throwbacks that have somehow survived, like cheese rolling or Boris Johnson. Nor am I under the illusion that Pam is treading the Wimbledon boards for anything other than the only sane reason anyone would – money. However, with all this pantomime lunacy having gone on in Britain since the 18th century, it seems more than a bit rich to be lambasting Ms Anderson for lowering standards. Considering that, before this, Anderson was probably unaware of British panto mores, apologising might be more appropriate. • A New Zealand church has caused outrage by erecting a billboard depicting a sombre Mary and Joseph, naked between the sheets, with the words: ""Poor Joseph – God was a hard act to follow."" The church says it was meant as a challenge to liberal interpretations of the Bible, but what's the fuss about?

"It is every cricketer's worst nightmare. A treasured bat lies in three pieces, smashed by the skull of an intruder whom you have just chased down the street and attacked. Why didn't you use a golf club? Or at least decide to stop hitting the criminal at the point where he was incapacitated, but the bat had yet to sustain irreparable damage? For Munir Hussain, of High Wycombe, there is the additional annoyance that the attack with a cricket bat left his victim, Walid Salem, with fractures of the skull, causing brain damage. Now, as well as the loss of vital sporting equipment, he has to accept that the permanent injuries which he himself inflicted will deny him the satisfaction of seeing his enemy jailed. Finding Hussain guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, the judge said: ""It is somewhat ironic that by reason of the head injuries inflicted upon him he [Walid Salem] was unfit to plead and could not be sentenced to the very long period of imprisonment which would otherwise have been imposed upon him."" Instead, as was widely reported last week, it was the respectable, rich and formerly law-abiding Mr Hussain and his brother, Tokeer, who both received prison sentences, for 30 and 39 months respectively. Summing up, the judge prophesied that these sentences, lenient in the light of the extreme provocation endured, would yet prove controversial. ""It may be that some members of the public or media commentators will assert that the man Salem deserved what happened to him at the hands of you and the two others involved,"" the judge told the Hussains, ""and that you should not have been prosecuted and need not be punished."" Second only to being targeted as a social menace by the Daily Mail's Paul Dacre, the Hussain trial must be every judge's worst nightmare. However carefully you summarise the case for conviction, pointing out that the antagonist does not even claim to have acted in self-defence, that the attack took place some distance from his house and family, and that a witness who saw the assault – of a man who was running away – likened it to the action of a ""pack of animals"", you know that it will make no difference. None of these details will be allowed to weaken the desired narrative: innocent householder jailed, offending scum set free, case for vigilantism resoundingly confirmed. For many commentators, Mr Hussain's status as a wealthy and devout family man, who was just back from his prayers when his family was subjected to a terrifying assault, appears to make him a lot more appealing than the solitary, tormented farmer, Tony Martin. Now free, after serving three years for killing a burglar, the farmer has endorsed the BNP, which, in turn, promised a ""Tony Martin law"" allowing homeowners to defend their property against criminals. Perhaps the obvious difficulty that the BNP might face in championing the actions of Mr Hussain helps explain why both commentators and bloggers, on the left as well as the right, have been so eager to gloss over the more disturbing aspects of his heroics. That Mr Hussain was unable to explain how a carful of supporters, none of whom had personally been threatened by Salem, should suddenly have materialised to assist with the reprisal, has barely given pause. Instead, Hussain's vigorous and effective application of old-fashioned retribution, to a point where he may easily have killed his enemy, has been widely cheered as a beacon of justice in a land where faith in law enforcement has all but broken down. Supporters, in their hundreds, have agreed with commentators who say Hussain's experience was ""every father/man's worst nightmare"". Thus, once his woman and children had been threatened, he was entitled to take whatever form of vengeance he chose, outside the family property as well as on it. If women have been slower to exclaim: ""I'd have done exactly the same"", it is maybe that, lacking the sporting equipment or a man able to use it, fewer of us are in a position to try. Though I suppose something might be done with a tightly rolled yoga mat or, for the lucky ones, a gun. In their absence, male bloggers have shown a rhetorical machismo that makes Hemingway look like a girl. Given a chance, assert these warriors, they would personally kill any scrote, toerag, scumbag or piece of human filth that dared to mess with their families. They shower praise on Hussain, propose that he be given a medal, adduce his feats as an argument for guns and as evidence of contemptible police failure. ""If the authorities are incapable of dealing with the human excrement like the type who attacked Mr Hussain,"" writes a typical sympathiser, ""then they deserve no mercy when the ordinary men and women of this country exact their own brand of justice on the scum that are ruining our lives."" Yet more provoking for the vigilante posse is that in this case a judge and jury appear to have taken it upon themselves to act as judge and jury. Hussain was not sentenced until 12 bona fide ordinary men and women, having heard the evidence, found him guilty. It is hard, once you have read anything about this case, to imagine how they could have done otherwise. Anyone who thinks Hussain should have been excused punishment is, as the judge suggested, endorsing a brutal free for all in which the rule of law counts for nothing. If, as may easily have happened, Salem had died in the revenge attack, Hussain's men would have administered the ultimate punishment on a charge of unlawful imprisonment (curiously, it was not clear that theft motivated the invasion). And even if one forgave Hussain's actions, given the provocation, how would this precedent serve those of us who, since we can't run down the street and half-kill our enemies, are forced to rely on conventional justice? Even though one can't be sure, given the stimulating influence of blogging anonymity, how many of Hussain's champions would really like to swap civilisation for the survival of the fittest, the expression, in hundreds of remarkably homogeneous posts, of a general rage against police uselessness, against lenient sentencing and a privileging of criminals' over victims' rights, is something that should interest David Cameron, if not the Home Office. More than a decade since the phrase ""tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime"" struck Brown and Blair as a phrase so politically powerful that the two men actually squabbled over it, quite disparate sections of the population are united by an alienation from the criminal justice system so extreme that they support violent freelance retribution. It's not necessarily confined to criminals. ""Does anyone have the judge's address?"" asks one amateur justice on the Telegraph's website. ""Maybe a home invasion of his premises might bring him to his senses."" Let us hope his honour is handy with a bat.",What sort of society praises vigilantes with cricket bats? | Catherine Bennett,2009-12-20T00:05:35Z,Catherine Bennett,uk
"The scaffolding has cleared from the most astonishing man-made structure I have seen. It is outrageous, wasteful, egotistical, ridiculous; but ask if the Burj Dubai is beautiful and I cannot deny it. When it formally opens (mostly empty) early next year, this Dubai tower will, at 818 metres, be the highest building anywhere, its ""sneer of cold command"" thrusting a finger at the outside world even as its Ozymandian surroundings sink beneath the economic waters of the Gulf. With the Dubai property market plummeting, the Burj is the final grandiose gesture of the emirate's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, on his long campaign to make Ludwig of Bavaria seem like a jobbing builder on the North Circular Road. Unlike most new skyscrapers, the $8bn (£5bn) Burj Dubai does not rise until the point where an accountant calculates the lifts can take no more. Its 20-acre base has the plan of a six-leaf desert flower, from which it launches itself into the sky in a diminishing cluster of rocket-like cylinders, spiralling and soaring to a celestial climax. This is no pastiche Mies, pastiche Corb, pastiche Foster, like the postmodern blobs, slices, wedges and cornets that crowd every Gulf skyline, screaming ""look-at-me"" at the brain-dulled passerby. Burj Dubai, designed by the Chicagoan architect, Adrian Smith of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill and closely watched by the sheikh himself, leads the eye ever upwards. It has the exhilaration of a Gothic spire. At the top, a spike rises further, swaying 1.5 metres in the wind and appearing to bend towards the viewer, as if appalled at its own presumption in puncturing the heavens. Dubai this week lay in the shadow of its new tower, a partygoer still dancing in the streets hours after the party has ended. Its hyperbolic malls are crowded, its freeways jammed and its latest attention-grabber, an international film festival, mobbed by crowds. On Monday Dubai's more sober neighbour, Abu Dhabi, tossed its defaulting property market a $10bn note for one last drink, with another $1bn in pocket money for the embarrassed Maktoum family. The sheikh's obedient media barely mentioned the humiliation, as a drunk cares not who pays for the last round. The construction sites, once host to a quarter of the world's cranes, are mostly still building, but no one holds out much hope for the sea-girt ocean palms and ""cities"" planned at the height of the most reckless property bubble in history. The chairman of Dubai World, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, might cry earlier this year, ""Dubai has a vision like no other place on earth,"" but it is a vision few want to share just now. A quarter of new residential units stand empty and 34,000 are still under construction. Nothing is heard now of a plan to build a tower higher even than Burj Dubai in the port area. An archipelago in the form of a map of the world remains as piles of sand offshore, crazily shipped like coals to Newcastle from Australia and rumoured to have disgorged antipodean snakes into the Gulf. The capital of irrational exuberance has embarked on an almighty hangover. Since I have long seen Dubai as a speculative accident waiting to happen, I could not resist a debate on its future, held on Monday in the rival statelet of Qatar up the coast – and held with not a little schadenfreude. Dubai's protestation of open markets, an open society and western freedoms have long been absurd. Its rulers reacted to the debate (broadcast next month by BBC World) by trying to have the Qataris suppress it and ensuring that three Dubai speakers and all Dubai journalists boycotted it. This was absurdly self-defeating, since a motion critical of Dubai's breakneck expansion was defeated 60-40. Twitter and Facebook were flooded with the good news for Dubai, in a week when there had been precious little. Yet none of this was allowed to be reported in Dubai's censored media. Never were so many well-groomed heads buried in so much desert sand. The surest sign of a polity that has lost confidence in itself is when its rulers cannot tolerate a debate on its affairs. Even the word default has had to be replaced in the Dubai press by ""debt restructuring"" or ""new legal framework"". Outsiders are routinely blamed for the property market collapse, which the emirate's buccaneers and paid stooges have for years been stoking with hyperbole. Property values are reported to be 50% down from their peak and are predicted by UBS analysts to be heading for 75%. Those who mimicked the 17th-century Dutch who believed that tulip prices could never fall are left with the paranoid's last gasp, blaming foreigners for their woes. The most mesmerising thing about Dubai is not its present but its future. Will it be Machu Picchu, Angkor Wat or Fatehpur Sikri? Will it become a place of sand and weeds, so many ""trunkless legs of stone"" lost on a scorching Gulf shore? What will happen when the world's funny money starts to flow elsewhere? What happens when a future sheikh goes either environmental or religious and tires of boosterism, returning to tents and camels, to order and respect for his ancestors? What happens when some political whirlwind sweeps across the Gulf from Iran, or down from Iraq, or across from Saudi Arabia? At a certain point in the decline in property values, it no longer pays owners to maintain lifts, services and utilities (as on a British tower estate). More likely Dubai will be a desert Detroit, a place of widespread dereliction with some money remaining at the centre but with ghost towns and squatted housing in the sweltering suburbs. The smart money is already on the more cautiously developed Qatar and Abu Dhabi stealing its financial thunder and leaving Dubai with its bizarre hotels: Las Vegas to Los Angeles, or Atlantic City to New York. There is a touch of Vegas to the gold-plated atrium of the ""seven star"" Burj Al-Arab hotel, with its casino baroque and computerised fountains like leaping dolphins. There is more than a touch of Disney to the $1.5bn Atlantis hotel, opened this year by Kylie Minogue, with shark-filled aquarium wall, garden gnome interior and giant conches for capitals. Already the office towers of Dubai look like those of a pre-cyber age, when the rich had to live near the oil, and celebrities could be induced to buy off-plan and sell before the fireworks ended. Why live in Dubai and shop at an ersatz Harvey Nichols when you can live in Knightsbridge and shop at the real one? Dubai is a gaseous burp about to explode in the desert air. But when it explodes it will leave behind the sensational Burj, standing visible across the desert, gleaming proudly in the sun. One day the cost of keeping it up will exceed its income, its steel will rot and the swaying summit will become dangerous. The mother of all demolitions will have to begin. Then Shelley can have his moment and Ozymandias his epitaph. But for the time being Dubai can at least boast a true wonder of the world.","When this gaseous burp explodes in the desert air, we'll still have the Burj Dubai | Simon Jenkins",2009-12-17T21:00:01Z,Simon Jenkins,world
"It is quite an achievement to set out a painful plan to reduce Britain's budget deficit by £100bn over four years, the deepest and fastest proportional cut since the Second World War, and be accused of timidity, dithering and buck-passing. But that was the reaction to Alistair Darling's pre-budget report last week, which, apart from the eye-catching and popular tax on bank bonuses, provided a textbook example of how to fall between two stools. Mr Darling, predictably, could not please the economic conservatives who are prepared to risk prolonged economic stagnation with even faster and deeper cuts that could endanger social stability and even the integrity of the state. But neither did he win enough credit for a number of measures – offering a job guarantee to all 18- to 24-year-olds who have been out of work for six months, a new low 10% tax on the profits from new patents and a £500m fund to support the financing of fast-growing small companies – that were progressive and will move the country on, even as he halves the budget deficit. They were drowned out by the condemnation that he was a ditherer who had been rolled over by a prime minister who still cannot accept the profundity of what has happened and wants to rerun a general election on a dividing line of Tory cuts against Labour investment. This is the heart of Labour's problem. It is not the content of policy, which is intelligent, in the right direction and copied by other countries – witness France and Germany's reaction to the tax on bank bonuses despite the outcry from the City. Nor would an incoming Tory government materially change the framework. No, the problem is rather that it is impossible to shape a convincing political narrative from the content unless the starting point is an honest recognition that the country is in a profound crisis created by previous policy mistakes. No government led by Gordon Brown can do that because the incontestable truth is that Mr Brown's misjudgments are one of the chief reasons that the crisis is now so deep. Mr Brown plainly feels he can't acknowledge this truth, doesn't believe it or feels that even if there were previous mistakes, he is doing the right things now. Whatever the explanation, he disarms every senior minister and neuters his government. The Conservatives will not let the government off the hook. The only issue is how effective they will be and shadow chancellor George Osborne's sharp and confident performance in the House of Commons showed that Labour hopes that ""Boy George"" is the Tories' weak link are seriously awry. Osborne will press home that the structural budget deficit is now shockingly high because Brown as chancellor spent too much and hugely overestimated future tax revenues, believing his own propaganda that he had eliminated boom and bust and created a wonder economy. Osborne has a point, a great support for any politician's self-confidence. Britain entered its deepest postwar recession with a structural deficit of between £40bn and £50bn. Brown had made sure in the 1997-2001 and 2001-2005 parliaments that he tightened policy at the beginning so that he could relax at the end in the run-up to the 2001 and 2005 general elections. But in 2003, he began loosening policy, trading on his reputation for prudence, and continued right up to the moment he became prime minister; there were no vitally necessary tax increases or spending reductions after May 2005 – nothing was to obstruct his route to the top. Surprisingly, the Tories have yet to say that his personal desire to mount a coup against a sitting prime minister is one of the reasons the country now faces such tough options. Historians will not be so generous. On top, Mr Brown – and Mr Balls – can not escape responsibility for the regulatory regime that allowed British banks to grow so rapidly underpinned by so little capital, which generated both the credit and property booms and the toxic bonus culture. They designed it. They were both uncritically pro-City. Yes, there were achievements to offset the mistakes. There has been a huge investment in the science base and the first foundations laid of a national innovation system – yet to be described in those terms – which business secretary Lord Mandelson has further developed. And when the crisis broke, the government was right to allow public borrowing to take the strain of averting a slump. But the good is submerged by the reality of the earlier mistakes and the rhetoric of obeisance to wealth-creating bankers that accompanied it. This is fatally disabling. The government needs to say that we are in an unprecedented economic emergency which can be resolved only if everyone responds creatively and urgently and accepts their mistakes, City and government alike. It needs to spell out that although it believes in an activist approach to public spending and borrowing and that a growing national debt in these circumstances is nothing to be frightened about, everybody has to tighten their belts and contribute, because the situation has to be brought under control. Britain thought it could build an economic future with financial services as the flagship. It could not. We have to create a wider economic base with innovation at its heart, hence the moves in the pre-budget report, which, for all their merit, should have been much more radical, determined and convincing. Get the new emphasis right and the economic recovery going and the first quarter of the £100bn deficit reduction can be delivered from economic growth. Next it has to be honest. Some £75bn of reduction over four years will remain. A third of this reduction can rightly be delivered by hikes in tax rates – yes, tax hikes – which is what the government has cumulatively announced in restoring the VAT cut, raising the top income tax rate to 50%, removing the rich's tax breaks on pensions and lifting national insurance contributions. Everyone has to play their part, even the sacred City. There may be more to come because tax revenues are proportionally the lowest since 1960. Say so. The rest has to come from cutting spending. The public sector needs to get more from less in a way that it has not considered ever in peacetime. There will have to be cuts in real wages and dramatic increases in efficiency if frontline services are to be preserved. Nothing should be ringfenced, although some services are plainly more important than others. Spell out what is going to have to stop or where invention is needed. Britain may have to ask up to 20 of its new universities to become colleges again. To run a navy without aircraft carriers. Roll back its cherished overseas aid budget. Phase in the age when pensions kick in. Everything should be on the table and the challenge the government has accepted should be spelled out. It is because the government pretends that its plans do not involve pain that Richard Lambert at the CBI and the governor of the Bank of England impatiently call for more. Both are sane men, but more would take the state and social cohesion to the very edge. Yet they help create a climate in which very tough measures are seen as dithering. For Labour, the implication is inescapable. It has to reframe what it is doing –and fast. There is no time to waste.",Darling's plan was more radical than he got credit for.

"One of the most interesting facets of any government move to curb excessive national drinking (this time the House of Commons health select committee's proposed call for a minimum price on alcohol) are the photos that accompany the reports. These mainly comprise drunken young women in miniskirts, staggering along provincial high streets, with a bottle in their handbags, and their knickers hanging off one ankle, or rolling about in gutters, covered in Malibu vomit. Coming up close behind (so to speak) are drunken young men, another of whom was caught urinating on a war memorial last week. Perhaps you have to do something as heinous as urinating on a war memorial to compete with the rowdy, knicker-flashing girls these days. Ultimately, however, it's confusing: are the young, the dumb and the pretty really the only ones drinking to excess in Britain today? Taking genuine alcoholism out of the equation, there is something just a bit pious and annoying about the new national blood sport of whining incessantly about people drinking. Yes, it is disappointing that 24-hour licensing did not result in a Parisian-style cafe culture, but anyone with an IQ higher than their shoe size saw that one coming, so perhaps it's time to stop faking all this shock horror. Likewise, there's something weary-making about these proposals to increase alcohol prices, this time, to a minimum of 50p a unit, to deter binge drinking, make drink less accessible to those on low incomes and reduce drink-related injuries and deaths. For one thing, it is too reminiscent of the smoking ban in pubs. So now a lot of people smoke at home. Sometimes inside. With children sleeping upstairs. Also, are we forgetting all those reports on the middle classes, who don't realise their nightly tipple of wine club vino has got stronger, and their glasses bigger, meaning that many are inadvertently, blood millilitre for blood millilitre, just as perma-sloshed as those who grab budget six-packs from the supermarket shelves? This seems to be the problem with the proposals. They miss their real targets – the hardened regular drinkers. In real terms, putting up the price of alcohol is unlikely to deter them because they are (hello!) hardened regular drinkers. Just as the smoking ban mainly encouraged moderate smokers to give up, hardened drinkers wouldn't stop buying pricier alcohol; they (and therefore their families) would just have less money for everything else. Price hikes would chiefly affect moderate drinkers, who were not the problem in the first place. The fatal flaw lies in the framing. Sometimes, it seems that the people behind these proposals have bought into the media myth of our national drinking problem mainly comprising sexy, dishevelled, young things lying pissed in gutters in Nottingham on a Saturday night, that it really is just a matter of making WKDs too expensive for them. In truth, there are many types of drinker out there, a lot of them older, educated or just entrenched in their habits. What is going to be done about them? It seems to me that no matter how hard the modern-day temperance movement bangs its campaigning tambourines for higher alcohol prices, these people are unlikely to curb their drinking. Maybe this is why these kinds of proposals prefer to deal in obvious targets and cliches (the WKD-downing fillies; the tattooed ""rent-a-chavs"" pushing trolleys full of Tennent's Super) rather than the multi-faceted reality of heavy, regular drinking, which transcends age, class and gender. For this reason, I have long thought that it would make a nice change, if, just for once, the set of photos illustrating an ""excessive alcohol"" article could be a couple in matching Boden jumpers, sitting with their third large glass of burgundy, watching a Cranford repeat. Who wouldn't say ""Cheers!"" to that? Mr Squiggles is safe, but, golly, it was a narrow squeak Mr Squiggles is innocent. For the benefit of those without primary-aged children, Mr Squiggles is one of the Go Go Hamsters, battery-operated rodents and ""the hot Christmas toy of 2009"". Or they were hot until they were accused by an unofficial testing company of having fur containing a trace of an arsenic-like substance. Next, the testers admitted that they hadn't used properly regulated testing methods, while the UK distributor of Go Gos, Character Options, retested the toys, reasserted they were safe, and began to make not hamster sounds but suing noises. I think they should go go for it. Admittedly, this had its funny side. All those smug parents who thought they'd aced it suddenly came over all queasy and reached for the Argos catalogue. Yes, that does include me. Certainly now that the Go Gos have been shown to be safe, my team of crack investigators (child's gran reading the tabloids; myself firing off ""Concerned of Wimbledon"" emails to Character Options) feels we have a happy ending. However, there was something a little malevolent about this. Never mind that there is often scaremongering about hot Christmas toys. Was this fair on Character Options, a small firm based in Oldham? Moreover, this was mean-spirited. Typically, fashionable toys are prohibitively expensive (Wii, for instance). Although Go Gos eventually went for silly money, they started off at about £10, thereby making them within the means of all families, whatever their pocket. The first truly democratic hot Christmas toy for ages and they had to go and ruin it. Never mind, Mr Squiggles, we believed in your innocence all along. Why does Hollywood lecture me, not entertain me, now? In one special way, society should feel grateful to James Cameron, director of Titanic, and the newly released, much-hyped Avatar. Whatever else might be said about him, no other film director has done more to try to drown Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio. A whopping 12 years later, Cameron resurfaces with Avatar and what is known in the biz as a ""powerful message"". Moreover, people are heralding Avatar as an important face-off between commercial and artistic cinema. It doesn't seem to matter that Avatar is the most expensive film of all time ($500m, by some accounts), while some advance rumours from the US came to the conclusion that, to use a technical phrase: ""It blows."" To all such criticism, Cameron strikes a macho pose, probably a bit like Russell Crowe when he bravely threw that phone at the hotel minion. Cameron appears to think that we should be grateful he deigned to make his 3D movie about far-off planets and blue humanoids set in 2154. Not least because, to paraphrase his interviews, Avatar is highlighting the eco-destruction of Earth, the inevitability of Man's fall, not to mention the collective nature of human responsibility and… zzzzz. Sorry, I dozed off there and wouldn't most people? I don't remember George Lucas making such an almighty fuss when Star Wars came out. Could you imagine anyone from theatre, opera or the music, literary and art worlds even trying to get away with explaining what they did in such a pompous, droning, self-aggrandising way? They would be pelted with rotten tomatoes and forced to walk around wearing a sandwich board reading: ""Please don't feed the luvvie."" Yet somehow it's fine for Cameron to ramble on about his film, about, erm, 3D alien thingies, as if he's just rewritten Ulysses with one hand and War and Peace with the other, while feeding the starving with his toes. Frankly, from the sound of Avatar, I'd rather spend 150 minutes being waterboarded, but that's not the point. Time was when one accepted without question that there were few things more boring than someone waffling pretentiously about highbrow art. Maybe we'll have to revise that line – James Cameron proves that someone waffling pretentiously about low to middlebrow art can be just as paralysing. • Terry Wogan's leaving-do at the BBC.

"It may not be a very scholarly term, but for think tank fashion and versatility, you can't beat the word brittle. A few months ago, in a report called ""Resilient nation"", Demos proclaimed that ""British society is increasingly brittle"". That kind of brittleness originated in things such as unpredictable food supply and sewerage systems and in pretty much anything else that looked dodgy: ""The environment itself is becoming more brittle."" And so, it appears, are all of us. Last week, the Young Foundation scattered the word throughout a new report. ""Too many parts of British society are brittle, vulnerable to shocks, stressed… and in some cases close to the edge,"" the authors began, in this 250-page addition to the literature on wellbeing. By the end of the report, you gathered that the whole country is afflicted with galloping osteoporosis. ""Britain is a brittle society, with many fractures and many people left behind,"" it says. Their bad personal experiences are ""often connected to having small or brittle networks of social support"". You could understand the temptation. Where ""broken"" sounds too hysterical – and has in any case been contaminated by David Cameron – and ""frangible"" won't alliterate, ""brittle"" conveys the right impression of debility along with the suggestion that, with some decent care, British society might regain its toughness. Or as Geoff Mulgan, the director of the Young Foundation, put it in a summary of the findings, people could learn to ""bounce back"" from their setbacks. Resilience, his report says, can be taught to those without the resources to generate their own and it should be: ""To the public, it is obvious that psychological needs are as important as material ones, that love, care, peace of mind are as vital to a good life as having enough heating or enough clothes to wear."" But is it equally obvious that it is the state's business to meet those psychological needs as well? It is to the authors. Although they are to be congratulated for not proposing, as some have done, that our government emulate Bhutan's ""gross national happiness"" arrangements, the Young Foundation authors argue that prosaic forms of welfare support are no longer enough. ""In a society with relative material abundance,"" it says, ""the critical issues of welfare have become as much about psychology and relationships as material need."" Since no nice person would want to set their face against general wellbeing, the readiness of politicians of all sides to respond to such demands with happiness-building schemes should no doubt be considered enlightened, rather than creepy or simply credulous. David Cameron obliged some time ago with a plea for ""joy in people's hearts"" and improved ""GWB"" (general wellbeing). The government has announced happiness lessons for children and, last week, the arrival of New Horizons, a ""programme of action to help improve everyone's mental wellbeing"". ""This is about more than preventing mental illness,"" said Gordon Brown, that constant reminder that being prime minister doesn't bring you happiness. ""It is also about helping individuals and communities to bring the best out of themselves."" No doubt he is already complying with official advice for promoting the greatest mental wellbeing of the greatest number: ""This includes socialising regularly, exercising, enjoying nature and learning new things."" But what about people who like to sulk quietly at home? You wonder if he would not see a wider, much more immediate surge in collective pleasure by, say, placing the Blairs under house arrest or forcing the bankers who ruined us to undergo a form of painless but televised humiliation, maybe involving Ant, Dec and the private parts of a dead kangaroo. Though I learn from Wikipedia that John Stuart Mill took a dim view of schadenfreude, however many people got the happiness benefit. Brown's timidity has also been noted by the happiness community. After the publication of New Horizons, Dr Lynne Friedli, author of the World Health Organisation's influential report ""Mental health, resilience, and inequalities"", told the BBC that, if the government were serious about mental health, ""we have to tackle injustice"". Like many of her colleagues in wellbeing, she believes that the increases in inequality are connected to parallel increases in the incidence of mental illness. ""We have to face up to the fact that individual and collective mental health and wellbeing depend on reducing the gap between rich and poor,"" she said, on the publication of her report. But what seems so obvious and so desirable to specialists, such as Dr Friedli, will have to convince the public – many of whom probably feel quite happy with current levels of brittleness, inequality and mental ill-health. Even if you share, as I do, their aversion to gross inequality, it's possible to find the confidence of these happiness engineers almost surreal. Friedli describes the case for therapeutic social justice as ""overwhelming"". But isn't human behaviour – in all its perversity, greed and irrationality – more complicated than this? Critics of happiness advocates routinely stress the problems of measuring wellbeing, the lack of reliable data and report yet more difficulties when it comes to correlating crude, subjectively reported findings with fluctuating economic inequality (of which the extent is, in itself, disputed). Happiness advocates who agree on the social origins of mental ill health may still disagree on the significance of other, misery-inducing factors, such as cruelty, boredom, ignorance. Lord Layard, for instance, has been attacked for advocating, as well as progressive taxation, a massive increase in cognitive behaviour therapy; practitioners of rival cures object that it is useless or a way of keeping unhappy people quiet. Layard is also, of course, a prominent admirer of Bhutanese ways, which include, as any gap year student will tell you, quaint sumptuary laws of a kind not seen in Britain since George II banned the kilt. Bhutan's were introduced in 1989. ""Bhutan seems much happier than countries that have a materialist rather than moral ethos,"" Layard told the Guardian last year. This endorsement, from the man synonymous with modern utilitarianism, can only add to doubts about a programme that presumes that something as private and elusive as individual happiness can be defined, designed and tax-adjusted for. ""Ask yourself whether you are happy,"" Mill wrote, ""and you cease to be so."" Even supposing they are much wiser than Mill, our happiness scientists could surely have done more, considering the scale of their planned experiments, to reassure the relevant laboratory animals that their schemes are not self-aggrandising exercises, based on hazy or disputed evidence, whose suspect nature is repeatedly betrayed by the terminology. ""Gross national happiness"", for God's sake. And as for ""brittle"": is that any more telling than Cameron's salesman-like ""broken""? And even if it were, would it compare, for national urgency, with ""illiterate"", ""unemployed"" or - even now – ""cold""?",It's absurd to think that you can measure happiness | Catherine Bennett,2009-12-13T00:06:06Z,Catherine Bennett,society
" Outside British Home Stores on a corner of Sauchiehall Street, the little match girl knelt. A ragged square of brown carpet was failing to protect her knees from the cracks in a wet pavement. Not a single entreaty would pass her lips, for she was a long way from home. Nor did she need any. Her face, burnished by a Mediterranean sun, asked for a little of my kindness more profoundly than mere words of supplication. And though she was kneeling, it was with a straight back, for was there not a hint of nobility there? Her eyes were as dark as two in the morning and they carried a reproach. Please do not judge me. Is that what she was saying? She was as vulnerable and helpless as an unborn child. In an instant, though, I decided I had nothing to spare her and I left her to the tender mercy of Glasgow's implacable December elements. The city was moody and looking for a square go. Another moment was all I required to restore my peace of mind, for I had judged her and found her to be an immigrant, probably. Didn't we have enough of our own poor mendicants to ignore? She probably had a drug habit too and was, very possibly, a prostitute. So it would have been irresponsible of me to feed such antisocial behaviour. And didn't I have an urgent appointment with a cigarette, a coffee and the back page of the Daily Record? Wouldn't she have been better off back home in Jibrovia? Didn't she know that there was a recession on? She haunted the remainder of the day and as the rain turned to sleet and another large Bacardi slid across the tongue, I wondered if she was still there, lighting matches to keep out the cold and seeing in them visions of a lit-up Christmas tree and the face of a person who loved her in a land where she was wanted. Perhaps a few coins from me  would have just made the difference. At our economically downturned dinner parties, we will counsel each other about coping with the school fees. We will wonder aloud if it must be the Costa del Sol instead of Florida or the Algarve. There will be shrill and hysterical reassurances that the value of our properties will never fall because won't people always want houses in neighbourhoods such as ours? And after we have laid waste to a few bottles of sancerre, someone from among we liberals and chatterers will soon give vent to the sentiment that dare not speak its name. ""You have to understand that I hate the BNP and all that they stand for, but let's face it, we're taking far too many immigrants. Even Polly Toynbee thinks it's out of control. They're even being allowed to sell the Big Issue."" We will look at each other and ask who's been reading the Spectator behind the garden shed again. Who can ever know if we are taking in more than our fair share of asylum seekers or if our defences are being breached by armies of illegal immigrants? A few thousand City spivs have caused more damage to the institutions and way of life in the UK than a few million immigrants ever could. Not many of us, though, will ever be forced to bear witness to the degradations that crease the faces of those women who beg and suffer on the streets of Glasgow. As yet, they have not asked for much more than an ounce of my Christian charity.",And all she wanted was a few coppers… | Kevin McKenna,2009-12-13T00:05:02Z,Kevin McKenna,uk
"Every morning Britain's museum curators go down on their knees and pray: ""Lord, save me from temptation. Let me not become a theme park."" None does. The Almighty is merciful. This week a new £30m museum – it is nothing less – opened within the Victoria and Albert in London to house a portion of its hoard of medieval and Renaissance objects. They glow, glitter, shimmer and dazzle, outshining such rivals as the Metropolitan in New York, the Cluny in Paris, the British Museum in Bloomsbury. From Leonardo's notebook to Donatello's crucifixion, from the boar hunt tapestry to Giambologna's Samson Slaying a Philistine, the V&A can lay claim to be the outstanding showcase of pre-modern European antiquities (pre-1600). In Britain's hour of fiscal darkness it shows that the nation can still put on a stunning show, and at less than the cost of one lane of an Olympic pool. The V&A's great central court is laid out as an Italian piazza, lined with statues and tombs, over which hovers a Renaissance screen from a Dutch cathedral. Beyond lies a cluster of Gothic effigies and altarpieces with, in the distance, the sanctuary of Florence's chapel of Santa Chiara. Flanking rooms drip with the riches of Europe, as if the curators of the V&A had been on a Napoleonic looting expedition. Stained glass torn from Low Country churches radiates with cleverly directed daylight. Florence is again denuded, this time of the Annunciation from the church of Santa Maria Maggiore. Fine-tooled suits of armour – described as ""a cross between a Savile Row suit and a sports car"" – jostle with a Tintoretto self-portrait, a Medici study, the Gloucester gold candlestick, the Becket casket and a Veit Stoss boxwood Virgin ""clothed with the sun"". The pages of Leonardo's notes, with translations of each page, can be turned by computer. Display cases are near invisible and works are at eye level, enabling the viewer to study the thread of a quilt or the glint of stained glass. It is admirably done. There is, of course, no hint of a theme or a park in sight. There is no setting, no medieval chamber, no Renaissance wall or ceiling, cloister or loggia. This is the ""new museum"" in all its splendour. The object is all. The dominant colour is white. Context is left to book-learning and a cultured imagination. To the casual observer there is little after the dark ages to indicate chronology or narrative, apart from occasional vague headings such as ""splendour and society"" or ""art and ideas"". No distinction is drawn between countries of origin, rather the stress is on the unity of European culture. The result can seem intellectually confusing, a jumble of imagery, half-Christian, half-classical in derivation, with no roots in time or place. The best response is to close down the brain and drift through a mist of antique loveliness. The obvious reservation was put to me by a German visitor, an art dealer, who was fuming with rage. It was all too clinical. ""Where is the atmosphere?"" he cried. ""Where is the sense of mystery of the middle ages? Why is everything of white stone? You could remove the objects and replace them with beds, and it would be a good hospital."" I restrained from the theme park response, and protested merely that the V&A was a museum, not a medieval church or renaissance palace. He said that was no excuse. The Cloisters in Manhattan had more soul. Historical works of art should be given some context and setting. Certainly the new galleries contrast with the British historical collection on the other side of the V&A. Here objects are displayed in semi-enclosed spaces, conveying something of the intimacy in which they were enjoyed. The atmosphere is interior, that of corridors, chambers and chancels. There is darkness and detachment from the world outside. To go from one side of the V&A to the other is thus an aesthetic shock – like passing from the classical side of Oxford's Ashmolean museum to its pristine new wing. There is no point in saying one is ""better"" than the other. The concept of a museum is artificial, with objects removed for purposes of study and display from their previous settings, and set on pedestals, literal and metaphorical. Fashion in museum presentation is always changing, and each era is different. I share my German acquaintance's view that the new V&A is glaringly modernist, more than honouring the curators' message that the middle ages were not just about dirt, death and plague. There is something absurd in Paul Pindar's wooden house front, torn from its Bishopsgate birthplace and fastened high and alone on a brick wall to form a Golgotha of gaunt, blackened timbers, stripped of meaning. If the V&A can dress its objects in glass panels, steel rails and computer screens, then why not the gothic chambers of Cluny or enfilades of the Louvre, where tapestries, corbels and sculptures sit more easily on the eye? Why not a note of music? I am sure the V&A regards this as theme-park talk. It suggests Ruskin's much-ridiculed nervousness that he might find Venice ""so beautiful and so strange as to forget the darker truths of its history and being"". Medieval beauty might indeed have been created amid violence and squalor, but how to convey this without lurching into ersatz Disneyland? Most of these works were owned by an ecclesiastical or political elite, but to enjoy them we need not invoke the Black Death or the massacre of St Bartholomew's Day. The historian Francis Haskell wrote of the danger of reading too much meaning into the ""deceptive evidence of art"". This risks demanding a certificate in art history as admission into this exhibition. A more constructive response is that a museum cannot do everything. It is just a museum, an aesthetic orphanage of things lost, looted, bought, restored, analysed and pushed on stage for all to see. It is not a lesson in history or geography. For those who prefer their relics of medieval and Renaissance Europe fixed in architectural time and place there is no lack of opportunity. For all the horrors which the 20th century inflicted on Europe's past, the continent remains the last on earth where respect is shown by authority for historic buildings, for extant reminders of the past. Many have been defaced. I still wince to see objects that have been wrenched from old churches and carted off to museums. Will Venice one day reclaim the Madonna della Misericordia, hacked from an oratory in the 19th century and hailed on its arrival at the V&A as ""a page torn from history""? But these things rarely happen today. The setting of medieval and renaissance Europe lives on in the cathedrals and churches of England, in the ancient cities of Italy, the walled towns of south-west France and the palaces of the Rhine and Danube. The V&A should supply a map showing where its exhibits can still be seen as once displayed. I regard this magnificent show as essentially a taster, an invitation to voyage back from object to origin, from esoteric South Kensington to places beyond its imprisoning walls, where Europe's culture roams free in ancient streets and buildings, in the wood, brick and stone of history.","In this mist of antique loveliness, the object is all.

"Barack Obama's announcement of an Afghan ""surge"" is his frantic bid to rescue what promises to be a stumbling re-election campaign that must start in 2011. It oozes with his desperation not to be in Afghanistan. The question is how best to disengage. As in Vietnam and as the Russians found, withdrawal tends to be possible here in Afghanistan only after the generals on the ground have been given a last chance to claim victory. The chance is generous. With 30,000 more troops at a staggering cost of $1m per soldier per year, Obama's generals are charged with giving the Taliban a ""knock-out"" blow sufficient to send them reeling back into the mountains. This is supposed to allow the Kabul government to establish its sovereignty over its nation or, more plausibly, at least to give Nato a breathing space to escape. This surge bears no relation to that in Iraq, except as an exit strategy. In Iraq it involved the intensive policing of the Baghdad suburbs plus the blatant recruitment of Saddam Hussein's old Sunni militias to keep the peace in their enclaves, despite the potential threat this posed to the al-Maliki government of Shias. It gave Baghdad's enclaves a measure of security and established a new, if tenuous, balance of power in the provinces. Above all, it took Iraq and its continued deaths and bombings out of the headlines. In Afghanistan the strategy advanced by General Stanley McChrystal is not new. It involves flooding the towns with soldiers and money and hoping the Taliban will go away for the time being. The conditionals of army retraining and corruption eradication mean nothing. Afghan history says that ""training"" an Afghan army to fight Pashtun insurgents is futile. Afghans fight only for their tribe and its land, which is why the Taliban manages to train a ferocious soldier in days, while Nato has failed in years. Equally futile is to make withdrawal dependent on ridding the Kabul government of corruption. These conditions are just a smokescreen behind which Nato hopes to retreat. There is no more talk of 20-30 years. Obama needs to be leaving in 18 months. If the Taliban commanders are wise, and they usually are in these matters, they will simply wait, controlling the country areas and killing Nato patrols with sufficient regularity to keep western public opinion demoralised. As the saying goes, Nato has the watches but the Taliban has the time. Obama himself – and those round him – clearly has no stomach for this fight, any more than does Gordon Brown or the European allies. Afghanistan was a punitive raid that turned into an occupation that was not just mishandled but ill-conceived from the start. The operation now commencing is exit with dignity. Dignity will be the hard part.",Obama has no stomach for this fight | Simon Jenkins,2009-12-02T11:00:03Z,Simon Jenkins,world
"It's a crude reaction but it's the first one I had on hearing that the Swiss had voted to ban the building of minarets on mosques – the same reaction I have to the increasingly-frequent stories like it: how would I feel if this were not about them, but us? How, in other words, would I react if this latest attack were not on Muslims but on Jews? It's crude because no two situations are ever exactly the same, and Muslims and Jews have different histories – in Switzerland and everywhere else. But it's useful, allowing the testing of any proposition against an almost instinctive yardstick of decency. So how would I react if the Swiss voted to restrict the way synagogues are built? With horror, of course. Indeed, the mere hint of such a proposal in the heart of Europe – given the blood-soaked history of the 20th century – would send a shudder down the collective spine. That reaction alone would tell me that, on this proposal, there was only one decent place to be – against it. Or take Jack Straw's campaign against the niqab in 2006. He and his supporters made what they hoped was a subtle, nuanced case against women wearing the full veil, but my first thought was much simpler. What if a government minister told ultra-orthodox Jewish men that, in their full beards, it was hard to tell them apart, or that he disliked the custom that commands ultra-orthodox Jewish women to cut off their hair, covering their heads with either a wig or a hat? No matter how subtle or nuanced his reasons, I would feel that this was, at best, an act of bullying directed at a vulnerable minority or, at worst, the first step towards something much more menacing. I'm clearly not the only who thinks this way, submitting proposed anti-Muslim actions to an informal ""Jewish test"". It seems the proponents of the minaret ban proceeded the same way. According to Tariq Ramadan, the initial target of the Union Démocratique du Centre (UDC) campaign was due to be the Islamic method of animal slaughter – until the UDC realised that Jews, who also rely on ritual slaughter to produce kosher food, would immediately feel threatened. So they moved onto minarets, apparently confident that they had found an issue with few Jewish resonances (synagogue buildings rarely have an impact on the skyline and are often pretty inconspicuous). Of course, not everyone who voted yes on the Swiss referendum was some Islamophobe or racist. Some, as Joan Smith argues, had wholly admirable secularist motives. Indeed Smith makes a strong case for holding a larger discussion about the role of religion in public life and expresses frustration that we cannot seem to have a mature conversation about, for example, which symbols belong in public and which don't. I would welcome that conversation. I think we should have it. But here's a suggestion. Let's make sure that, for once, it doesn't start with the Muslims. For example, here in Britain, we should have that debate about faith schools. But let's begin with a proposal to close down the 7000 Christian schools in the state sector – and then move onto the Muslim schools. Or do I sense that there will be rather fewer takers for that conversation? What passionate secularists and atheists need to understand is that what seems to outsiders like a religious affiliation is, for many millions, only partly about faith. It's often partly, even largely, about identity. How can I be so sure that's true of Muslims? Because I know it's true of Jews. Which leads me to guess that the minaret ban will have one consequence its advocates did not predict. I reckon there'll be rather more Swiss Muslims going to the mosque this week than there were last. That's how people react when they're threatened. Don't ask me how I know.",The Swiss ban makes me shudder | Jonathan Freedland,2009-12-01T13:30:00Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"When the feast of St Andrew comes tomorrow, it will carry with it a question that many Scots felt would never be asked of them by a government in their own lifetime. The government that wants to ask us, though, is not yet big enough to ensure that we be allowed to answer it: should the Scottish government negotiate a settlement with the government of the United Kingdom so that Scotland becomes an independent state? The question is contained in the minority SNP devolved administration's white paper on an independence referendum. Each of the three main unionist parties has vowed to ensure that you and I, the idiot punters, will never actually have to endure the stress of answering the question ourselves. Instead, they will selflessly bear the yoke of this onerous burden themselves and will vote down the bill, on our behalf, at Holyrood. All 78 of them. While doing so, they will wring their hands and entreat us to view as absurd the self-indulgence of asking the taxpayer to foot the £150,000 that it has cost to bring the bill to parliament in the first place. Yet what is truly absurd is to think that a nationalist administration wouldn't bring forward a bill like this at the earliest opportunity. It is difficult to comprehend the current position of Labour and the Scottish Liberal Democrats on the referendum issue. There has never been anything approaching a majority of Scottish voters desiring full autonomy within the UK and the two most recent opinion polls have borne this out. Indeed, the response of Wendy Alexander, Labour's last Scottish leader, to a referendum was ""bring it on!"". This was before she was brought low by a clerical error over party donations that would have caused nary a ripple in a Tory MP's duck pond if it had occurred but 12 months later. Alexander's simple reasoning was that a ""No"" vote would be the most likely outcome in a referendum, based on all available Scottish philology and that the question would never again arise in this political generation. Alex Salmond himself had said so. The Scottish Lib Dems require all their collective will each day simply to remind the rest of us that they still exist. Yet in the recent past they have performed all sorts of political contortions just to insinuate themselves into anything approaching government on either side of the border. This will give the SNP hope that this most unprincipled of political parties may yet be persuaded to come on board and launch the referendum. Yet it is difficult to see how Lib-Dem leader Tavish Scott could retain political credibility if suddenly he were to become susceptible to SNP overtures. His oft-stated position is that the Lib Dems are a unionist party and, as such, can have no truck even with the concept of a referendum on the issue. What makes the position of Labour and the Lib Dems even more illogical is that the expected Conservative UK election victory next year will bolster the cause of the SNP. Writing in the Scottish edition of the Times last week, David Cameron was convoluted and unconvincing when he tried to argue that a victory for his party at Westminster would not provide succour to an SNP government at Holyrood. Even in that political galaxy far, far away when Scotland returned Conservative MPs in their twos, Margaret Thatcher was quite happy to sacrifice them all on the back of the poll tax, knowing that it would matter not a jot in terms of her UK majority. When Cameron announces his first round of public spending cuts, every single SNP and Labour local authority will be shouting about the Tories having no mandate to do so in Scotland. Cameron, by then, will have forgotten once more that Scotland exists… until August comes and the grouse are on the moors. A vulpine grin will break out upon Salmond's face and he will rub his hands as he looks to an increased majority at Holyrood in 2011. By then, the refusal by the parties of the union even to countenance a referendum on devolution may be revealed to have been sheer political folly. That wonderful writer and historian, Allan Massie, a unionist to the wood of his silver-topped cane, stated in 2007 that far worse things could befall Scotland than to separate from the United Kingdom. It is difficult to disagree with him. The SNP's devolved government has enjoyed reasonable success, certainly no worse than the two previous Labour administrations. Our country remains affluent and there is still a desire to eradicate poverty and to achieve excellence in healthcare and education. Yet there are few, if any, separatists who can demonstrate how everyday life in Scotland will improve after independence in any specific area. And do not even mention the fatuous long-term reliance on the revenue from diminishing North Sea oil reserves. And why would anyone want to loosen our ties with a world-class country like England which has fought tyranny side by side with us and which continues to offer the most lucrative markets for our talent and our produce? The latest opinion poll suggests that independence would be rejected by a margin of around two to one. This, say some unionists, means there is no desire for a referendum on the question. Such an analysis is jejune and betrays a lack of imagination. The tax-raising powers proposed for Holyrood by the Calman report are also cited as a reason not to ask the people about independence. Britain's prime minister-in-waiting, though, drove his coach and horses through that last Wednesday when he kicked the report into the long grass. Our country would be energised by a referendum. In the months leading up to this plebiscite, every citizen of Scotland would have the opportunity to think long and hard about what this nation means to us. More Scots than ever before would become enfranchised in our political and democratic processes. Many of us would be forced to evaluate the services that we pay for now and how we prioritise them. Perhaps this ought to happen in a national election. A referendum on returning us to an independent state, though, will be the election of our lives. A democratically elected nationalist government has a right to present it and we have the right to take part in it.",I trust the people to save the Union | Kevin McKenna,2009-11-29T00:08:00Z,Kevin McKenna,politics
"When Rozina Akhtar, from Blackburn, declined an arranged marriage to a Pakistani first cousin, her father, Aurang Zeb, ignored her wishes. He duly became the first Briton to be made the subject of a forced marriage protection order. As undeterred by the courts as he was by the opinions of his wife and daughter, Mr Zeb began a campaign of intimidation, designed to salvage the family honour. He stalked his estranged wife and children, bombarded them with phone calls, speculated on the sentence for domestic murder (between five and seven years, he thought) and told his wife he was going to kill her and cut out her tongue. A couple of weeks ago, a judge gave him an exemplary punishment. Mr Zeb was fined £85 costs and told to do 200 hours of unpaid community service. Which is 50 fewer hours of community service than were imposed on a 19-year-old student whose crime was to piss, when blind drunk, on a Sheffield war memorial. The government is probably wise, given the complex business of assessing human culpability, to introduce children to the evils of domestic violence before they are able to read. At five, few will quibble when teachers insist, obviously using age-appropriate learning materials, that there must be zero tolerance of domestic violence. It would be an unlucky teacher who, perhaps having acted out a cautionary tale, with an angry teddy playing the part of Mr Zeb, encountered a child who questions the indulgence shown to this horrible man (whose family, even after his sentence, were too scared to comment). Five-year-olds are unlikely to comprehend the type of adult violence that this extension to the curriculum is designed to address, let alone remark on the dismaying contrast between their lessons and judicial reality. Although it is possible, I suppose, that some young, regularly chastised victims will wonder at what point parental smacking becomes an officially abusive relationship of the type they are being warned against. Or can you hit grown-ups, too, so long as you don't leave a mark? Pointless as the lessons will be for small children, many of whom will have gathered that hurting others is wrong, they must be thankless indeed for teachers who are requested, again, to wrestle with unacceptable forms of social behaviour so as to absolve the government from further responsibility. Chris Keates, of the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers (NASUWT), says that ""tackling bullying, violence and other inappropriate behaviour towards women and young girls is central to schools' purpose"". Are the violent experiences of boys less ""central""? If not, why reserve this form of cruelty for special, sustained consideration? Despicable as it is, male violence against women is less common than male violence against men. NASUWT's curiously emphatic endorsement can only add to doubts about the precepts to be contained in these homilies on the good domestic life. Not to mention the authority of the instructors. With physics, French or maths, there are at least qualifications to be inspected. Where compulsory lessons on adult relationships are concerned, there seems to be little guarantee that the teachers will be significantly more happy or emotionally literate than, for example, the children's parents, who can only hope the approved instructors inspire more confidence than their ultimate boss, children's minister and alleged bully, Ed Balls. Though perhaps Balls himself has been damaged by exposure to his notoriously intemperate boss, Mr Brown, who recently had such difficulty with those ""window dressing"" allegations from cabinet escapee Caroline Flint. One answer, as Ms Flint will know, for girls who need to escape controlling or abusive men is independence. Their best hope of independence lies in a good education, possibly one in which academic instruction, as opposed to bouts of preaching, is used to inculcate decent behaviour. So far, parents have been remarkably docile as the government has encroached further into what was once their territory. As well as sex, it now concerns itself with social justice, body image, citizenship, emotional wellbeing, self-esteem, diversity: just about every area, in fact, where there is some social problem and a perception that parental attitudes lag behind Harriet Harman's. Perhaps because so many of them share their anxieties about ""broken Britain"", parents seem willing to accept politicians' determination that this form of instruction should have compulsory parity with, say, maths or English. Not that they have much choice. In Wasted, his lively tirade against the politicisation of education, Frank Furedi deplores the eclipse of formal education by the more modish ""learning society"", that useful vehicle for government attitudinising. ""When the question is posed, 'What should be done?'"" he writes, ""the answer is the now formulaic solution, that it should be dealt with in the national curriculum."" For example, he says, in their role as agents of reform, teachers have recently been charged ""with training children to adopt, among other things, environmental values, become active citizens, embrace multiculturalism and diversity, fight discrimination, eschew homophobia, adopt healthy eating habits and internalise government guidelines on relationships and sex"". The government could retort that it's early days. Be fair: give them a decade or so before you rubbish this training in the art of living. One day, the latest lessons in sex and nutrition, drink and drugs may produce a new type of chaste, slender, sober, perpetually non-violent British citizen, completely superior to his or her parents, whose values will transform society. Some of these paragons may also be able to read. At present, however, the prevalence of youthful drinking and sex, along with drug-taking, bullying and obesity, have not, quite, declined to the point where most parents will readily accept their manifest inferiority as moral guides. There appears to be no evidence that the lessons improve conduct at all. In fact, there is every chance that the government would do better, if it wanted to enforce good behaviour, to extend support to the vulnerable and apply existing laws to perpetrators. One properly banged-up Mr Zeb, for instance, might be worth five years of anti-domestic violence teaching. Instead, as the conventional subject-based curriculum falls out of favour, conduct initiatives multiply. Among recent proposals for the improvement of society through the medium of its hapless pupils and teachers, Furedi cites training in Britishness, personal finance and happiness. Within the last few weeks, educators have urged that careers advice for seven-year-olds and primary school sex lessons be fitted into the curriculum, along with the new scheme to teach the especial wrongness of domestic violence. It cannot be long, given society's even greater abhorrence of such acts, before instruction on not peeing on war memorials is added to the ever-growing list of educational essentials.","So many weird lessons, yet so little time for proper teaching | Catherine Bennett",2009-11-29T00:07:42Z,Catherine Bennett,society
"Was anywhere heading for a fall so obviously as Dubai? Yet why did no one ever scream? Why did everyone just marvel? When I first visited the place three years ago, it was already the most dangerous speculative bubble on earth. Breakneck building – using reputedly a quarter of the world's cranes – was sustained on hysterical public relations and $80bn of debt. By last March the signs of impending doom were everywhere. Property and stock market prices were falling and only the PR firms were still sustaining morale, witness a cringing ITV documentary by Piers Morgan and grovelling coverage of Sol Kerzner's ""world's biggest"" hotel launch. Building projects worth a reported $300bn were stopping work overnight. Yet anyone who wrote a word of the impending doom was excoriated. The Guardian was subjected to a campaign of abusive emails when I reflected on the clear parallel with Shelley's Ozymandias and his trunkless legs of stone: ""Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair."" What had I against Dubai, they complained. Why could I not recognise the future in Dubai's glorious confidence and its open welcome to the world? The enclave's dictator, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, told critics simply: ""Shut up."" I still have no doubt that Dubai will survive, despite its lack of oil or other natural resources. But it will do so as a benighted settlement on the Gulf shore, in hock to neighbouring and more cautious oil-rich states, such as Abu Dhabi. Its luxury apartments will become tenements to an ever shifting army of refugees from the torments of the Islamic world. Its towers will stand empty, unable to afford their energy-guzzling services. Its fantasy islands will be squatted or will rot and sink back into the sea. Where fresh water will come from, who knows? But before the desert sands close over it, Dubai's lesson should be learned. It is the oldest in the book. Like the credit crunch in the west, the short route to folly is the belief that what goes up need never come down and there is no such thing as bad money. The parastatal corporation Dubai World has a staggering $60bn in liabilities. This is reputedly at risk, along with investments in a multitude of British and American companies, from ports and property to Turnberry golf course, Alton Towers and Travelodge. The moral is, don't believe public relations when it flies in the face of history. Don't believe those who say their credit is secure against nothing more solid than a villa bought off-plan by a few Hollywood celebrities. Above all, don't believe the financial press, which did more than anything to boost the self-delusion and architectural bombast of the Dubai authorities.

"This could only happen in France, and I say that in the spirit of humblest admiration: an internet campaign has started up to stop Renault naming its next car Zoe. One of a number of online petitions, launched by Sebastien Mortreux, starts: ""Our daughters have a beautiful first name that must not be associated with a car, so let us unite to bring pressure on a multinational which is going to destroy this pretty name for our children. It is a scandal that they are able to use common first names for products."" I couldn't agree more. And it's doubly vexing for me, because I only changed my name from Bedford Rascal in the first place to avoid confusion with the van. Names have a very tangible value in France, which is the only way they could ever spark these territorial battles. I blame the philosophical nature of the French.

The concept of the appellation d'origine contrôlée (rather a rigid system in which you can't refer to a Puy lentil unless it literally comes from Puy) was built around this determined assertion that name, reputation, authenticity – these rather elusive qualities – had a calculable value that was distinct from the thing named, the lentil itself; and a value, furthermore, that could be protected by decree. This was a version of copyright for a simpler time. In the 15th century the reputation of Roquefort was pretty well protected by the king. But the modern market can find a workaround for anything: the appellation stipulates that the cheeses should be aged in the Combalou caves of Roquefort-sur-Soulzon. Now, however, some cheeses – according to a Neal's Yard Dairy cheese buyer – are often just popped in to the caves for the minimum amount of time required for authenticity and moved elsewhere. Does this mean that the name ""Roquefort"" is now synonymous with no more than ""cheese that has been shifted around a lot""? By this cheesy parable, I seek to illustrate that you can go too far. A zeal for regulation can work against quality; better cheese is doubtless produced by makers with no name to protect, and no arcane rules to follow. But then, a French person might argue that British food regulation (""Has it got E coli? No? Good stuff"") has developed its lackadaisical attitude only because we have no names worth protecting. Maybe the Cornish pasty. But in the end, that is just meat, in a pasty. Renault and Roquefort also illustrate a wider habit of the market, which is to ceaselessly appropriate humanity's every original thought, every fillip of energy, every association with or memory of quality or pleasure, in the business of selling things. Rules don't help, since nothing delights the vandalism of innovation more than breaking a rule, in spirit if not in letter. A Renault spokesman, Valerian David, replied to all the criticism with this: ""It is a name that evokes values of femininity, of youth, a playful spirit and vivacity."" I mean, even if that's true (I'm working tirelessly in the opposite direction), it is a signal of how shameless this manufacturer is to look its flesh-and-blood customers in the eye and say: ""All those attractive traits of yours, all the things that make you you and make you alive, those things that people will recall with a tear during your funeral oration … we're going to attach them to this prosaic heap of metal."" People respond peculiarly badly when this sort of thing comes from a car manufacturer. It's fine when it's a bar, or a shoe, or a lampshade; such things are all a little bit fun or homy. But the motor industry (amusingly, since it's caught in this vice of crisis and failure: the credit crunch from one side, and peak oil from the other) still represents Big Business, and as such it has no call to be stealing our names – feminine, playful, vivacious or not. I find it more depressing when a company steals not just a name, but a mindset or trait. I'm thinking of Nike's Just Do It campaign: Jolie Solomon, writing in Newsweek in the 90s, called this ""the deftest of marketing tricks: to be both anti-establishment and mass market"". But it's not deft, is it? It's simple theft. Like Madonna in a Che Guevara T-shirt, it appropriates echoes of rebellion, individuality, freedom, spontaneity, in the encouragement of the most supine, unoriginal, servile act of buying the same T-shirt or album everyone else has. In the end, however, I wonder whether it doesn't give companies more than they deserve, to object in this way. Not in the sense that all publicity is good publicity (though I suppose that applies too – we do all now know that Renault has a new car coming out); but rather, it accords the car too much power to think that it could ever besmirch any name. It's a very rare object that can even successfully inhabit the name of its inventor, let alone make a grab for a name that takes its fancy. This car, along with every other con or mischief perpetrated by any given marketing department since stuff was invented, is just an attempt to anthropomorphise a thing, to make us desire it the way we desire one another. Why petition against it? There's no need. It never works.","Sure, they can take my name. But it will be in vain | Zoe Williams",2009-11-25T22:00:01Z,Zoe Williams,world
"Conventional wisdom can be right, but more often than not it is wrong. Worryingly, two highly conventional economic assumptions lie at the heart of the Queen's speech. The first is that there is no more important challenge facing the country than eliminating the budget deficit as quickly as possible – and the government wants to bind itself legally to this objective. The second is that more capital, sensible bonuses and requiring banks to indicate how they would wind themselves up when in trouble will eliminate the risk of a second banking crisis. It is a twin bet – but the assumptions behind both propositions are highly questionable. In unconventional times it would have been more heartening to see some unconventional – and cleverer – thinking. Begin with the financial crisis. British banking assets are five times our national output; they were twice national output 20 years ago. Capital underpinning those assets has shrunk by five times. The City claimed it could manage the enormous risk through fanciful new techniques. It could not. As a result Britain has spent an astonishing £1.3tn in guarantees, liquidity provision and recapitalisation to avoid depression – with scant recognition or apology from the City at the scale of the mistake. All the evidence is that unravelling the mess will take at least a decade. Bank assets have to shrink and the economy has to grow, and gradually the size of the banking sector in relation to the rest of the economy will become more manageable and less risky. But economics 101 spells out that if bankers save, businesses save and consumers simultaneously save – the realistic prospect ahead – then if the government does not spend and borrow we will face a prolonged period of economic stagnation. This, warns Richard Koo, chief economist of Nomura International, is what confronted Japan after its banking crisis. It now confronts us. The right response is to retain every policy lever to hand, including high government borrowing, and pull it if necessary. But the government has given in to the fiscal conservatives. It has pre-committed itself to a downward path of borrowing irrespective of economic conditions. Either it will do this, in which case it will be self-defeating as in Japan. Or it won't do this because it is self-defeating – in which case the commitment, as the LSE's Professor Buiter says, is a con. What was wanted is a pragmatic approach – a commitment to lower borrowing but recognition that the downward path may be uneven and unpredictable. The financial services bill should have been about the root and branch reform of Britain's financial system – breaking up banks, proposing at the very least the separation of the trading of casino derivatives from mainstream banking, proposing new public banks to lend to business and finance infrastructure and reshaping the entire ""shadow"" banking system. The call for more capital is the lowest common denominator, conventional view – and is wholly dependent on what is agreed internationally in Basel. Judging by Basel 1 in 1988 and Basel 2 in 2004 we can expect the process to be interminable and the result minimalist. The bankers' protests about the approach to bonuses shows they have learned little. Bonuses are private contractual matters, they say, and not a matter for the state. But without taxpayer guarantees there would be no bonuses or even a banking industry. The regulator should have a view on what constitutes a risky bonus, and on this the government is right. It is a sign of how far the argument for financial reform has slipped, that it finds itself so on the defensive about a palpably sensible measure. But it wants it both ways – to be loved by the City even while it regulates it. It has ended up pleasing no one – an epitaph for Gordon Brown's government.",Conventional wisdom won't save the economy | Will Hutton,2009-11-18T17:39:00Z,Will Hutton,politics
"An icy breeze is making the Scottish National party shiver and gather its cloak more tightly about itself. A question is being asked that previously no one dared whisper: has Alex Salmond lost his mojo? When he has tapped his conjuror's hat recently, only plums have emerged. Not long ago, he walked on water and everywhere his gaze fell there was healing and bounty. Now, and for the first time since his party's Holyrood victory in 2007, his omniscience is being questioned. In the wake of Thursday's shattering byelection defeat in Glasgow North East, a second term in government following the 2011 Holyrood election does not now look as certain as it did in the summer. Glasgow's SECC, where the voting count took place, is a cavernous and unforgiving arena when you've just been humiliated in a byelection by a record majority. And it was hard not to feel for David Kerr, the SNP's beaten candidate, as he gamely tried to keep a desultory conversation going with his listless supporters just minutes after being told he had been beaten by more than 8,200 votes by Labour's Willie Bain. It wasn't far away from 2am and Kerr, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed for his entire doomed campaign in one of Labour's Glasgow redoubts, suddenly appeared tired, vulnerable and out of his depth. Twice now he has been beaten by wide margins in byelections and it may be that even the continuing obsessive patronage of Salmond may now not be enough to insinuate him on to future SNP lists. The nationalists have comprehensively been escorted from the premises in the last two Scottish byelections, and at either side of the country, but they will persist with their claim that little can be read into the latest defeat in a socialist enclave and on a 33% turnout. Last night, though, party activists, particularly on the west coast, were looking for answers to some questions that even Salmond's political legerdemain cannot simply magic away any time soon. For an unpopular party in government, in the midst of a recession, to achieve almost 60% of the vote and enjoy a swing in their favour, is almost unprecedented in recent UK political history. No one expected the SNP to win in Glasgow North East, but privately they were hoping for a Labour majority of only 3,000 at the most. Such a number would have reinforced the nationalists' old war cry that Labour is still on the run in some of their heartlands. To have lost by almost three times that amount in a two-horse race has rent the cloak of invincibility that up until now has wrapped itself so comfortably around the Holyrood party. Why, some activists, are asking, did the party almost entirely extinguish any talk of independence on the doorsteps of Glasgow North East? ""It's not as if we had anything to lose here,"" said one, ""and as public revulsion at the antics of Westminster has grown we would have been on safe ground talking up the benefits of going it alone. Yet it was hardly mentioned."" Others have gamely tried to adopt the lexicon of a provincial football manager who has just seen his team draw against Celtic after surrendering a two-goal lead: ""We've won one and lost one in two of Labour's urban fastnesses. That would have been unthinkable three years ago."" But what is three years in politics if a week is a long time? For, as gloomy SNP strategists know, the political terrain has changed, and changed utterly in the last year. Salmond, previously the master of all he surveyed in the Holyrood chamber, has been well beaten at First Minister's Questions by Iain Grey in recent weeks. The Labour leader has nailed his SNP counterpart on the cost of an independence referendum and on Salmond's failure to turn up for any meetings of FiSAB, the group charged with looking for ways out of the recession. Grey no longer approaches FMQs with the hapless demeanour of a Bedouin window cleaner. He was also a relaxed and welcome presence during the byelection campaign. As one senior source confided on Friday night: ""The Jim Murphy effect is having a very positive effect on Iain."" Murphy, whom the SNP now view as a Scottish Mandelson, was all sweet reason and Buddhist calm as he dominated BBC Scotland's excellent byelection special. If something approaching mythical status has been conferred on Salmond, then the same has attached itself to the SNP campaign machines. From out of the mist in previous campaigns, it seemed, armies of fresh young volunteers would suddenly appear to save the day just as it seemed the separatist army was about to be engulfed by the fell forces of the union. But Labour's operations in Glasgow and in Glenrothes last year are now just as slick and in 2011 their war chest will not be three times lighter than the SNP's, as it was in 2007. This is troubling news for the SNP at the next Scottish election. In 2007, Labour's complacency and strategic weakness handed the Nats the slimmest of victories. There are signs, most evident in Glasgow North East, that Labour has found ways of targeting its core support a lot more effectively. Salmond and his cabinet, none of whom has been removed in 30 months, may not quite be in retreat. But with barely 18 months until the next Holyrood election, Labour may have timed its reawakening to perfection.",The SNP suddenly looks vulnerable | Kevin McKenna,2009-11-15T00:05:12Z,Kevin McKenna,politics
"This is remembrance week, when we are supposed to wear a poppy or stand in silence and remember those who have fallen. And yet we seem to have a problem with memory – especially when it comes to peace and war. We tell ourselves we will never forget and yet, when we debate the war in which British troops are fighting and dying, we are saddled with a national amnesia. Part of the problem is distraction. In the last day or so we have been diverted by a row over the prime minister's handwriting, the Sun reading into Gordon Brown's scratchy scrawl – a function of his visual impairment – a callous disregard for the war dead. It's a cruel and shabby exercise by the Sun, one that exploits the understandable rage of a bereaved mother. But it does nothing to rid us of our forgetfulness. And with Afghanistan there is so much we have forgotten. ""There is no sense that we sought to crush and dominate this country throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries,"" says Dan Plesch, director of the Centre for International Studies and Diplomacy at the School of Oriental and African Studies. ""We have no memory of that – but the Afghans do."" Or, if we were in the rolling White House debate – apparently due to bear fruit soon – over what to do next in Afghanistan, we might remember the last time the US and its allies feared they were about to get sucked into a foreign quagmire. The arguments pushed now were offered then, including the one made by Boris Johnson this week: ""To pull out now ... would be the biggest betrayal of those who have given their lives so far."" Advocates of escalation in Vietnam used to say that, too: we have to send more men to die, otherwise those already dead will have died in vain. Or we might remember the last time a mighty superpower tried to master unruly Afghanistan. The Soviet Union invaded in 1979, and within a few years their young men were losing their limbs or their lives to landmines – the IEDs of their day – amid ever angrier complaints about a shortage of helicopters. Whatever other reactions we should have to the fate of the US-led coalition in Afghanistan – horror, grief, despair – surprise should not be among them. But there is more we should be remembering. For that is the heart of the matter: we have forgotten why we went in there in the first place. It was sold to us on a simple and compelling premise. It was an act of self-defence, in response to 9/11. Al-Qaida was the enemy, it had taken root in Afghanistan, and so it was legitimate to hit back. The objective was to capture and kill Osama bin Laden and prevent al-Qaida using Afghanistan as a base from which to launch further attacks. Now, though, that logic seems a fairly distant memory. Few argue that al-Qaida has a presence in Afghanistan any more: Bin Laden's men have been chased across the border into Pakistan, or scattered around the globe. So now the objective is something else entirely – to defeat the Taliban, which once hosted Bin Laden, and to reshape Afghanistan into a functioning society that will be permanently inhospitable to al-Qaida. What President Obama now has to decide is if he accepts this larger mission. The current signals are that he does, and that while he may not give General Stanley McChrystal the 40,000 extra troops he asked for, he is expected to send 30,000 – an ""uplift"" from the 68,000 US troops there now (itself a doubling of the number when George W Bush left office). There are powerful reasons to be glum about that news. For it seems a bizarre case of triple-locking the stable door after the horse has bolted. If al-Qaida remains the ultimate enemy, rather than the Taliban, then it's folly to lavish so much blood and treasure on the taming of Afghanistan. Ministers constantly say our troops are fighting in that country to keep us safe in this one. But everyone knows the terror plots against Britain were not hatched in Afghanistan but in Pakistan and Britain itself. Moreover, al-Qaida is now active in Somalia, southern Nigeria and Indonesia, among other places. Attacks on the west no longer need training hideouts in Tora Bora. They can be plotted in Dewsbury. The alternative before Obama is the one advocated by his vice-president. Joe Biden's plan would return to something much closer to the original 2001 mission, replacing grandiose counter-insurgency with focused counter-terrorism. Instead of occupying the entire country, western forces would hunker down in a few bases on both sides of the Afghan-Pakistan border. From there they could mount hit and run raids, striking at targets that were, or threatened to become, al-Qaida bases. Sometimes these raids would involve special forces; sometimes unmanned drones, attacking from the air. The appeal of this approach is that now it would be the Taliban – rather than British and US troops – who would be on the defensive. Instead of mounting a permanent occupation – one committed to the apparently futile goal of turning wild Afghanistan into stable, prosperous Sweden – they would be engaged in the kind of muscular police work that public opinion thought it was signing up for eight years ago. But there are risks here, too. It's possible that al-Qaida will be smart enough not to regroup, preferring to stay where it is fighting now, in the guerrilla-friendly Waziristan region of Pakistan. Those that do come back to Afghanistan hoping to evade Nato's grasp would be spoilt for places to hide. The coalition could find itself in a perennial game of Whac-a-mole, striking al-Qaida in one place only to see it pop up somewhere else. More gravely, the counter-terror approach has a troubled past. It was the supposedly focused war on terror that brought us secret prisons, extraordinary rendition, torture and the killing of civilians in bungled attempts at targeted assassination. If a Biden plan were to succeed, it would have to produce a strategy shorn of the techniques that aroused such hatred in the Arab and Muslim world in particular, thereby doing Bin Laden's job of recruitment for him. The best hope has to be that Obama is planning his uplift as a temporary measure, one that will enable him to declare victory before too long, so that he can then shift to a scaled-down strategy that might look a lot like the Biden plan. The realities of US domestic politics probably demand that he try another military push. But he should not be fooled into thinking even this approach represents a permanent solution. Foreign troops cannot stay for ever. Eventually they will have to withdraw and, if that is not to look like a defeat and trigger a return to the lawlessness in which terrorism could flourish once more, it will have to be negotiated along with Afghanistan's near neighbours, including not just Pakistan, but the likes of Iran, Russia and China. On the ground it will doubtless require a plunge into cynical realism, buying off local chieftans so that they remain immune to the blandishments of the Taliban and al-Qaida. None of these options is appealing; some will be unpalatable. But no more unpalatable than an endless procession of coffins draped in flags or Afghan villages strewn with the body parts of children. That is where we are now. We should remember that.",The coffins will keep coming until we conquer our amnesia on Afghanistan | Jonathan Freedland,2009-11-10T22:00:03Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"In 1634 a young man home on leave from the East India Company peeped inside a house near Lambeth Palace in London called the Ark. It belonged to John Tradescant, ""keeper of gardens, vines and silkworms"" to Charles I and an obsessive accumulator of objects. The young man was astounded by what he saw, where ""a man might in one day behold collected into one place more curiosities than if he spent all his life in travel"". It was a good definition of a museum. Tradescant's collection was to form the basis of Oxford's Ashmolean, claimed as the earliest modern museum in the world. Those of us familiar with the old place recall wandering its dusty passages and cramped chambers, where ghosts of pictures lost in storage jostled with classical nudes seemingly on their knees and begging for release from the gloom. It was here that Sir Arthur Evans buried his Minoan maidens and Lawrence of Arabia his oriental cloaks. Coins, tombs, bronzes, icons, stylae followed. Most of them disappeared from view. Tomorrow the museum reopens at double its previous size after a £61m hurricane has swept through the place. Nothing in Britain is remotely like it. The new Ashmolean's collection, from fine art to archaeology and design drawn from every age and every corner of the globe, is a microcosm of world civilisation, comparable in range only with New York's Metropolitan. This is the most exciting new museum anywhere in Britain. The classical Ashmolean facade of 1845 by CR Cockerell has been restored, its portico glaring across at the gothic Randolph Hotel opposite, like a bank manager trying to refuse Count Dracula a loan. Once inside and through the old foyer, we find that the doyen of museum architects, Rick Mather, has taken over. He has ingeniously contrived to fuse 39 new galleries on to the rear of the old building, rising six storeys to a glorious restaurant looking out over the roofs of Oxford. Somewhere in here are all the old favourites: the Knossos octopus, the Cycladic maiden, the Etruscan warrior, King Alfred's jewel, Powhatan's mantle, Uccello's hunt in the forest, the ""Messiah"" Stradivarius, Chantrey's worthies, the Raphael drawings, the noble Titians, Poussins, Van Dykes, Constables, Pre-Raphaelites and Impressionists. The finest gathering of Dutch still-lifes fills the walls of a single room, an electrifying cornucopia of lobsters, tulips and dead game. The Ashmolean's curators, under their director, Christopher Brown, have been bold in every sense. They have not only refashioned a great museum but clubbed visitors over the head with their novelty. The old chronology of world culture – ""one damned thing after another"" – has been shoehorned to fit the newly fashionable ""interpretation strategy"", built on the supposed interconnectedness of things and civilisations. Things are no problem, indeed I would have liked more of a mix of paintings and sculpture. It is sad that a room devoted to Tradescant's original Lambeth ""cabinet of curiosities"" is buried in a basement surrounded by galleries devoted to such leaden topics as conservation, writing and the human image. Tradescant should be put in pride of place in the main foyer, an hors d'oeuvre to the whole museum, much as the British Museum's enlightenment library evokes the drawing room of a Georgian collector. As for the interconnectedness of civilisations east and west, it risks becoming a didactic sledgehammer, ""Crossing cultures, crossing time"", reeking of 1990s New Labour and the ""joined-up"" museum. We can surely see a link between a Roman toga and an Indian sari, or between ceramic wares in differing cultures along the great silk road, without being hit over the head with it. Notices are like A-level multiple-choice papers, their grammar often appalling. Some of the archaeological rooms are classics of curators disempowering (as they would say) the objects and imposing a membrane of meaning between viewer and art. The message of a good museum is that the eye is the best teacher. The architectural style of the new half of the Ashmolean is a pastiche interwar ""moderne"", reminiscent of the penguin pool at London Zoo. It is svelte and the presence of so much art relieves its relentless abstraction. But it gives an illusion of a lot of architecture for relatively little display, noticeably in the two sweeping staircase atriums, now de rigeur at such museums as the National Portrait Gallery and the British Museum after the staircase disaster at the Tate Modern. The resulting expanse of white, empty walling yearns for pictures or tapestries. This is a museum, not an airport. The new display cases, many set heavily into the walls behind giant frames, reduce the impact of the objects that cower, half-hidden within. As a result, to wander from the Mather side of the building back into the old Cockerell side, which can be done on every floor, is the best way I know to experience the cultural dislocation of modernism. Cockerell is rich in greens and reds, in dark wood, gilt frames, cornices and door architraves. Here the works of art, especially the pictures, seem at home, as if content to be on the walls of houses for which they were intended. These galleries drop their shoulders and relax. When the Stradivarius was displayed in these surroundings, I am convinced I could hear it sing. On the new Mather side, every angle is hard, every colour white and the settings inimical to the context from which most of the objects have come. Sound is shrill. Doors and shutters are everywhere, opening and closing on approach as if in a high-security hospital operating theatre. Flickering videos preach the new engagement. Here the Stradivarius stands in its case, silent, aloof and untouchable, one more object frozen and conserved for eternity, never to be played. Such reservations are only partial and should not detract from the exhilaration of visiting this extraordinary museum – indeed they are stimulated by its argument. Mather's interiors are of the highest quality and Brown's interconnectedness of things can spring nice surprises, such as the similarity between Samuel Palmer's 19th-century portrait of himself and a mural painting of a young man from 2nd-century Egypt. Besides, Mather's spareness and Brown's holistic interpretation have come to be favoured by the 20th-century's museum grandees. The big museum project must surely be coming to an end, at least in the western world. The public sector is financially exhausted and private money and fancy architecture are turning elsewhere – in Boris Johnson's London, to the high-rise luxury flat. Fine arts will return to the Latin quarters, to local galleries and private collectors. Britain may see a revulsion against the giant accumulator museums such as the Ashmolean and the London megaliths, with their miles of underground shelving stashed with works kept from public view. Provincial galleries may start claiming some of the nation's loot of ages, and may get it. Such cash as is available may go their way. The more reason to greet this last cry of the old regime, confident in both its display and its argument. We may not see its like again.",Oxford's extraordinary old treasure chest revels in its new incarnation | Simon Jenkins,2009-11-05T21:30:01Z,Simon Jenkins,uk
"On that improbably warm night exactly one year ago, the crowd in Grant Park, Chicago, cheered itself hoarse as Barack Obama, the newly minted president-elect of the United States, stepped on stage and announced that ""change has come to America"". Of course they were cheering the passing of George Bush and the historic breakthrough of America's first black president. But the air that night was also heavy with imagining: the hordes in Grant Park, like those around the world punching the sky as they watched on TV, were picturing how different things might be with Obama in charge. Surely the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan would soon become memories, along with Camp X-Ray at Guantánamo Bay, which the new president had promised to close. Iran would clasp the hand Obama planned to extend, while Israelis and Palestinians would heed the president's promise to work for Middle East peace the moment he took office. The economy would soon be righted, the greed-merchants of Wall Street punished and tamed, and Obama would complete the long-unfinished work of his predecessors, finally bringing to the US what most other civilised nations take for granted: basic healthcare for all. Oh, and Obama would surely do what had to be done on climate change. Now, one year on, it can feel as if all that was a foolish mirage. The US is still fighting two wars; Guantánamo remains open, with no clear plan for its closure given that Congress has ruled that none of its inmates can be moved to the US; Iran has not yet agreed to anything; Middle East peace looks as distant as ever; the US economy is still limping, with unemployment around 10%; healthcare has provoked a congressional battle royal; and as for serious US action on climate change, don't hold your breath. As if to dramatise the contrast, television viewers in the US can tonight flip between the hope and the reality. HBO premieres a glossy documentary, By the People, recounting the excitement of Obama's 2008 odyssey. Over on the news channels, there will be live coverage of the expected Democratic defeat in the governor's race in Virginia, offsetting the victory Obama won there a year ago, with a similar rebuff feared in New Jersey. It would be silly to read too much into off-year election results, just as it would be to think that none of the hopes of a year ago have materialised. In fact, Obama can point to a solid start. The war in Iraq is being wound down. The economy has stabilised, thanks to a swiftly passed stimulus package worth $787bn. It may not have been enough; it may be taking too long to work. But it has helped, saving or creating more than 640,000 jobs, according to White House figures. And, with a minimum of fuss, he has put a liberal Hispanic woman on the supreme court. Still, this is not quite the degree of change people had in mind when they danced in the streets and honked their car horns into the small hours a year ago. Why has the big shift they anticipated not come about? The first answer sounds like a cop-out: blame the system. We imagine the US presidency to be the most powerful office on earth. But the reality is that, relatively speaking, an American president has less direct power than a British prime minister. He has no command over Congress; he cannot whip even his own party into line. They are a law unto themselves. Obama may have been utterly sincere in his desire to transform American healthcare. But he was always at the mercy of a handful of senators whose votes make the difference between success and failure. It is one of the great paradoxes of the American system. A country that acts in so many ways like a revolutionary society – from its creation myth to the personality cult that surrounds its founding fathers – is constituted to thwart all but the most incremental change. As Anna Quindlen wrote in a Newsweek essay on Obama's first year – coverline: Yes, he can (but he sure hasn't yet) – ""what our system has meant … is that very little of the big stuff gets done. It simply can't."" Which is why universal healthcare has appeared on the to-do list of presidents going back as far as Teddy Roosevelt. If Obama hasn't cracked this one yet, he is merely joining a century-old club. Some have faulted the president for failing to make good on his signature promise to heal the rift between red and blue states, to end the rancour that separates Republicans from Democrats. But here the blame surely rests not on his shoulders, nor even on the system, but on his opponents. He has reached out countless times – trying to woo Republicans by stuffing his stimulus package with tax cuts, for example – but they have repeatedly rebuffed him. What's more, beyond Washington Obama has faced an opposition that is shocking in its vitriol. Bowing down to the twin gods of Sarah Palin and the Fox News blowhard Glenn Beck, these rightists have set about depicting Obama as a socialist, a Stalinist, a Nazi, a Muslim and a foreigner posing as a native-born US citizen. They are backed by serious corporate money, a cable TV and talk radio fraternity unconstrained by any duty to the facts, and a network of enablers in Congress. They are an implacable foe and have made Obama's promised bipartisanship impossible. Still, none of this should let Obama off the hook for his own errors. As a candidate, he let expectations get unfeasibly high: he could only ever disappoint. More seriously, as president he has too often left a vacuum where his own plans and vision should be. He left the details of healthcare up to Congress, where things got mired and the opposition stole the initiative – forcing him to ride to the rescue, saving the day with a spellbinding speech. He pulled that trick several times as a candidate, but it will soon wear thin. Some have said his prime failing is not to have crafted a single narrative that might bind the disparate elements of his programme, from health to the economy to climate change. (Many of us used to say the same about New Labour.) But sometimes Obama's mistakes are more basic. On Israel-Palestine he should never have issued a demand he wasn't ready to enforce: by insisting Israel freeze all settlements on the West Bank, only to back down, he has lost face in a region where face counts above all. So Obama marks the anniversary of his election contemplating those things that have held him back, both from within and without. Despite it all, he can point to much that should hearten those who wish him well. His rolling seminar on Afghanistan suggests a president who is deliberate and thoughtful – a welcome contrast with a predecessor who underwent only a ""gutcheck"" before hurling thunderbolts from the sky. And he can plausibly argue that plenty might come right sooner than we think. That healthcare bill could be ready in less than a week. If Iran says yes to the current uranium enrichment deal, Obama will secure a victory that might even justify that premature Nobel prize: defusing what could have been a cataclysmic nuclear threat without firing a shot. Besides, Obama is not on the same timetable as us journalists. He does not need to get it right after 100 days or one year. He just needs to get it right.

"Does Ed Balls lie quaking in his bed at night, realising that many otherwise sane and reasonable parents would cheerfully boil him in tar if they thought it would get their child into a decent school? Does our schools secretary look at the recent sharp rise in appeals for primary places, and have any idea of the extremes people would go to in order to give their children the best start? Well maybe he does, and that's why he intends to criminalise them. An inquiry starting tomorrow will take a much more hardline approach to people who lie and cheat to get their children into the best state schools. Under current rules, a parent caught, say, renting flats in catchment areas, or pretending a friend or relative's address is their own, would just fail to get the school place. With the new proposals, they will face court summons, community service and fines. This is happening now because, earlier this year, Harrow council failed to convict Mrinal Patel under the Fraud Act 2006, after she put down her mother's address as her own to get her son into a school. The crux being they couldn't prove that Patel stood to gain ""financially"" from her actions. Such a shame for Harrow: had they merely had to prove she stood to gain ""emotionally"", they would have won – as Patel's joy and relief at seeing her child happy and settled in a good school would have been palpable, the evil conniving cow. Only this line of thinking doesn't quite scan does it? Even if they wouldn't go as far as Patel, most parents could relate to her desperation. In fact, this new legislation could be one of those defining Spartacus moments for British parenthood . Lying and cheating to get into schools is nothing new. I remember wishing I could think of a way to lie and cheat my daughter into the best local (oversubscribed) state primary. However, I didn't have the guts to lie about my address, and I'd been too slow on the uptake for the God Scam (involving the ""astonishing"" burst of parental religious fervour and church attendance that occurs just before primary school admission). In the end I appealed, with a personal statement so pathetic, grovelling and mendacious (""Your summer fete has long been a highlight on our family calendar!""), that after reading it, a friend asked if I could pass him the wastepaper basket. Was I ashamed? Not even a teeny bit. Was it my fault there was only one really decent state primary in the area? Which is something Balls' inquiry should take on board. If parents are resorting to lying and cheating to get their children a half-decent education, then it is the government's ""catchment lottery"", their failure to provide enough decent primary schools, that's at fault. Clearly, the schools these parents do have access to are below par, and this, not their frantic reaction, is what is criminal. It would also serve Balls well to remember a past attempt to criminalise parents regarding schooling – which was when they decided to prosecute them when their children persistently truanted. From what I recall, a stressed single mother was jailed, screwing up her family even more, and most people felt sorry for her. That went well didn't it? One predicts it will be the same with attempts to criminalise parents who lie for schools admissions. The real irony being that the government could leave things as they are – people caught out and denied the school place they were desperate for. As any parent could tell you, this is punishment enough. Sam, ditch the boy as fast as you can. For your own sake I would like to say that I feel the deepest joy for Sam Taylor-Wood, the 42-year-old artist, who has just announced her engagement to 19-year-old Aaron Johnson, the star of her Lennon biopic Nowhere Boy. I would like to say that, but what I actually have to say is – good God woman, what are you playing at? Granted, Taylor-Wood's former husband, art dealer, Jay Jopling, 45, had that well-publicised romance with 24-year-old Lily Allen, but still, isn't getting engaged taking a ""revenge shag"" too far? This isn't double standards. When Jopling was with Allen, he often resembled a kindly, slightly sweaty, uncle, draped over her because he was having a heart attack. But really, I couldn't care less about age gaps and truly believe that even huge gaps work fine in the right circumstances. Who doesn't cherish the line uttered by Joan Collins when she married her much younger husband: ""If he dies, he dies.""? Likewise, Barbara Windsor just cheekily announced that she is retiring from EastEnders to spend more time with her husband, because: ""He's not getting any younger."" However, both these men are in their 40s, which is officially ""grown up"". Marrying a boy of 19 – come off it. Most women in their 40s would rather drink Toilet Duck. It doesn't help matters that Taylor-Wood cuts such a confusing figure. She's a supposedly avant garde conceptual artist who always looks far too pleased to find herself with celebrity mates on the red carpet. More and more, over the years, she has struck me as the art world's Trudi Styler – not a good look. However, never mind that. Does Taylor-Wood really need this young guy, sweet-looking though he is, skateboarding through her life, with his baseball cap on backwards, driving her insane with Twitter, as she desperately struggles to look ""with it""? Have the lessons of Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore not been learnt? Unless she is the rarest and luckiest of exceptions, Taylor-Wood must be careful not to make the mistake of aping the classic ""older man"" delusion – which is that they are as young as the body they feel. Man or woman, it's usually the younger half of the partnership who ends up with the far better deal. It's a little late for Wigan to come over all shocked at King Shame on those in court who shouted about ""institutionalised racism"" and ""Steven Gerrard walking free"" when black Wigan Athletic footballer, Marlon King, was found guilty of sexual assault and ABH and jailed for 18 months. Gerrard was involved in a ruck with other males and found not guilty. King, a married father, furious at having his groping advances ignored in a nightclub, punched a female student so hard that her nose broke. His behaviour had nothing to do with race and everything to do with a certain brand of male ultra-entitlement erupting into violence. One saw this again in the heartbreaking Cutting Edge documentary about Katie Piper, a one-time model-TV presenter, whose former boyfriend arranged to have acid thrown in her face, leaving her partially blind and disfigured. Some men give themselves permission to punish women who dare to reject them. After King was found guilty, Wigan announced that he had been fired. Well done, one thought. Then it emerged that King had several previous convictions to his name, including violence against women, which were committed before he signed for Wigan. So what are Wigan saying – that it was all right for King to have been violent towards women, just not while he was playing for them? Why King was fired by Wigan is now a matter of public record. The justification for hiring men like him remains a murkier issue altogether.","If parents lie, whose fault is that, Mr Balls? | Barbara Ellen",2009-11-01T00:05:10Z,Barbara Ellen,politics
"Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother: The Official Autobiography by William Shawcross 1,000pp, Macmillan, £25 For the Queen Mother, writes William Shawcross, as he trudges through the second half of her life, ""one decade glided into another, with the basic pattern of her days, weeks, months and years being fairly constant"". For much of his biography he is remarkably persuasive on this point. Chapter after chapter of his interminable chronicle glides, or rather drags, repetitively past, allowing the few things that did change to stand out in lurid contrast. One year, for instance, she acquired a stairlift. But there must have been more to it than that. The Queen Mother was deeply in debt most of the time. And the arrival on the public stage of Prince Charles's mistress, Camilla Parker Bowles, for example, must have caused a temporary wrinkle in the serene old lady's gin, nags'n'picnics routine. For grandmother and grandson were close. And considering her feelings about Wallis Simpson, who went to her grave unforgiven, and later about Peter Townsend, the Queen Mother must have had some views on the divorcee who saw off Diana. Concerning Wallis, she wrote at the height of the abdication crisis: ""If Mrs Simpson is not fit to be Queen, she is not fit to be the King's morganatic wife."" What, then, did she make of Charles's ambitious mistress? The woman features here only once, on page 795, identified as the wife of a royal guest, Andrew Parker Bowles: theirs is a joint entry in a 1970s Castle of Mey visitors' book. The author devotes far more space to the Queen Mother's lunches, to the decorations on her millions of hats, to her horses, to the various inert objects he spots then solemnly itemises, as if in training for the world championships of the tray game. Among the ornaments arranged on a Castle of Mey desk, he doggedly reports, is ""a little corgi from the Buckingham Palace gift shop"". It sits there now. The Queen Mother's house, Shawcross assures us, ""is preserved as it was in her lifetime"". He has chosen to do the same thing for her reputation. If it's hard to respect a biographer capable of an omission on the Camilla scale, it is impossible to trust him. What else has he left out? Shawcross records Princess Margaret's vandal decision to destroy letters from Diana to the Queen Mother because, she said, they were ""so private"". Given his determination to empathise, at all times, with the royal point of view, his comment on this affair may be read as savagely critical: ""It was understandable, although regrettable from a historical viewpoint."" From that perspective, this biographer appears to be at his most usefully unguarded in the first fifth of the Queen's 101 years. Possibly because it was long ago, Shawcross is willing to depict his heroine, during the first world war, as a giddy airhead gripped by her prodigious appetites for food, clubs, clothes, cocktails, dancing, chocs, actors, shopping and men in uniform, including chauffeurs. The nautical look had a particularly stimulating effect. Elizabeth Bowes Lyon was only 15 when she wrote a characteristically coarse letter to her governess: the Firth of Forth was heaving, she reported, with ""simply hundreds of beautiful brown lieutenants, subs, snotties (midshipmen), Admirals and sailors. Oh my! They were all most amorous!"" Not that she was unaware there was a war on. ""I feel as if I never want to go to a dance again,"" she wrote in 1918. ""One only makes friends and then they are killed."" Long before she would express her thankfulness at having been bombed, so as to look the East End in the face, the ill-educated Elizabeth complained bitterly at having had to travel to the same area, where she failed her school certificate. ""What was the use of toiling down to that – er – place Hackney?"" she demanded. But no sooner had this droll but frightful-sounding young woman accepted a proposal from the stammering Duke of York (having strung him along for a year or two), than such disagreeable sentiments were never heard again. Like her personality, the Queen Mother's epistolary style appears to have been transformed, on the instant of betrothal, into everything that is pious and dignified, sympathetic and charming. Unless we have Shawcross to thank for this unblemished characterisation of a boozy actress who more recently, according to the journalist Edward Stourton, said the EU would never work, because of ""all those Huns, wops and dagos"". In his diaries, her loyal friend the late Woodrow Wyatt recorded, with more tact ""She clearly has some reservations about Jews in her old-fashioned way"". ""I'm not as nice as you think,"" she used to tell him. Eleanor Roosevelt suspected something of the sort, noting Elizabeth's gift for ""turning on graciousness like water"". Shawcross, who is probably more queen motherly than the Queen Mother, will have none of it. ""She may have been a brilliant actress,"" he allows, ""but her feelings were genuine."" Really? It comes to something when a biographer's partiality is repeatedly exposed by the testimony of his own subject. Why can't poor women live on tea and ""some buns"", wondered this legendary trencherwoman, during the depression. In another letter, written after a bomb hit Buckingham Palace, we find her moved by a visit to the East End, where 200 people had died under a school. PS, she writes: ""Dear old BP is still standing and that is the main thing"". So we learned something, after all. • This article was amended on 26 October 2009.

"Dare one watch Nick Griffin on this week's Question Time or would it be safer to hide in the cupboard under the stairs? Possibly switching off the television, en route, in case some of his power somehow seeps out of the set, penetrates the layers of damp newspaper and duct tape that you are advised to have ready, then passes through the epidermis in the manner of a nanoparticle. The merest chink and you might emerge from that cupboard a Nazi. Not since the great charlatan and hypnotist Franz Mesmer demonstrated that a wave of his wand could reduce crowds of patients to insensate obedience can the effect of one man's magnetism been so dreaded – or acclaimed. Unless, I suppose, you count Adolf Hitler. Or Gerry Adams, though Mrs Thatcher's belief in the beguiling sound of his voice was not widely shared. The mesmerising effect of Griffin, however, is so widely acknowledged as to have become almost an established fact, accepted by supporters and opponents alike. Of the latter, some, like Peter Hain, believe the man's plausibility to be so lethal that the BBC should never have offered Griffin a platform upon which to proclaim his hateful opinions. Unless what Mr Hain actually thinks is that other people are so stupid they will respond with idiot enthusiasm to Griffin's various euphemisms for hating non-Aryan people. The ""non-indigenous"" is what the BNP leadership prefers to call them these days. Maybe, as an audience, we are so utterly thick that we will fail to see any obvious flaws in Griffin's proposal for walls to separate for good the ethnic groups in places like Oldham and Burnley. And maybe, when we see that Griffin has clean hair and a pastel shirt and tie, we'll believe him when he says he never meant what he said in the 1990s about using ""fists and boots"" and that all such unwholesome policies have now been ""decommissioned"". After all, he got away with it on Andrew Marr's show. For Griffin's supporters, his personality is so magnetic that even when he is surrounded by intelligent non-racists on Question Time, their leader's exemplary bigotry will prevail. On the party's home page, its membership's certainty that exposure cannot be other than a PR triumph is demonstrated with a large digital ""Countdown to Question Time"" clock. Hundreds of comments pledge absolute faith in Griffin's ability and crow over the selection of his fellow guests: Jack Straw, Baroness Warsi, Chris Huhne and Bonnie Greer. ""So most of the panel are foreigners, chosen specifically to try to outface Nick Griffin – the only one who truly represents the oppressed and victimised indigenous folk of Britain,"" writes one supporter. None the less, there is something close to indignation on the website that the academic Bonnie Greer, a member of a ""non-native species"", will have the honour of sitting alongside their leader. ""Black history month belongs in black Africa & so does Ms Greer where she can teach her ancestral homeland their history,"" comments a white person. ""To my knowledge blacks have never contributed anything of major value to the world... & please don't mention slavery or we'll be here for an eternity."" It is a large part of his appeal to less sophisticated BNP members that Griffin has long understood the need to translate their thinking into something that sounds acceptable. In 2000, when he appeared at a meeting alongside the former Ku Klux Klan leader, David Duke, Griffin emphasised the importance of phrasing the BNP message in ""saleable words"". ""So instead of talking about racial purity,"" he explained, ""we talk about identity."" Today, this salesmanship works so well that, when interviewed, Griffin can be heard asserting that non-whites are inferior, without fear of confrontation. In an abject Radio One Newsbeat interview a few weeks ago, Griffin even remonstrated with his interviewer for bringing up immigration, the overriding concern of his party. ""I don't think ordinary listeners really are interested,"" he said, piously. So an ordinary listener might never have guessed that, back at base, his deputy was making roughly the opposite point: ""Whilst our children are being prostituted and our country being turned into an Islamic republic,"" blogged Simon Darby, ""BBC East Midlands, to its shame wishes to focus public attention on to mindless and emotive trivia."" After complaints about the Newsbeat interview, its editor, Rod McKenzie, insisted, rather alarmingly, that this protracted petting session had been ""rigorous"". ""We put to Nick Griffin some of the texts we received,"" he said, ""including sentiments as tough as 'you're a disgrace' and 'how do you sleep at night?'"" (Griffin said, politely, that he slept very well thank you). In any case, Mackenzie added, ""a great many texts we received yesterday were broadly supportive of the BNP"". Must have been that hypnotic wand again. David Dimbleby will do better this Thursday. His audience, too, is unlikely to put the question of Griffin's presumed insomnia before that of, say, proposed apartheid. But it is hard to understand why the panel for this particular Question Time is one that might have been picked by Cambridge-educated Griffin himself, had he wanted to illustrate his party's prime narrative: working class victimhood at the hands of an out-of-touch, liberal elite. Almost the best that can be said of any of the panellists is they are not Ben Bradshaw. Jack Straw, for all his anti-burqa credentials, should have been replaced by someone who has acknowledged the legitimate concerns of the white working class: Jon Cruddas. The Tories' Baroness Warsi, though she might seem a clever choice for the multiculturalism question, will merely be used by Griffin to highlight his own democratic mandate. Bonnie Greer, wonderful as she is, would be better on this occasion if she were Lenny Henry; and as for Huhn, he comes across – brilliantly for Griffin's outsider shtick – as a rich, establishment smoothy. Was no working-class non-racist available, anywhere? For supporters of free speech, it is obvious that the BNP, while it has legal, properly elected political representatives, should sometimes appear on the BBC. But for supporters of free speech, there is also the worry that if Griffin is allowed to get away with more play-acting on Question Time, the Hain argument for censorship will gather force. Thus, although there is no need for a genius to uncover the low truth behind Griffin's salesmanship, there is definitely a vacancy for a gifted comedian. Or four of them. Not only because the average comedian is apt to be more mentally agile than the average minister, they may even be more gifted performers. Names to have recently featured in domestic games of Fantasy BNP Question Time include Ian Hislop, Will Self, David Mitchell, Francis Wheen, Andy Hamilton, Frank Skinner and Sandi Toksvig. On this show, ridicule will be more effective than ratiocination, or abuse, or a supposedly shaming ""how do you sleep?"" in drawing out the implications of hating non-white people as a complete political philosophy. Though to be fair, the BNP say they'd also like to raise speed limits, bring back capital punishment and move to ""sustainable, organic farming"". Of indigenous vegetables only?

"George Osborne insists that repeated allusions, in his conference speech, to the much-loved High School Musical song, We're All in This Together, were inadvertent. If so, perhaps a powerful unconscious desire to emphasise the fresh and youthful aspects of his party explains an apparent fascination with Disney's teen phenomenon. We're All in This Together is certainly well chosen: a vibrant number that could have been written with the renewed Conservative party's inclusive message in mind. You will recall how the lyric continues: ""Everyone is special in their own way"" (a line that might have been written for Eric Pickles)… ""We're not the same, we're different in a good way."" For example, some of us, like George Osborne, are young. Others old. We might even be female, in a good way. As George put it, in a commendable channelling of the High School Musical vibe: ""Don't just follow the crowd or you will lend up lost."" But for all our tremendous diversity, the song reminds us: ""We're there for each other every time/Together come on let's do this right."" And doing it right, as young George announced last week, means: ""Our aim will be to bring forward the date when the pension age rises."" To much of his audience, already softened up for pension deferment by Lord Turner, his plan for retirement at 66 made perfect sense. Which of us is not familiar with appalling prognostications that depict a vast, yet tottery army of interminably demanding pensioners whose needs will bring the country to its knees? Moreover, it is often asserted, most modern older people are fit and raring to work into their seventies, particularly when increased life expectancy suggests that they may live to an age that makes that 122-year-old woman who used to sell paint to van Gogh look positively pubescent. Why stop work at 66 when, pretty soon, we're all going to be like Anne Robinson and live until we're 140, still looking gorgeous on Botox and relocated bottom fat? It is customary, at this point, to mention Viagra, B&Q, the astonishingly old undergraduate, Sir Oliver Popplewell, and his near contemporary, the pension-inventor Bismarck, who inquired, in 1883, when it was that people usually died. Hearing that it was 65, Bismarck selected that year as the perfect age to start providing benefits for unemployed Germans. Is it not mad, with average life expectancy now 79, that we should stick to arrangements prevalent during the era of the unification of Germany? Even if so many of the additional years of life we have been gifted are likely to be spent learning the truth of Philip Roth's recent observation: ""Old age is a massacre."" Nowadays, every increase in life expectancy can also be read as a more substantial increase in years of ill health. But the only year of retirement young Mr Osborne is interested in, of course, is the first, and healthiest one. In fact when they reach 66, what may worry his newly indentured drones as much as anything is the pervasive dislike of old people in an unashamedly ageist society. But perhaps this will change as we begin to recreate a world without retirement. Hasn't the BBC, leading the way, already launched a search for a presentable, middle-aged woman who is able to read? Although you are more likely to find Ming Campbell joining the Abercrombie & Fitch sales team these days before you see a venerable person anywhere near the stage at a political conference. God help any 66-year-old trying to break on to the front bench of the Conservative or Labour party: the average age in Brown's first cabinet was 49. Responding to Osborne's ""we're all in this together"" plan, campaigning groups have already pointed out that, although more affluent pensioners can escape drudgery, his ""we"" includes millions of workers for whom the basic state pension and benefits are everything. For 17% of single pensioners, and 7% of couples, this is their only source of income. For vast numbers – 45% of couples – it amounts to more than half their income. So, for as long the pension is denied, they may be stuck in hard, poorly paid jobs whose stressfulness far exceeds that of the ostensibly pressurised occupations our ageing professionals are so eager to keep. One thinks of Tony Blair, who could easily take early retirement but prefers to carry on with his performing work. But it's hard to know how many of these endlessly driven achievers there are. The most work-shy professionals may be slow to confess to indolence or even dwindling ambition in a culture where the prime attribute is to be hard working. Only losers, surely, admit that their work ethic is so weak they can't wait for permission to stop? For professionals who secretly endorse Philip Larkin's sentiments (""Why should I let the Toad work/squat on my life?""), there is at least the hope that young Osborne has not stolen much of their precious free time. (Larkin died at 63.) A clean-living librarian, for example, with a post-retirement life-expectancy of around 20 years, may be content to exchange a one-year Osborne detention for a significantly enhanced state pension. For an unskilled worker, however, from an area where people might expect to die 10 years earlier, probably after some years of ill health, the proposal is an unconscionable rip-off. Retirement at 66 is not just a lousy financial deal for impoverished pensioners, who get fewer years of state support in exchange for contributions paid over a working life, but Osborne's scheme could cheat them of a tenth of their retirement. He wants the best, irreplaceable year of what remains of their lives. Indignant fiftysomethings have already condemned Osborne's proposed breach of contract whereby as taxpayers they will be swindled out of a promised pay-out, but the loss of 12 months of longed-for leisure, after which the only certainty is physical decline, is surely the more serious theft. Time is to be taxed, along with income, but only if you're poor. You wonder, given Osborne's confident announcement of this outrageous wheeze, if he is even aware of the consequences for the non wallpaper-manufacturing classes. In the history of modest proposals, his plan to reharness pensioners to service debts run up by their leisured and longer-living betters is surely up there with Swift's edible babies. The difference in fortunes between Britain's richest and poorest, emotionally cited by Cameron in his appeal to the huddled masses, is nowhere more pitilessly displayed than in the contrasting lengths of their lives. At the last count, a professional man in the UK could expect to live, on average, eight years longer than his unskilled contemporary. Osborne could at least have acknowledged this when he proposed his scam, by suggesting that either pensionable age or pensions be linked to life expectancy. He chose not to. Because we're all in this together. Too bad that some of us will be together for quite a lot longer than others.","Will they still need us, will they still feed us when we're 66? | Catherine Bennett",2009-10-10T23:08:48Z,Catherine Bennett,politics
"Between the collapse of the Ceausescu regime in December 1989 and the spring of 1990, half a million indigenous so-called ""Saxons"" fled Romania for West Germany. It was the most astonishing, and little reported, ethnic migration in modern Europe. In the seven towns and 250 villages of Saxon Land in southern Transylvania, no less than 90% of the German-speaking population packed its bags and committed eight centuries of history to memory. They drove west to a country few of them knew, enticed by the notorious ""return to the fatherland"" speech of the German politician, Hans-Dietrich Genscher. The exodus left behind a deserted landscape the size of Wales, hundreds of square miles of rolling beech woods, bears, lush pastures and wild flowers, once home to the Dracula legend. Across it are dotted medieval grid-planned villages, with Lutheran churches, schools, dignified houses, barns and smallholdings, their customs and exclusivity reminiscent of the Pennsylvania Dutch. For 800 years since being invited by the Magyar kings to form a bulwark against the infidel, the Transylvania Saxons guarded their Germanic tradition. They spoke a High German said to be similar to ancient Luxembourgish. They embraced the Reformation and resisted Ceausescu's concrete communism. All this ended abruptly in 1990. While the people have almost all gone, the villages remain, colonised mostly by Romania'sbooming Gypsies. It is estimated that as many as a million may now occupy this part of Transylvania, possibly rendering it one day the only majority-Gypsy province. The result is the most exciting and daunting cultural challenge in Europe. The village of Archita is lost in a Carpathian valley near the 17th-century town of Sighisoara, whose medieval walls and nine towers lie at the heart of Dracula country. The village's fortified church stands like a castle in its midst, encircled by not one but two high walls, with musket holes and archers' galleries intact. It was built to protect the citizens against Tartar raids and still has its ham loft with hooks numbered for each house, an insurance against sudden siege. The interior displays its galleries, Protestant pulpit and baroque canopy. The churchyard is overgrown with unpicked plum and apple trees. From the rickety church tower the geometrical village plan reaches out into the surrounding woods. Wide streets and lime-washed, two-storeyed houses reflect the equal plots allotted to each Saxon family in the middle ages. Records show continuous family tenure from the 13th century to 1990. Just three Saxons remain. The 18th-century town hall and school of Archita have fallen into dereliction. Since the families employed few servants there are no poor houses or suburbs. There is no water or sewerage and no tarmac roads. The village well and a few desultory horses and carts are attended by attractive Gypsy youths. To the new inhabitants of these villages, the vanished Saxons represent an alien culture. But their ghosts flit round buildings that in most cases are unaltered since being converted from wood to stone in the 17th century. They are like the hill-station residences of British India, holding its genius loci in absentia.Ghosts linger too in the countryside round about, ironically preserved by Ceausescu's order forbidding development beyond the confines of existing settlement. This yielded one of the most effective green policies in Europe, protecting miles of meadow and forest, now vulnerable to exploitation. The roads are already littered with loggers carting away loads of walnut, beech and oak. Unesco has designated some of the Saxon churches as world heritage sites, as has the Romanian government, but not the villages. With no money for repairs and no enforcement, such designation carries little weight. There is thus a race to save the most endangered pre-industrial landscape in Europe from poverty-stricken newcomers understandably eager for modernity. One day these villages will be as treasured as those of the Cotswolds, Provence or Umbria, but until then they must pass through the valley of the shadow of possible death. The response of the outside world to Saxon Land's plight is uncertain. Money is seeping back. Some departed families have returned, some unhappy in exile, some as so-called ""summer Saxons"", holidaying in their former homeland and hoping to capitalise on rising property prices. I encountered one dedicated young German, Sebastian Bethge, in the dramatic hill village of Apold, labouring alone to restore the church interior with money raised in Berlin and elsewhere. A visiting pastor had just held a Lutheran service for a congregation of nine – four Romanians, three Hungarians and two Germans. The EU is bringing infrastructure to some villages, even as it devastates their markets for milk and hops. Unesco has its designations. The Transylvania Trust has restored the castle home of the novelist, Miklos Banffy, whose Transylvanian Trilogy is so evocative of this region's other, Hungarian, past. Britain's Prince of Wales has bought and restored two Saxon village houses. But most international effort goes on hands-clean ""awareness-raising"", on drawing up lists, holding conferences and restoring an occasional showcase palace. The most impressive venture is the London-based Mihai Eminescu Trust (Met), chiefly supported by the American Packard foundation. Its ""whole village"" concept is tailored to Saxon Land, yielding more than 600 projects in the past decade. A leading citizen is engaged in each village to glean what locals – now mostly Romanians and Gypsies – would like restored if money and expertise were available. This is exemplary conservation practice. Work is carried out by local contractors, with some 130 craftsmen trained to restore Lutheran and Orthodox churches, schools, houses and barns. Nothing is too small, from patched barn roofs and re-plastered street facades to empty properties converted to guesthouses. Plastic bus shelters and concrete bridges have been replaced in wood. A truly minimalist venture had a Gypsy in the village of Floresti asking for, and getting, a tiled roof over an appalling hovel shared with his wife, two horses and a mountain of manure. Virtually next door is a restored Evangelical church, its sun-bathed interior one of the most serene of any church I know. In the 13th-century village of Viscri, the Met has undertaken 160 restorations led by its local leader, Caroline Fernolend, winning it the EU's premier conservation award. Sewers were installed and a new kiln built to supply handmade tiles, operated by a local craftsman. The trust is even reinstating apple orchards and relaying a local narrow-gauge railway. No such conservation can work against the grain of local consent or in the absence of local skills. Imported from outside, it will stir resentment and obstruction. The root cause of the Saxons' exodus was starvation of the modern benefits of civilisation. These cannot be denied their successors. Yet the conservation of town and village cultures across the sweep of Europe proves that ancient and modern can co-exist to the advantage of both. Such is the disregard of the past by other world continents that these survivors will one day be respected, valued and celebrated. The Transylvanian Saxons ranked with the Mennonite Amish, the Patagonia Welsh and the Volga Germans among the dislocated tribes of Europe. They lasted a phenomenal eight centuries, leaving intact monuments of a culture distinct and yet integral to European history. If modern European union cannot guard such relics of its diversity it is not worth the name.",A forgotten Saxon world shows how ancient and modern can co-exist  | Simon Jenkins,2009-10-01T19:30:00Z,Simon Jenkins,world
"People will be furious about cuts to public services and will react either by going private – as with the care of elderly people – or by going local. In parts of Wales, rage has overturned plans for cuts in schools and hospitals. Which is it likely to be? An iron law of bureaucracy holds that when resources are increasing, those devoted to administration rise faster than those allocated to the frontline. When resources are cut, the opposite applies. Can this law be defied? The only way to protect the frontline will be somehow to take swaths of recently expanded administration out of the system. Given the difficulty the British government has found in slimming down its bureaucracy, over decades of trying, it is probable that the only way to remove large costs is by removing whole tiers of supervision and control – in Whitehall, among supervisory quangos, and in regional offices of central government. Figures are hard to come by, but this tier of public administration has probably risen by double or treble frontline expansion in services such as health, education and policing. There is massive fat in the system, well illustrated by the recent announcement by the children's secretary, Ed Balls, that he could take £2bn out of the school service with no less teaching. In conditions of austerity, the focus of attention will shift towards the way in which public services are delivered at the point of contact with the public. There is no sign of any diminution in demand. The public will press local councils and health and police authorities to deliver. The result will be to energise local channels of accountability. Committees, even parties, will form to save a hospital, school or police station. As central resources dry up, the pressure will increase to supply local solutions. Already, councils such as Barnet and Hammersmith and Fulham in London are cutting their own bureaucracy. The concept of ""easyCouncil"" will spread. Most public services are still delivered locally. Across most of Europe, the local tier would take much of the pressure at a time of cuts. There is not the battery of targets, from 60 to 600 according to taste, and the battery of monitoring and enforcement agencies suffered by local administration in Britain. In addition, local voters would enjoy a measure of choice in how far they want to cushion themselves against cuts, by deciding how much to tax-and-spend for themselves. This is not a matter of rich v poor. Every regime, including Britain, has tax equalisation schemes in place. It is a matter of choice. This will mean a change in the perception of public services and a change within the professions themselves. The centralisation that has characterised British public administration since the second world war will go into reverse, with people expecting more from their local council, be it parish, district, municipality or county. The service ""silos"" working to vertical lines of accountability to Whitehall will erode - despite protests over post-code lotteries. Greater freedom to local councils to raise and spend money will encourage them to seek across-the-board solutions to such community ailments as youth gangs, late-night drunkenness or run-down housing estates. Social workers will spend more time answering to community councils, rebelling against the targets and paperwork that will continue to cascade from above. A help to this should be the Tories' promised ending of regional government, removing a tier of intervention in the hierarchy. The Home Office recently pledged to cut a swath of paperwork required of the police. The same could be applied to the ""wheelbarrows"" of directives still sent out to local education and health services. With localisation should come an advance of voluntarism. The past half century has seen a widespread replacement of volunteers with paid staff in large areas of public service, such as youth work and the care of old people. Despite union opposition, cuts should lead to a return to the voluntary principle. In addition, public services should show they are moving to the 80/20 split of frontline to overhead spending that is the charity sector benchmark. This will require a specific reduction – phenomenally hard to achieve – in the burden of inspection and regulatory overhead. Any cut in resources to a service should carry a specific, audited reduction in regulatory load. A slimmer and more local framework should bring a return to a more self-reliant and responsible group of public service professionals. A recent trend in the job of ""civil servant"" has been a move from personal discretion towards delivering to measureable targets, fixed by superior tiers of government and outside consultants. Under cuts, professionals will be forced back on their own judgment, forced to form their own priorities and defend them to local people. They will become more risk-taking, more responsible, more accountable and probably more disobedient. It is a silver lining on the forthcoming cloud.",Cuts to public services will result in risk-taking and rebellion | Simon Jenkins,2009-09-29T18:40:01Z,Simon Jenkins,society
"There are now so many Neets that it's hard to believe the acronym has only been around since 1999, when it was deployed by New Labour's Geoff Mulgan to describe people ""Not in Education, Employment or Training"". In fact, credit where it's due, his versatile coinage may turn out to be one of the few lastingly useful achievements of the Blair era. The word has not only entered the English language but travelled as far as Japan, where as ""niito"" it apparently designates affluent as well as impoverished non job-seekers. Along the way, both the number of British Neets and their definition have also expanded: there are now 959,000, many of them older than the 15-19-year-olds, whose sorry prospects and ruinous expense to taxpayers were initially identified by Mulgan. Take Charles, aged 61. Based in rural Gloucestershire, he is married for the second time, with two grown-up children, both serving in the forces. Not a classic Neet perhaps, yet he, too, is not in education, employment or training, nor dependent upon a partner. His wife, Camilla, lacks any formal education and has never had a job. Charles is proud to do some unpaid work while he benefits from preferential tax arrangements, but such activity does not (as some voluntary organisations have complained) exclude altruistic Neets from membership of what is, perhaps, Britain's most burdensome demographic group. Friends worry about the prospects for Charles, who has been in this aimless state since he left the armed forces 33 years ago, at the age of 28, saying he was determined to ""be more useful"". His biographer, Jonathan Dimbleby, has detailed the young Charles's search for a fulfilling purpose. ""My great problem in life is that I do not really know what my role in life is,"" he once said, in a speech at Cambridge University. ""At the moment I do not have one. But somehow I must find one."" By the time he was 30, this persistent lack of direction was taking its toll on Charles's morale, in ways that the Neet authorities today will recognise all too well. There was anxiety, a sense of inferiority, frustration, misdirected anger. Not even the slowly advancing prospect of sovereignty could prevent a noticeable decline in Charles's spirits. ""Easily provoked by minor irritations,"" wrote Dimbleby about this period, ""he became uncharacteristically impatient and peremptory."" The smallest things would prompt verbal abuse or ""sudden outbursts of rage"". Sport and activity failed to help. ""The rush from one engagement to another,"" Dimbleby wrote, ""concealed a vacuum from which he recoiled almost in despair."" And this, remember, was before Charles's attempts to participate in professions for which, being a Neet, he was unqualified only stigmatised him further, as a social menace. Long, thickly underlined letters in which he would bombard government officials with advice only reminded their recipients that they would rather he did nothing. Today, he is more likely to throw himself into planning matters, to the irritation of internationally famous architects and, more important, of his future subjects. Just last week, for example, an article in which the prince urged planners to reduce car use reminded readers that he is the owner of two Jaguars, two Audis, a Range Rover and an Aston Martin. Since Neetness is known to be common in families where there has been no experience of work for generations, it is perhaps predictable that we find a number of Charles's close relations who answer the same description. His aunt Margaret – famously lazy, ill-natured and uneducated – met a sad end. Of his two brothers, Andrew at least appears untroubled by many years of dependency and squanders public funds with energy (his two daughters are predicted to acquire permanent Neet status within the next two or three years). Of the younger brother, Edward, little has been heard since he gave up his job in 2002, ostensibly to help with his mother's golden jubilee. He is thought to be living on her charity. In the next generation, Charles's older son, William, is already showing typical signs of Neet-related distress. Though the prince is still gainfully employed as an RAF flight lieutenant, the job is unlikely to continue for much longer, after which the prospect of a vacuum is something of which this presentable 27-year-old already appears to have become aware. Last week, he declared that he did not want to just be ""an ornament"". To suggest that, in that case, he finds a proper career may be to underestimate this demographic's difficulties with alienation and emotional intelligence. Consider that the biggest influence on William has been a self-pitying, occasionally infantile father who was, prior to that, a miserable child who felt neglected by his parents. He worshipped his grandmother, who combined lifelong Neet status with defiant extravagance. Speaking at a charities forum, Prince William added that, in order to avoid ornamentation, he planned to develop his philanthropic work. Like his father, who began the Prince's Trust at around the same age, William may find that working with fellow Neets helps with his morale. He experienced a boost recently, when climbing Helvellyn with young homeless people. ""I get an awful lot out of it when it works,"" he said. But will this be enough to sustain him through what might become three or four decades of unemployment? Particularly when most of his free time is spent with current or future Neets, such as his girlfriend, Kate Middleton? She gave up her job two years ago, aged 25, and is now thought to be dependent on her parents. The inventor of Neets, Geoff Mulgan, has emphasised the importance of at-risk children being encouraged to realise that ""you could be much more than perhaps your parents ever were"". Is Prince William aware that, notwithstanding what might appear to be his destiny, he could still escape the royal scrapheap? Given that a case like his is unlikely to respond to the usual incentives, such as free iPods and £30 bribes, a multi-agency response must attempt, for all our sakes, to expand the young man's horizons. You probably can't judge a civilisation by the way it treats its princes, but that principle certainly extends to its Neets. Or ornaments, as they would no doubt prefer to be known.",In princes we trust ... to do absolutely nothing useful | Catherine Bennett,2009-09-26T23:07:53Z,Catherine Bennett,uk
"In the 1980 film The Shining, how can anyone not be touched by Jack Nicholson's sensitive portrayal of a man being possessed by evil and turning into a murdering psychopath? As he takes an axe to the door separating him from his cowering wife, Shelley Duval, he flashes his vulpine grin and snarls: ""Here's Johnny"" and your heart melts. Was he compelled to kill by the cabin-fever hell of being holed up in a remote hotel in which he had taken winter refuge for the purposes of finishing his book? Or was he possessed by the spirit of a previous caretaker who had been driven to slaughter his entire family? I thought of Jack last week when I completed my application to become the manager of a tearoom on the island of Canna, the westernmost outcrop of the Inner Hebrides. The post has just been advertised, but will attract the usual assortment of time-wasters and mountebanks. Only 17 people reside there and the tearoom only really does business in the summer when passengers disembark from CalMac ferries for sightseeing. It is a spot of heartbreaking natural beauty and scenic grandeur. I've taken the unusual and possibly inappropriate step of publicising my job application simply because I believe I am the only man for the job and that the islanders deserve to know this. The National Trust for Scotland states that only persons with previous catering experience need apply, but I think they'll overlook the absence of such on my CV when they discover what else I can bring to the job. And anyway, there's an abundance of fish around the island and once I've harvested my potato crop it'll be fish suppers all round. And, in the style of authentic Highland hospitality, food would only be served from 12.45 to 2pm and thereafter only at my discretion. The first thing I would do is apply for a late drinking licence for the tearoom and put a jukebox and a cigarette machine in the place. Thus, I would be doing my bit for community relations. This is important, because we all know how islanders can get self-absorbed and blow things out of proportion because of all that emptiness. So instead of sitting on a solitary rock peering intensely into a moody sky and smouldering at the spitefulness of Roddy and Calum, they can come away in to my place and settle things over a late-night swalette. I've always had an interest in Scottish islands ever since my parents took me to Millport. Since then, I've broadened my knowledge with memorable visits to Mull and Arran. Not to mention the wee archipelago that sits in the middle of Hogganfield Loch in Glasgow's leafy north-east suburbs. Previously, I'd only ever been happiest when operating in a big-city environment. If there's a busy wine bar with lots of opinionated Glaswegians within walking distance of a taxi rank or if there's the promise, at the end of a week, of raucous carousing at a sweaty football match, then I'm your man. Recently though, my heart has yearned for wide open spaces and solitude, for sea air and rolling hills. Canna therefore is for me. In the last few months, I've been up a couple of Munros and so know a lot about the countryside code. I know not to leave empty cans in fields and gardens, although the deep emerald green of an El Dorado wine bottle can often enhance a forest floor's verdant beauty. There are hundreds of livestock on Canna that need to be looked after. You name it: cows, sheep, goats… all sorts of rural beasts. Me and animals, though, go back a long way. I had about two dogs when I was growing up and, when climbing the Campsies, was never anything less than polite to the cows. And, somehow, I just know I would be a natural at milking them if required to do so by the island's milking maids on their wooden three-legged stools. I also love bird life and, as there are golden eagles, great skuas and puffins in abundance, I'd have a ball. I used to collect birds' eggs to help in my school biology studies. Being the Highlands, I'm sure everyone will be right into their Free Presbyterianism and will have to take turns at the mending of ways and the damnation. But even though I'm a mere Roman, I have read a few Bible passages and know a couple of the psalms and I also know John MacLeod, the great Scottish writer and the greatest living Free Presbyterian. He could give me a safe conduct note just in case… Most important, I'm quite a sociable chap and would get on well with all the islanders. Indeed, I could be a source of solace when they get all melancholy as the nights draw in and they sing their lilting songs about the weather and the fishermen. I also have a kilt and am about to take Gaelic lessons. I am, though, aware of the physical privations that an incomer must endure when an island winter bites and that life can then become a fragile thing. So if anything happens to me during my five-year term I've donated all of my organs for medical research. If they are deemed unsuitable owing to my failure to give them due care and attention, then they can use pictures of them for those scary warnings they put on the back of cigarette packets.","Oh, it's the island life and a cuppa for me | Kevin McKenna",2009-09-26T23:06:57Z,Kevin McKenna,uk
"There was something wrong with that picture. Of course all the best politicians are skilled actors, so they did their best to hide the reality. But, despite the smiles and the handshake, Barack Obama, Mahmoud Abbas and Binyamin Netanyahu could not quite conceal the weirdness at the centre of their photo-op in New York today. What the image should have conveyed was the gratitude of the leaders of two minor states, happy to be basking in the sunlight radiated by the global emperor. Instead they looked sullen and reluctant, as if they had done Obama, leader of the world's sole superpower, a favour by turning up. How had it come about that, in the words of the Israeli columnist Nahum Barnea, the Americans had ""discovered that they want an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement more than the Israelis and the Palestinians want it""? The narrow answer is the usual one, that the local politics on both sides of the conflict has made inaction a safer bet than action. Netanyahu sits atop a coalition that is perfectly stable – just so long as he doesn't do anything. Were he so much as to hint at taking any of the steps necessary for a peace deal, coalition partners would start breaking off like aeroplane wings in an ice storm. As for Abbas, he has finally acquired some political strength, removing potential rivals from within his own Fatah faction while all trace of Hamas has been eradicated from the West Bank. As one Fatah insider puts it: ""Abbas is now at the peak of his powers."" All that could damage him are the accusations of treachery that would instantly follow any compromise with Israel. So Netanyahu and Abbas had something in common: neither wanted to meet the other. Abbas didn't want to break his earlier pledge that he would only start talking if Israel agreed to a complete freeze on settlement building. And Netanyahu refused to agree to any such freeze. In the end they came to the Waldorf only because Obama deployed the one weapon no Israeli or Palestinian leader can resist: a direct invitation from the American president. The gloomy conclusion to draw from this diplomatic dance – a routine whose key step has been footdragging – is that Barack Obama is a diminished figure in the Middle East, and perhaps around the world. Having been inaugurated after a landslide victory that gave him the heftiest stock of political capital in a generation, Obama no longer seems to command the fear, or even the respect, that is a basic tool of the job. Scan the Arab or Israeli press of recent days and you see commentators queueing up to brand Obama as a weak naif who got suckered. On the Arab side, he demanded a few gestures of normalisation towards Israel – overflight rights for El Al jets and looser rules on tourist visas, for example – from the so-called moderate states and got next to nothing. Humiliation came in June when he went to Saudi Arabia only for the king to say no to his face. With the Israelis he fared no better. He issued a demand that could not be nuanced or fudged: he wanted a total halt to settlement construction. No ifs or buts. Bibi has revelled in his refusal, the Israeli public and press applauding as he shows the US president the finger. Barnea called the New York meeting a ""joke at the expense of Barack Obama, who took one look at Middle East politics and got burned"". Even Obama's friends worry that he has lost face in a region where face matters, his authority further weakened by the sight of him struggling to get his way on domestic policy at home. Veterans of the peace process on both sides agree that the key mistake was the demand to freeze settlements. Every US administration has called for a halt – some more sincerely than others – and none have ever got their way. Obama might have proved the exception had he been prepared to escalate his standoff with Bibi, to increase the pressure once Israel's first answer was no. But he was not. Menachem Klein, a scholar and adviser to the Israeli delegation during the Camp David peace talks of 2000, reckons the settlements gambit might have worked had it been framed differently. Obama could have called not for a freeze of all settlements – including those regarded by many Israelis as glorified suburbs of Jerusalem – but for the dismantling of the more egregious ones, those far-flung towns and villages that no one believes will remain under Israeli sovereignty in a plausible peace deal. Next, Obama could have offered a quid pro quo, centred on assurances on security. That way, says Klein, Obama would have overcome the resistance of those Israelis ""who have been asking why they should give up something for nothing"". The president would have separated the Israeli mainstream from the ideological hardcore of settlers. Instead they have been united – behind Netanyahu. Plenty of Obama critics have seized upon this first setback as evidence that the president is in over his head on foreign policy. A failing strategy in Afghanistan, rejection of his outstretched hand to Iran, ""capitulation"" on missile defence to Russia – all make it on to the anti-Obama charge sheet. It makes a neat thesis but it is, at the very least, premature. Obama's achievement yesterday was modest, but it was not nothing. In the end, both Netanyahu and Abbas had to bend to his will. They heard him insist that Middle East peace is a national security interest of the US, signalling that it will remain a personal priority. By announcing that Hillary Clinton – rather than just his envoy, George Mitchell – will report back to him in mid-October, he has ratcheted up the engagement a notch. He also put the parties on notice that he knows the old games, and will not tolerate them. ""We cannot continue the same pattern of tentative steps forward and then stepping back,"" he said. It's worth remembering too that Netanyahu has had to budge once already this year, by publicly accepting a Palestinian state – albeit one qualified beyond recognition – and that the ground has now been laid for the next phase. Both sides now have a clear idea of what will be required of them. Above all, those panicking that Obama has not yet bagged a clutch of foreign policy triumphs in the Middle East and elsewhere may be forgetting both the mess that he inherited and his leadership style. He plays the long, slow game, advancing gradually. So, yes, there was no overnight fix in New York, but that was never on the cards. Besides, Obama believes he has time on his side. Unlike most US presidents keen to play Middle East peacemaker, he has not tackled this in his last year, but in his first. I'm not sure which view – the ever-shrinking Obama whose credibility is eroding fast, or the careful tortoise who will eventually overtake the hare – is right. It's too early to tell. But either way, Obama needs to shake off that first perception before it congeals. In the Middle East that means pressing the reset button. He could do that with a long overdue direct address to the Israeli people: dispelling the absurd myths that say he is an Arab Muslim congenitally hostile to their country. At the same time, he needs to find a new way to show the Palestinians he can deliver. These are still early days in the presidency of Barack Obama: we must hope that, as with his life story, the first act provides little clue for what comes next.","Obama may have lost some face in the Middle East, but don't write him off yet | Jonathan Freedland",2009-09-22T19:11:44Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"If even the revelation that she'd been raped couldn't do it, one wonders if there is any situation that could lead to people feeling sympathy for Katie Price? Or is the mood against her so far gone that a plane could fall out of the sky, right on top of her head, and there would still be members of the British media and public muttering: ""Well, she deserved it, didn't she? Publicity-seeking trollop. Look at how she treated Peter Andre!"" Something has to explain the bizarre attitude of some parts of the media regarding Price's account of being assaulted. Always careful to toss in a caveat (""Anyone who's been raped deserves sympathy""), too often this would segue into a (surely irrelevant?) diatribe about Price's character and behaviour, followed by baiting over her refusal to involve the police. Irresponsible, if not downright suspicious, seemed to run the rationale. Well, not really. If anything, with her fear of involving the police and the courts, Price was behaving like a typical rape victim. Doesn't this, the omnipresent culture of automatic disbelief around sexual assault, serve to highlight why Price, and many other victims of rape, are so loath to come forward? Indeed, doesn't Price's obvious lack of faith in the legal system mirror the torment of many other rape victims, ordinary women, who fear they have little chance of being believed? Not that Price has done herself many PR favours lately: not by announcing the rape in OK! magazine, talking about it (or ""not talking about it"") on Matthew Wright's show (echoing Ulrikagate), nor even by spending so much time gyrating around the clubs of Ibiza, like some trashed Essex Barbarella. Then again, who among us, post-split, manages to pull off the full (classy, composed) ""Audrey Hepburn""? In my opinion, there has been more humanity and honesty in Price's raddled clubbing than (again, only my opinion, libel team) the passive-aggressive simpering of Andre, last seen on Jonathan Ross on Friday night, puffing out his over-developed abs, like some mutant Toblerone. All of which would (should) be irrelevant, except in the matter of Price's credibility about her rape, it sadly isn't. Indeed, the case against her (the incessant baiting to name names and involve the police) seems to rest almost entirely on widespread censure of her general deportment. In recent days, I have even seen comments on websites along the lines of ""even if she was raped"" looking she does, behaving like she does: ""Is it any real surprise?"" And just like that, we are back in the bad old days of eye-rolling police, censorious judges, of women being more or less told they had brought sexual assault on themselves with their swigging of Babychams and wriggling in miniskirts; that, all things considered: ""Darling, you asked for it."" All of which leads one to the conclusion that Price was absolutely right not to press charges. Not only did the incident occur so long ago it would be impossible to prove, but she would have had her character and sexual history trashed, the whole process most probably resulting in a failed court case and ersatz ""proof"" that she'd ""lied"". Basically, as seems rather too routine with rape cases, Price would have ended up a victim twice. In this way, Price's refusal to prosecute her alleged attacker is not just her being gobby ""Jordan"", irresponsibly shooting her mouth off for attention, and then backtracking when the heat turns up. On the contrary, by being scared and withdrawing Price has revealed herself as an Everywoman – as in, every woman who has ever been raped but does not press charges because deep down she fears she will not be believed. These Columbine fantasists owe us a big apology Matthew Swift, 18, and Ross McKnight, 16, from Denton, Manchester, have been acquitted of plotting to blow up schools and shopping centres to mark the 10th anniversary of the Columbine school massacre. One of the defence team says the case was a farcical over-reaction and a waste of police time and public money. For all their blather, the boys had accumulated no guns or explosives, and their fantasising was merely teenage angst, in Swift's words, ""a fantasy, not a reality"". McKnight added that he'd been forced to take his GCSEs in custody. Diddums. Just because Swift and McKnight were found not guilty it doesn't mean that their ""fantasies"" about blowing up public places and shooting all survivors weren't alarming. It is also unfair to suggest that the authorities had any option but to take it seriously. For all they knew, they may have had a real-life version of Lionel Shriver's novel We Need to Talk About Kevin on their hands. What if they had ignored Swift and McKnight, dismissed it as a teenage wind-up and then something had happened? Would they then have been blamed for a farcical under-reaction? Although not guilty, arguably certain aspects of the boys' behaviour (planning, preening) fitted the profile of this kind of massacre, which, with real killers, tips over into a narcissistic desire to be noticed, to reap attention via fear and awe. It's a phenomenon related best in the song The Nobodies by rock performer Marilyn Manson, who may lurch around looking like a Halloween costume left to melt on the radiator, but whose music was blamed by the US right for inciting Columbine, so he's probably entitled to have an opinion about it. As for teenage angst and fantasising, perhaps Swift and McKnight should get with the rest of the male teens in the country and content themselves with developing a painful crush on Cheryl Cole. Indeed, although The X Factor contestants are routinely derided for their crazy wannabe dreams about superstardom, next to what certain other teenagers are fantasising about, they suddenly look the pinnacle of good mental health. Although Swift and McKnight's plotting turned out not to be genuine, it was still vile, disturbing and required thorough investigation. They should be apologising for any police time and public money wasted, not the other way around. Let's hear it for Jo and the rock chicks So Strictly Come Dancing is back.

The Wood saga highlights the reality of that much-maligned social group – rock wives. Dismissed as feckless floozies, in truth, they work horribly hard, keeping their muso-miseries' tummies filled, inappropriately ""young"" clothes washed and egos stroked, not to mention fending off endless Ekaterinas.

"Anyone who cares about the survival of our planet should start praying that Barack Obama gets his way on reforming US healthcare. That probably sounds hyperbolic, if not mildly deranged: even those who are adamant that 45 million uninsured Americans deserve basic medical cover would not claim that the future of the earth depends on it. But think again. Next week, world leaders will attend the first UN summit dedicated entirely to climate change. Their aim will be to plunge a shot of adrenaline into stuttering efforts to draw up a new global agreement on carbon emissions. The plan is to replace the Kyoto treaty with a new one, to be agreed in Copenhagen in December. Trouble is, the prospects of getting a deal worthy of the name get bleaker every day. Few deny that the world needs a new agreement. In the 12 years since Kyoto, we've emitted a whole lot more carbon – and gained a whole lot more knowledge of its dangers. The science is now clear that if we do not manage to keep the increase in the earth's temperature below 2C, we risk facing the effects of catastrophic climate change – with all the flooding, drought, mass migration and human suffering that it would entail. The experts tell us that the only way to stay below that 2C limit is for global emissions to peak in 2015 – and then start falling. In other words, we have set ourselves up at a nice corner table in the last chance saloon. Copenhagen is that last chance. If successful, it could see rich countries promise not only to cut their emissions but to stump up cash for poor nations to pay for the changes they'll need to protect their towns and villages from those effects of climate change already under way and too late to reverse (think houses on stilts on easily flooded sandbanks in Bangladesh). Developing countries would not have to cut their own emissions right away, but they would have to plan now for a low-carbon future, one consistent with keeping the planet below that two-degree mark. A new Copenhagen treaty would lead us to the day when our worldwide emissions peak – and then start coming down. We would at last be reversing the tide that threatens to engulf our planet. If that's the prize, there are the most enormous obstacles in its path. A single text would have to be acceptable to rich and poor nations, democratic and not, left and right, binding them not just for now but for decades hence. As the Guardian reports today, even the developed countries of the west cannot agree among themselves how carbon emissions should be counted, let alone reduced. What's more, elected leaders will have to be sure that whatever they sign at Copenhagen will be accepted back home. Which brings us to Obama. Last November, the sigh of relief among greens and diplomats could be heard around the world. While George Bush had ripped up Kyoto, Obama would surely lead the way to Copenhagen. Now that early confidence is fading. Those same diplomats and negotiators have seen the president struggle to make what, to outsiders, look like pretty reasonable changes to US healthcare. They have seen a summer campaign demonise him as an amalgam of Stalin, Hitler and Big Brother, bent on sending America's frail grannies to their deaths in the name of a new socialism. If that's the response he gets when he suggests Americans should be covered even when they change jobs or get sick, imagine the monstering coming his way if he tells his compatriots they have to start cutting back on the 19 tonnes of CO2 each one of them emits per year (more than twice the amount belched out by the average Brit). Even if he was prepared to defy US public opinion, Congress wouldn't let him. Remember, it was not Bush who killed the Kyoto treaty in the US. The Senate rejected it before the text had even been finalised, by a margin of 95 votes to none. Once again, if Obama cannot even get his healthcare reform through a Democratic-controlled senate, what chance a climate change treaty that goes beyond Kyoto? One European diplomat closely involved with the talks despairs at the ""Republican headbangers who cannot resist a chance to damage Obama, believe global warming is based on junk science and regard action on climate change as ungodly because it will delay the second coming"". Unsurprisingly, this is having an immediate effect on the morale of everyone else involved in Copenhagen. Some negotiators worry that the urgency is being drained from the process: why bust a gut to make a December deadline for a document that's only going to end up either diluted or in the Capitol Hill shredder? Others worry that those countries already looking to delay the moment of truth will be only too happy to use Obama as their excuse. Bush may have gone, but the United States still makes a handy scapegoat in plenty of European capitals. The greatest concern is over the Chinese. They start out sceptical, wondering why developing countries should do anything to clear up a mess created by the rich ones. Wave the stats that say 90% of the growth in future emissions will be from the developing world, and their response is direct: they will do nothing that will slow down their own economic growth. Add to that the prospect that the US might not, after all, be ready to pull its weight and the Chinese enthusiasm for sacrifice shrinks still further. ""After you,"" they seem to be saying to the west. Their current position is that their emissions will not start falling until 2030: the science suggests that, for the world to have a hope, that date is just too late. So is the world about to blow its last chance to avoid catastrophe? Yesterday I visited the Department of Energy and Climate Change – where a Countdown to Copenhagen clock greets visitors in the lobby – to talk to Ed Miliband. If he is feeling pessimistic, he did his best to hide it. He concedes that the current talks are ""hanging in the balance"" but argues that even if some omens are troubling, the stars will never again be in such favourable alignment. A first-term US president who believes global warming is real is matched by a Chinese leadership that, whatever its wariness of international agreements, does now believe climate change is a real threat to its own safety. Miliband is confident that, so long as the Chinese come to see low carbon as an opportunity – to make green-tech products they can then sell to the world – and so long as US opinion can be brought around, a deal is within reach. But these are enormous ifs, especially the latter one. It's good to hear that Al Gore and John Kerry are hard at work, organising outside and inside the Senate, but as the healthcare debacle shows, shifting US attitudes is a daunting task. What's needed is for US campaigners to step up their efforts, starting now, and not letting up for three months: no sleep till Copenhagen. Their mission must be to build the public support for action on climate change that might act as a counterweight to those ""Republican headbangers"" and give Obama the space to act. Not for the first time, the fate of the world rests in the hands of US domestic politics. As it did a year ago, autumn begins with the world watching the Americans, holding its breath that they will do the right thing.","If Obama can't defeat the Republican headbangers, our planet is doomed | Jonathan Freedland",2009-09-15T21:00:02Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"I thought I was witnessing Govan's next superstar on a Renfrewshire football pitch 10 years ago. He could only have been nine and the ball was a precious thing to him as he cajoled it away from throngs of opposition players; sometimes with his left foot, sometimes with his right. He was the quickest player on the pitch, yet didn't seem to be expending any more energy than the hapless others. And he had a sinewy physical strength that allowed him to negotiate tackles that began to grow more raw and industrial as the game reached its conclusion. Yet it wasn't one of these ever more reckless tackles that was to bring him down, but the thuggish intervention of one of his own coaches after he had missed a chance. ""You should have passed the feckin' ball, ya greedy wee bastard."" This refrain was taken up with gusto by an assortment of gargoyles and knuckle-draggers lining the side of the park. Some of them were coaches and some the fathers of other children, doubtless jealous of this chosen one's ability and his place in the team. His confidence shattered and with tears stinging his eyes, he was hauled off a few minutes before the end as ""a lesson"". He was the latest child victim of a ritual humiliation that takes place most Saturdays in football pitches where children play all over west central Scotland. Go down to any of these parks and you'll hear the sound of sheer joy as young boys and girls exult in the experience of wearing their local team's football top for the first time. The pride of belonging and of being wanted in this most revered of Scottish pastimes cannot be equalled in the soul of a youth. It is a sacred rite of passage that can define a childhood. But listen more and interspersed with the cries of the innocent you will hear something ugly and brutal: the rancid howl of west of Scotland adult male culture trying to impose its cynicism, disappointment and failure on to another generation. As you approach these miniature pitches, you always wonder if you may be privileged to be granted a glimpse of a new Jimmy Johnstone, but you know your senses will be assaulted with banks and banks of raging and foul-mouthed little Rumpelstiltskins jumping up and down on the touchlines roaring: ""Pass! Tackle! Get right intae him!"" And you want to grab these village idiots and tell them to be quiet and to give the children the ball and let them play. You also begin to realise why at least 16 years will have elapsed before Scotland get a chance to play in another World Cup final series. For how many potentially gifted young footballers have had their physical and emotional development stunted and scarred by the lumpen endeavours of those who have been awarded coaching certificates? At Hampden Park last Wednesday, another Scotland qualifying campaign shuddered to a halt when the national team was beaten 1-0 by Holland. Despite the defeat, there were traces of gallantry, heroism and even skill. But the Dutch, superior in every part of the game, would always have won. Four days previously, the Scots had beaten Macedonia to enkindle hopes of unlikely qualification, yet amid the euphoria of a rare victory, one aspect of the game was largely forgotten: that Macedonia were desperately unlucky to lose and had been much better than Scotland in basic techniques such as quick passing, running into space and being comfortable on the ball. At times, it was embarrassing to watch. Scotland last took part in a World Cup in 1998 and their next opportunity will not arrive until 2014. This is a national humiliation and ought to be a matter of deep concern for the entire nation, no matter how many of our fellow citizens are uninterested in football. Since 1994, the World Cup has become the greatest sporting, cultural and economic extravaganza on the planet. The finances of small nations can be set on a sound footing with participation in this event while the value of marketing the country for four weeks of intense scrutiny in front of the world's biggest viewing audience is incalculable. It is now too important for a country such as Scotland to miss for a generation – for football defines Scotland. It is a global phenomenon that since the late 19th century we helped to develop and modernise and we should be proud of the massive part we have played in its global popularity. The Scottish Football Association has failed in all of its core objectives for more than 10 years now. Lamely, the SFA and its placemen will tell us that Scotland just doesn't produce the raw talent any more. This is a lie. Has there been a genetic defect in all Scottish babies born since 1980, not evident in the offspring of other countries, which will prevent them from passing a football accurately and being comfortable striking it with either foot? The continual failure of our nation at world football is of critical importance to the country and must become a political imperative. The government must summon the senior office bearers of our main football bodies to account for their failures over the last decade and demand plans for the next five. Forget Henry McLeish's fledgling SFA-backed thinktank, we need a root and branch review into the quality of our coaches. Scotland does still produce potentially great players, but their skills are being choked in a coaching landscape echoing to the dull threats of the touchline Wullies and Boabs.",Scotland's ritual slaughter of its footballing hopes | Kevin McKenna,2009-09-12T23:07:14Z,Kevin McKenna,uk
"Letters addressed to the whole population rarely bring good news. The last I received, I think, was about the transmission of swine flu. The one before that was a much-treasured personal note from a man called Dave, apologising for having lost all the child benefit records. What a change, then, to hear from Sir Michael Lyons of the BBC Trust, who has no disasters to report in an open letter that begins: ""Dear licence payer."" He wishes only to tell us how much we all already love the BBC, and how his Corporation is thinking up ways that will make us love it, and the licence fee, even more. It's going to embark on a new report. Though the ""yours truly"" sign-off is a nice touch, I wonder how many of his readers will get to the end. Unlike the swine flu leaflet, he doesn't half go on. Who can forget ""catch it, bin it, kill it""? Lyons's letter, whose message amounts to ""keep, it keep it, keep it"" is more than 1,300 words long. It's unbelievably boring. It's irritating. Quite a lot of it is drivel: ""We want a BBC that is smarter, more efficient and no bigger than it needs to be."" What? Nicolas Sarkozy is probably no bigger than he needs to be, but still believes himself to be on the small side. For rather a lot of Mike's correspondents, I suspect (and what sort of knighted twerp signs himself ""Sir"" other than the thespian majesty that is Ben Kingsley?), this letter will simply remind them why they often feel so exasperated by the BBC. In some cases, it will merely prompt the usual, reflexive response when the Corporation does something stupid: what a waste of licence-payers' money. Admittedly, the letter probably didn't take that long to produce or, rather, to hone down from Mick's initial draft of, I imagine, some 25,000 words. But even so. What a waste of time. And how about the coincidence of this paternalist tripe appearing on the same day the BBC announces that it is going to move the extraordinarily popular Strictly Come Dancing to a slot where, set against the also extraordinarily popular ITV show, The X Factor, it will screw up the televisual enjoyment of everyone who likes both these reality talent shows? Short of replacing Strictly's Bruce Forsyth with Esther Rantzen, could the BBC have gone any further to make itself unpopular? Would any sensible business operation have pushed loyal customers into a position where they are encouraged to do without its own product? Is that why we pay the licence fee? This may not be the most subtle reaction to any and every annoyance from the BBC, but so long as the Corporation is funded by a compulsory tax, it will always be the first. True, there are many other vexatious inessentials we are compelled to support through ordinary, general taxation. One thinks, for example, of John Bercow's new, publicly funded PR, tasked with persuading us that this gruesome individual is actually quite appealing. Or of the royal family. Compared with the Duchess of York's pair of parasites, the young princesses Spongerina and Lusherina, Jeremy Clarkson provides sensational value for money. But the BBC's unavoidable, hypothecated levy is, as the Mikester's grovel lengthily reminds us, a unique and permanent reminder of its privileged, virtually almighty status. Whatever the nature of the latest BBC insult or idiocy, it elicits the same objection. Jonathan Ross. Jana Bennett's handbag. BBC Three. Losing Ed Stourton. Golliwogs. What do they pay their talent? The Blue Peter pussycat. Lonely Planet. The extinction of middle-aged women (except Jana Bennett). Unfair competition. Ann Robinson's exhumation. The threat to newspapers. I only watch the snooker. The Gaza appeal. Mark Thompson's salary. How much do we pay for all this? Without any choice in the matter? It always comes back to the licence fee. It always will. Even for those of us who cherish the BBC and consider the licence a bargain, so long as it offers so much that is very good along with BBC Three, it must be increasingly obvious that its already troublesome funding arrangement can only become more fraught. Everyone knows that, like the NHS, this now gargantuan creature emerged in a different, uncompetitive, pre-digital world, where no one could conceive of either Jonathan Ross or of a populace that might have done something wicked enough to deserve him. Little has been heard, in recent months, from the respectable refuseniks who cited Ross as a reason not to buy a licence and who urged others to follow suit. Maybe the BBC has had them put to death. After all, another telly person, James Murdoch, recently described its operations as ""chilling"". Though most right-thinking people might only think more highly of any institution that has been attacked by young Murdoch (much as he is to be congratulated on saying ""better society"" without laughing), the BBC is gathering more plausible enemies all the time. Even if its sprawling operation did not now, rather inconveniently, challenge the livelihoods of newspapers that report and comment on BBC activities, it faces many other threats to its existence. If the current Tory position is limited to freezing or reducing the licence fee, that is no guarantee that any perceived leftiness will not, in future, reawaken that party's traditional loathing of this broadcasting poll tax. But much more ominous is the hostility towards payment, for anything, of the young people that Ross, Moyles and Brand are employed specifically to seduce. How can consumers raised on free music, journalism, videos, jokes, information, learning, phone calls, socialising and books, to list just some of their free stuff, be compelled to pay for television? It is this generation that is about to be subjected to the BBC's tax. Whether it likes it or not, the attitude of this audience, unprecedented in its history, is going to force the BBC to consider moving to payment by subscription. At least, since Lyons reports that most licence-payers say they value its programmes, there is evidence that many millions may become amenable. And the arrangement may even have some advantages. For as long as its audience has an understandable sense of entitlement, the complaints and rancour, about every aspect of the Corporation, will never cease. Nobody would mind so much, if the BBC were independent, what it paid its executives, or its talent, or spent on their flowers and handbags. As for the programming: supposing it were no longer expected to be a universal, infallibly pleasing service, the BBC could give up its endless struggle to be everything, to everyone, everywhere. Relieved of state duties and obliged to refine its services for a paying audience, it could concentrate, as in the past, on news and high-quality programmes; lose Moyles, Lonely Planet, Thought for the Day, and all the junk that you might find anywhere. Obviously, for consumers, this might also mean fewer letters from Sir Michael Lyons. But you can't have everything.","Dear BBC, why oh why don't you just ditch the licence fee? | Catherine Bennett",2009-09-12T23:06:20Z,Catherine Bennett,uk
"As non-celebrity prisoners will be aware, you have to be a pretty special kind of inmate to make an impression on international affairs. But even common or garden offenders must now be wondering if Gordon Brown's reported reluctance for Abdelbaset al-Megrahi to ""pass away in prison"" could conceivably translate into an interest in the final days of prisoners who lack the political X-factor. Is this government, to paraphrase Mr Miliband, not ""actively seeking"" their death in prison as well? Or does this philanthropy only shine through when we're sucking up to a dictator? Even if Gordon Brown's sudden interest in prisoner welfare was no more meaningful than his subsequent concern for Susan Boyle, it cannot alter the fact that, with the release of Megrahi, we have a timely reminder that it might sometimes be right for a very sick prisoner to go home to die. Always supposing that, like Megrahi, the prisoner is fortunate enough, or young enough, to have a home, as well as a supportive tyrant, to welcome him back. It does not seem to have tempered the prime minister's sympathy that, in this case, the relevant dying person had been found guilty of one of the most monstrous crimes in history. Good news, then, for England's growing population of ailing inmates, each of whose crimes inflicted agony on fewer living people than did Megrahi's – or the Libyan authorities' – act of inhumanity. Thanks to Labour's enthusiasm for imprisonment, there are going to be more of these nameless lags than ever: prodigious numbers of frail or dying prisoners advancing, at their different speeds, towards a state of harmlessness. According to the Howard League for Penal Reform, there are already 2,265 prisoners aged over 60, of whom 129 are over 76. Last year, 94 prisoners died in our jails from natural causes. So should prisoners always be released in circumstances where, as the Scottish secretary for justice Kenny MacAskill put it (perhaps hoping to present the Megrahi release to hardliners as a kind of ethical version of capital punishment), they soon face ""a sentence imposed by a higher power""? The divine tariff, he piously continued, ""is one that no court, in any jurisdiction, in any land, could revoke or overrule. It is terminal, final and irrevocable. He is going to die"". Stirring stuff, though you might think it a little unfair, assuming Mr MacAskill's ultimate Line Manager considers mortality a punishment rather than a route to everlasting bliss, that He plans to impose the same penalty on everyone, irrespective of their conduct. Many of the nicest people have the most horrible deaths. If MacAskill is right, and imminent death should end the state's responsibility for punishment, judicial systems could surely save themselves a good deal of trouble, not only by freeing the relevant criminals, but by not even bothering to catch them in the first place. It is not only ancient DNA cases that might be abandoned, given the limited scope for retribution. Where decrepitude also makes a mockery of deterrence and rehabilitation, what is the point of prison? Why are German lawyers still attempting, years after he was first charged, to lock up John Demjanjuk? Guilty or not of helping to murder 28,000 men women and children at the Sobibor death camp, he must have, at the age of 89, very few punishable years left in him. The same applies to the Bavarian war criminal and furniture salesman, Josef Scheungraber, who has just been convicted for his part in the execution of 10 civilians in wartime Italy. By coincidence, Scheungraber, 90, was finally imprisoned in August, just before MacAskill reminded us of the ""terminal, final and irrevocable"" sentence that awaits us all. The German court was not alone in finding natural wastage no substitute for punishment. ""The verdict strengthens the view that the long time gap in no ways diminishes the perpetrator's guilt and that age offers no legal protection for the murders,"" said Efraim Zuroff, of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre. The centre duly deplored the Megrahi release, given that ""the life sentence originally given to this mass murder was society's way of standing up for justice and in solidarity with the innocent victims"". But what of very old, or dying English and Welsh prisoners guilty of less heinous offences? Or of prisoners with such advanced mental illness that they no longer resemble the personality who offended? A 2002 Oxford study discovered a 69-year-old inmate whose dementia was such that he had ""no recollection of his crime and no idea that he was in prison"". Yet in an English prison he remained. Other elderly inmates, though their crimes may preclude release, now find themselves serving a double sentence. Denied liberty, they are also likely to be bullied or damagingly neglected in overcrowded prisons designed to house a much smaller number of sturdy, ambulant young criminals. So long as the state, rather than the victims of crime, remains the dispenser of mercy, it will have to formulate a fairer, more sophisticated policy than the current offer, similar to Scotland's, of compassionate release for terminally sick prisoners predicted to die within three months. Where, that is, those prisoners have benefited from the kind of medical diagnosis and legal argument that was available to Megrahi. Considering that the over-60s are now the fastest-growing group in prison, thanks to a combination of longevity, later and longer sentencing, and Labour's love of the lock-up, there is astonishingly little official interest in weighing up the case for compassion for a dying or enfeebled prisoner, against compassion for his or her victims. Indeed, there is still no national strategy for the care of older prisoners, even disabled prisoners in wheelchairs: they must take their chances with the 21 year olds. Long before Megrahi qualified for compassion, the case for reform was obvious. The Prison Reform Trust argued in Doing Time, a paper published last year, that terminally ill patients should be allowed to apply for compassionate release up to 12, rather than three months, before they are expected to die, given the difficulties of assessment and since prisoners may not be moved quickly enough to prevent them expiring in jail. One inmate described the fate of a newly diagnosed cancer patient, much liked on his ward. Refused a transfer to hospital on security grounds, the sick man died within weeks, without morphine, ""in agony in his cell and all alone"". Undoubtedly, there are criminals for whom a lonely death in prison might be considered the ideal conclusion. But, somehow, one of the most prominent members of this small group has elicited a degree of formal compassion that is routinely denied, in England, to prisoners whose state of debility might actually deserve it. We must hope, when news of this injustice reaches Him that Mr MacAskill's Higher Power has something to say about it.",Where's the compassion for the old lags who truly deserve it? | Catherine Bennett,2009-09-05T23:15:00Z,Catherine Bennett,world
"Has a new Hollywood law been passed that women must henceforth get a hard time in trendy, left-field rom-coms? Looking at recent output, particularly the latest US hit, (500) Days of Summer, there seems to be a new trend for female characters being placed in the background or in the wrong, but definitely nowhere women want to be. Alarm bells should have rung with (500) Days when one found the Smiths featured prominently. Sure enough, the hero (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) turns out to be channelling high-octane passive aggression through a moody indie kid haircut he's far too old for. Meanwhile, the wonderful Zooey Deschanel isn't allowed to become a real character, rather a cipher for his self-important misery. It gets to the point where Morrissey, wailing on the hero's behalf (to paraphrase: ""Please, let him get what he wants because it will be the first time!"") creates a problem. I don't think I'll be only female thinking: this guy shouldn't get what he wants. He is a miserable, bitter little freak, and even an under-written girlfriend is too good for him. Then again, what else should one expect from the latest in ""vérité rom-coms""? At what point did supposedly cool, postmodern rom-coms start mainly peddling the male point of view? When did the requisite ""refreshing new twist"" become casual misogyny? Although engaging in places, this film is a case in point. Never mind (500) Days, one is barely 20 seconds into it before a female is being ""jokily"" referred to as a ""bitch"". From there, Deschanel, the Great Rejecter, is variously portrayed as messed up, strange and cold. Even then, she does better than most heroines in such films who have had guys vomiting over them or had to fall in love while making porn movies. And while Judd Apatow may seem to have started this with the likes of The 40-Year-old Virgin and Knocked Up, to me, it seems more sub-Apatow, many of these rude, crude, shoddy efforts having followed in the wake of the director's generally superior fare. This is not meant in support of the archetypal formulaic rom-com: (Love Actually? No, frankly). However, at least the classic (female-driven) rom-coms rarely resort to spewing outright misandry. In Bridget Jones's Diary, Colin Firth and Hugh Grant didn't end up sourly slated, with vintage Alanis Morisette screeching in the background. Indeed, the question must be raised: who ever agreed to the sulking, hating, misery nerds taking over the rom-com asylum? Strangest of all with (500) Days is this sense that women should be grateful for the role reversal - the fact that a man is hankering after a woman. The same hero who refers to his muse as an ""evil, emotionless, miserable human being"" who ""took a giant shit on my face""? Oh yes, we're very grateful.  Indeed, this is the point when you think about it - wasn't this kind of woman hatred once confined to slasher movies? There might even have been more honesty in giving ""uppity bitches"" axes through the face, instead of sullen character assassinations behind their backs. It's as if Hollywood is saying: ""Guys, bring me your nastiest, most screwed-up thoughts about women and we'll turn them... into gentle romantic comedies!"" Which appears to be the real (industry-based) ""new twist"". At least Lars von Trier's Antichrist is brazenly weird about women - there can be no ambiguity when Charlotte Gainsbourg spends one scene trying to lop off her clitoris. By contrast, the likes of (500) Days try to hide their casual misogyny behind vérité. (This is what guys really think!) Well, maybe some of us are weary of ""what guys really think"". What about what women are really like? Indeed, Smiths soundtrack or not, eventually it's going to have to sink in that ""chicks"" in ""chick movies"" don't have to be treated so miserably. Get a life, Madonna, and while you're about it, give Lourdes one, too How deliciously creepy that Madonna has dressed daughter Lourdes up as a mini-me for her video, Celebration. Or am I just missing out on the latest maternal trend? ""Hey daughter, get over here, I want to crimp your hair like it's 1985!"" It might be more forgivable if La Ciccone had chosen another era. Frozen would have worked. Cherish also, if you forgot the waves crashing suggestively between the thighs in the video. However, Lourdes is dressed circa Like a Virgin, when Mum's Madonna/whore boy-toy complex was at full pelt. How old is Lourdes again? Twelve? Lovely.  Then again, it could be that Madonna isn't so ""out there"" or crazy. She may be just be an extreme example of Generation Ego, a swath of modern parents so self-indulgent they find it unbearable to conceive that their children may end up as completely separate beings. Their children are not props, but human beings with lives and accomplishments of their own? Get out of here! So let's all send our children into the world as mere DNA replicants, who must exist only to reflect past parental glories, little human memory boxes, discarding fanciful nonsense such as personal destiny and autonomy. As Lourdes might say if the poor mite weren't 12, what's all that beside the honour of being your mother's own second-generation drag act?  I'm living proof that Terry Wogan can be wrong I have mixed feelings about Terry Wogan saying news-reading is a piece of cake and that anyone can read the autocue. On the one hand, Wogan seems commendably anti-pompous (he was reacting to an incident when Kate Silverton was rubbished for her makeover show background). However, he is wrong. For some, telly stuff is anything but easy. Maybe you have noticed I am never on TV. Is this because I high-mindedly refuse to sully my craft with tawdry forays on to the nation's screens? Yeah (shifty glance) if you like. The truth is that I'm bad on TV - the sort of shocking car crash bad that doesn't come around very often. Once, years ago, I did an autocue test for a cultural vehicle where my delivery was so deep-frozen they practically had to melt me with blowtorches afterwards. Another time, lured on to a cable show, I spent so much time twitching, gulping and clawing at my neckline an assistant asked if I was having an asthma attack. Then there was my stint as host of What the Papers Say. In retrospect, my performance was a fine, postmodern meshing of Albert Brooks's sweating scene in Broadcast News and Ray Liotta having his brain eaten in Hannibal. Once the tumbleweed had finished bouncing, I was enfolded in a group hug by the production team, apparently deeply moved by my refusal to be held back by my obvious learning difficulties. This is how I decided that TV wasn't for me (or did TV do the deciding?) Also why, while I get all giddy and flattered to be asked on, say, Question Time, people who know me always say: ""Don't do it, you'll be sacked."" The consensus is that if I value my career, I should hide myself from public gaze and remain cringeing and snorting in the shadows. In my defence, I'm not alone. A colleague tells me that whenever he's on TV he's irresistibly reminded of Guy Goma (the guy the BBC famously wrongly interviewed). Indeed, there's no shame in this unless people like Wogan start piping up. Sorry, Tel, you're mistaken, this TV-autocue thing is a definite and separate talent - you're fortunate if you have it and, if you don't, be advised to steer well clear. Good times? It's revealed that supervisors at the US embassy in Kabul have been holding parties featuring abuse, nudity, brawls, urination on guests, and the eating of crisps and drinking of vodka shots from people's ""buttock cracks"".

"The BBC top brass will probably be relieved by the findings of the latest Guardian/ICM poll. True, there'll be disappointment that they couldn't muster a clear majority in favour of the licence fee, even if this poll shows that the licence fee remains the most popular method of funding for the corporation, ranked ahead of both advertising and subscriptions. And there will – and should – be alarm that as many as 58% reject the notion that the BBC is more likely to tell the truth than the likes of ITV or Sky. It's surely central to the BBC's raison d'etre that it will always be more reliable in providing truthful news than those broadcasters who serve a corporate owner. Otherwise, the poll confirms what the BBC's advocates have always said is true. As I argued earlier this week, the BBC remains admired and trusted. This survey shows that 77% of us regard the BBC as ""a national institution we should be proud of"", while 69% declare it trustworthy. Most think it is politically unbiased and close to two in three believe it provides good value for money. In an age of deep scepticism, when deference is dead and trust in institutions is eroding fast, these are strikingly high figures. Those who attack the BBC – whether political parties or rival media organisations – should ask themselves whether an opinion poll about them would bring numbers anywhere near as good. Still, the BBC should rest on the laurels of these results for about as long as it takes to read them. It has some work to do, especially it seems on the licence fee, backed by just 43%. Here's one suggestion. One reader emailed me this week to say, ""I am convinced that there are many people who view their Sky subscription of, say, £45 a month as good value, but their licence fee of £142.50 a year as poor value."" I suspect he's right. But what if Sky had to advertise their subscription as an annual sum, the same way the licence fee is always expressed? For plenty of customers, it would come out at £540. Wouldn't sound quite so attractive then, would it? But this works two ways. If I were the BBC, I'd never let the £142.50 annual figure pass my lips. It should say the BBC costs each of us £11.88 a month. Not bad for five TV channels, five national radio stations, several more digital ones, a local radio station in every corner of the land, one of the planet's largest newsgathering operations and a world-class website.

"Credit where it's due: the free-market right is nothing if not brave. Fainter-hearted souls would have spotted the imminent first anniversary of the collapse of Lehman brothers that started the global financial crisis and decided that now was not the moment to trumpet the case for unfettered private enterprise, free of meddling regulation. But the evangelists for turbo-charged capitalism are made of sterner stuff. With the American conservative assault on Britain's ""Nazi"" and ""Orwellian"" National Health Service still fresh in the memory, a leading US free marketeer has trained his sights on another British institution: the BBC. He is James Murdoch whose weekend MacTaggart lecture was a 39-minute plea for comprehensive deregulation, warning of the dangers of state interference in the ""natural diversity"" of the media industry. Of the recent history of deregulation, with its catastrophic consequences for the world's economy, there was not a mention. Nor did he detain his audience at the Edinburgh television festival, sponsored by the Guardian, with a declaration of his own interest in the subject. He spoke as if he were a mere policy wonk, rather than the heir to a broadcasting empire that would make billions if he had his way and the BBC were cut down to size. This was like a fox arguing that the henhouse doors be thrown wide open – not for his own sake, you understand, but for the good of society. So Murdoch showed some brass neck. But he made some sharp points, too. He is probably right that Ofcom is bloated, poking its nose too often into areas where it's not needed. Right, too, to note that the old distinction between the press (where no rules on impartiality apply) and the broadcasters (obliged to be neutral) makes less sense when the two are rapidly converging, forming ""an all-media market"" where, say, the Guardian and the BBC both run websites that include text, audio and video. These days, we're a bit like a broadcaster and they're a bit like a newspaper, and the rules probably ought to reflect that. (Though if that means dropping the impartiality obligation on the TV networks there are two words to give us pause: Fox News.) Of course, a Murdoch attacking the BBC is not news. But these are perilous times for the organisation. Buffeted by a series of scandals and set to face a Conservative government headed by a man whose sole job outside politics was as PR man for a private TV company, the BBC should feel vulnerable. David Cameron has warned that we're entering a new age of austerity, and that will surely include the BBC and its licence fee. James Murdoch, bent on continuing the war Rupert started, might succeed where his father failed. Which is why his argument has to be tackled head on. First, his case is undermined by the fact that, while everyone has their pet grumbles, most Britons feel a strong attachment to the BBC. Those Republican attacks on the NHS ran into a solid wall of British affection for the service, and a similar fate awaits any attempt to argue that the great malaise in our national life is the BBC. Most Britons continue to use it and trust it: one survey last year put the BBC at the top of a list of trusted institutions, ahead of the NHS, the church and the military. Or take the view from abroad. The BBC is one of the few British exports to be universally recognised as world class. That's why BBC programmes from The Blue Planet to the Dickens adaptations are snapped up around the globe. They may not be watching Bleak House in Burma or Iran, but they are relying on BBC News for an independent, truthful view of the world. Spend a day absorbing public television and radio in the US. They do their best, but the begging bowl of fundraising appeals intrudes regularly. You have to listen to National Public Radio's Morning Edition to realise quite what we have in the Today programme. It's not just slicker and better resourced. It actually does a civic job, invigilating those who hold elected power, following an agenda set not by a profit-seeking corporation but by the journalists themselves. Speech radio of the kind served up 24 hours a day on the BBC barely exists as a form outside Britain. (Full disclosure: I present The Long View, an occasional series on BBC Radio 4.) It adds up to an output not achieved anywhere else, by any other funding model. To get rid of it, even to shrink it into the ""far, far smaller"" BBC James Murdoch yearns for, would be an act of cultural vandalism. We'd only appreciate what we had once it was gone. For the very thing that so appals Murdoch is what makes the BBC precious. As with the NHS, it ensures that part of our national life is organised according to principles other than profit and loss. We are not customers of the NHS, nor of the BBC. Our relationship with it is measured in a less tangible, but ultimately more valuable, currency than pounds and pence. Murdoch cannot understand that. The final sentence of his speech declared: ""The only reliable, durable and perpetual guarantor of independence is profit."" These are perennial arguments for the BBC, but that does not mean nothing should change. Murdoch was heard respectfully in Edinburgh partly because the BBC has allowed its critics too many grounds for opposition and partly because other media companies, threatened with extinction by declining advertising revenues, eye jealously a BBC beast which only seems to get bigger, forever insulated from those pressures. So the BBC should not wait for a Cameron administration to act. It should move first, blunting its critics' strongest lines of attack. The bosses could reduce costs instantly, and visibly, by paying themselves far less. There is no reason why the director general, Mark Thompson, should be paid £816,000, as he was last year. He can't claim that that is the market rate, since the BBC does not operate like any other company in the market. His salary should be pegged to the rest of the public sector. If Gordon Brown can get by on £185,000, so should Thompson. Next, the BBC can rein in its ceaseless expansion. It had every right to move online, but it surely cannot justify buying up the Lonely Planet travel guides. Again, its unique privilege is that it does not have to operate according to market logic. Which means it does not have to behave like a rapacious media giant. Then it could do something really bold, fulfilling its public service remit by providing something the market is failing to provide. Local newspapers are dying or dead. Yet towns and cities across Britain need to know what is happening in their councils, town halls and police forces. The BBC has an army of reporters and offices across the land, unmatched by any other news organisation. Why doesn't it set aside a few millions to cover those unreported communities – then put the results into the public realm, ""open source"" style. Commercial radio stations could pick up audio of the council leader; a local paper could run a BBC-originated report from the court. If people are worried about state-run media let the BBC share the money with, say, the Press Association. The BBC ought to do this, before even its friends come to resent its gargantuan size and scale. But this cannot be a matter solely for media folk.

"The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Monday 21 September 2009 The column below repeated a myth of the second world war, fostered by Nazi propagandists, when it said that Polish lancers turned their horses to face Hitler's panzers. There is no evidence that this occurred. We are awash in history. This week the Poles again climb on stage, as they do each time anniversary journalism returns to the second world war. It is 70 years since German ships bombarded the fort of Gdansk, then known as the free city of Danzig, while Polish lancers turned their horses to face Hitler's Panzers in the most romantic and idiotic act of suicide of modern war. Last month we heard the fell tones of Chamberlain announcing: ""We are at war with Germany."" Next spring we shall be back in Dunkirk. Meanwhile we must also take time off to record the 40th anniversary of Gadaffi of Libya, the 30th anniversary of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the fifth of the Beslan massacre. While gazing at the calendar we might recall the 40th anniversary of vasectomy, the 50th of the M1 motorway, the 60th of the chairmanship of Mao, the 80th of the traffic light and the centenary of the force-feeding of suffragettes. There is no end to the trough of history at which hungry readers can feed. History always arrives with its raucous child, lessons to be learned. Today the glib linking of any passing dictator with Adolf Hitler continues to pollute analysis of international relations. It is impossible to write against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan or the so-called war on terror without being accused of guilt by association with 1930s appeasement – usually by Americans, who were the most serious appeasers of all. The idea that questioning any military adventure, however ill-advised, must be a re-enactment of Chamberlain at Munich is worse than an abuse of history. It is an offence against the millions who died in Europe and Asia in the terrible years before, during and after the second world war. To put the war on terror in the same historical basket as the war against Nazism is like equating a single terrorist bomb to Hiroshima. Yet it is leading thousands of soldiers and civilians to their deaths, on the pretext that ""western civilisation"" is being threatened in the sense that it was in 1939. History is like the law. It offers raw material for anyone who wants to plead a cause or make some money. Earlier this year the Russian president Dmitry Medvedev set up a historical truth commission on the second world war to accept Soviet guilt over the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact and the Katyn massacre. But a member of the commission said yesterday that it would not shy from describing the roles of Polish, British and French participants in the Munich conspiracy. The trouble is, the former were facts and the latter a Soviet spin on a western humiliation. Parallels with the past are always dangerous, whether in the hands of experts or charlatans. Just as the pro-war party in Afghanistan cites appeasement, so the anti-war party trumpets Britain's Afghan campaigns in the 19th century and the Russian fiasco in the 1980s. Enlisted against the war is also Vietnam – mesmerising for students of Kennedy's intervention in support of President Diem. Then too the US was sucked into an Asian imbroglio by assuming ""my enemy's enemy is my friend"". Then too one American general after another declared a war ""do-able"", if only more troops were sent and more attention paid to hearts and minds. Vietnam is rich in lessons that seem to have been ignored by both US and British governments in Afghanistan, but they are not precise parallels. The Russians in Afghanistan were largely defeated by Taliban armed by the CIA with Stinger missiles. If the Taliban had Stingers today, the American occupation would soon be over. Among other things, the US has allies. In Vietnam it was eager to involve Britain. Though the prime minister, Harold Wilson, never publicly criticised Lyndon Johnson's Vietnam escalation, he was determined that British troops would not be drawn into a war which he rightly sensed would end in tears, like France's previous conflict also with Ho Chi Minh. Wilson was a better student of history than Blair or Brown. Afghanistan is not Vietnam, any more than it is Iraq, or Kosovo, or Lebanon. Its geography, its politics and its point in history are different. If anything, it is even more intractable as an occupation, since the war in Vietnam was against the expansion of communist dictatorship, which did impinge on western security. In Afghanistan war can easily be portrayed as a crude assault on Islam. The rest of Europe, which stayed out of Vietnam, was drawn to Kabul by a reluctant loyalty to Nato, which makes withdrawal harder to contemplate. But the reluctance was not some memory of past appeasement. It was because the peoples of Europe did not see any serious threat to their security from the Taliban brigades or al-Qaida's ""Af-Pak training camps"". They did not equate 9/11 with the Nazi Holocaust. They saw it as the work of murderous madmen who evaded the world's greatest intelligence apparat and got lucky. It was an outrage without historical antecedent and should not be awarded one. All interventions in the  muslim world tend to ignore all previous interventions, as Lawrence of Arabia furiously complained. Each starts as if on a blank sheet of paper and creeps along a painful path from ignorance to wisdom through trial and error. It was scarcely believable on Monday that the senior American general in Kabul, Stanley McChrystal, should advise his president after eight years of occupation that it might be a good idea to train the Afghan army and ""win hearts and minds"". Writing of the Great Crash in 1929, JK Galbraith concluded that the only real lesson such catastrophes could teach is that they happened. They could, therefore, happen again. In that fact lay their lesson. But what is the good when even such facts are ignored? History is not bunk. It is a glorious seam of human experience from which leaders can seek guidance on their present conduct. But its parallels are never exact and are easy to distort, while its lessons are quarrelsome. Today we are not, anywhere, retreading the same foothills as we did on the outbreak of the second world war. If that is the best parallel we can draw to illustrate our discontents, we should ban history from public debate.

"The following correction was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday 6 September 2009  In the article below the argument that Scottish history has been too long ignored in the nation's classroom was emphasised by reference to ""Bonnie Montrose"". We should have said Bonnie Dundee, of course – James Graham, the 1st Marquess of Montrose, having never been known as ""Bonnie"", especially after he was executed and his head put on a spike.   A vile legend has insinuated itself about the sudden death of Catherine the Great of Russia. The insatiable old empress was a relentless fornicator and, having worked through most of her male courtiers, she soon began to bestow her favours on the royal household guard. Occasionally, one at a time. Predictably, the Russian army's finest were no match for the lascivious entreaties of their queen and thus it came to pass that her blameless prize stallion was soon pressed into service. Alas, during one of their encounters, the loyal cuddy collapsed and crushed his mistress to death. I know this now to be a gross distortion of the facts because Mr McGuire, the best teacher I ever had, told me so… before administering four strokes of his favourite Lochgelly leather belt to my sweaty adolescent palms. He felt that his St Ninian's third-year history class was not yet ready to hear of my unsolicited social research into Imperial Russia and was sorely vexed about the matter. Nevertheless, a seed had been sown, and I fell in love with my history studies, guided by the sardonic wisdom of a giant among pedagogues. We got Russian history, German history, English history and American history. The causes of the First World War were scrutinised, and the Seven Years' War, the Hundred Years' War and the War of Jenkins's asterisking Ear. Yet there was very little of Scotland's history, its people and its struggles. Actually, that is not strictly true. For did we not also discover how ancient Scots had constructed their wee houses on Scapa Flow? Of Thomas Telford and John Knox, though, and Bonnie Montrose and Malcolm Canmore and Mary Queen of Scots we were fearfully ignorant. Indeed, you could only encounter a detailed history of our nation if you had chosen to study it at either of the two universities which offered it as a degree course. It is a scandalous state of affairs that, somehow, has been allowed to prevail right up until this year when for the first time ever a separate and fully fledged history paper will be included in the Higher course being offered to Scottish pupils. It may yet prove to be the most important political decision made by the SNP government. Several reasons have been advanced as to why generations of Scottish schoolchildren have been kept in the dark about their nation's rich and glorious story. There never has been any enthusiasm by Labour politicians and administrators to enfranchise our children into the knowledge of Scotland's bewitching tapestry. Imagination is not a quality often found within the ranks of Labour politicians and they felt that to teach Scottish history in our schools would be to drive these innocents into the arms of the nationalist bogeyman. Nor did it seem that there was much pressure brought to bear on the examination authorities by Scottish history academics to encourage meaningful study of their subject in schools. Recently, Professor Tom Devine of Edinburgh University chose to denounce the teaching of history in schools over the past 50 years as a disgrace. I don't think Devine is entirely correct. There have been some wonderful history teachers in Scotland and the subject has been much loved by thousands who chose not to pursue it beyond school. What is a disgrace, though, is the reluctance to include much of Scotland in the syllabus. The Scottish history course will begin to dismantle the wall of ignorance that exists among Scots about their country. It is simply woeful that generations of us have lived our lives not knowing the achievements of this country on the international stage and of the influence we have held in global politics from the 12th century onwards. Many of Scotland's philosophers, engineers, academics and entrepreneurs are celebrated and lauded in foreign countries. Yet their achievements go unfeted in the land of their birth. Bizarrely, the last Labour administration wasted few opportunities in reminding Scots and others that sectarianism is ""Scotland's secret shame"", while trying to market the country as a grown-up and sophisticated destination for inward investment. Conferences and summits were organised to address the situation and no one can doubt Jack McConnell's sincerity in tackling it. Yet the study of the causes and effects of the Reformation in Scotland, which is a vital component of the new history course, will remove, at a stroke, the ignorance about this issue which is at the root of all sectarian strife. The knowledge and appreciation of Scotland's place in the world and where we came from will, in time, increase the confidence of our children and their pride in what it means to be Scottish. And it could address the myopia that afflicts the view of too many Scots about our relations with England. It may also increase the status of history teachers everywhere. Once upon a time, they were a hallowed and feared clan with their brown corduroy jackets that often sported leather patches. There were also Hush Puppies. They ruled with an ironic and rheumy eye and, in the afternoon, the flecked evidence of their lunch-time ales was often apparent on their bewhiskered jowls. They were men of substance and a little style and I hope that they can hold their heads up once more.",At long last Scotland is getting her history back| Kevin McKenna,2009-08-29T23:05:58Z,Kevin McKenna,uk
"Now that we have so much unemployment again, isn't it time we stopped arbitrarily lumping everyone together in one amorphous mass as ""the Unemployed""? If previous slumps taught us anything, surely it is that there are sub-strands to unemployment like everything else, one of the chief ones being age. It is one thing to be young unemployed, when you have maximum energy and minimum responsibility and can still pursue your dreams in an unorthodox fashion, or at least loll around of an afternoon in your pants watching Cash in the Attic. It's quite another to be old unemployed, probably with mortgages, children, rising debt and the dread feeling that this is it, the end of the line and all that is left is a vista of grey, unbroken recession-gloom. Other sub-strands could be the short-term unemployed, long-term, skilled, unskilled and so on. Then there is a new one I've only just heard of – ""the Missing Unemployed"", these being the estimated 750,000 middle-class people who have lost their jobs in the ""white-collar recession"", but have not been claiming any benefits. Instead, they are presumed to be living off savings, redundancy payments or being supported by a spouse who is still earning. The presumption is that three-quarters of a million people either don't realise they can claim benefits, wouldn't know where to begin or are simply too proud and dignified to do so. Or as one government source put it: ""People who do not think of themselves as the sort of people who claim benefits."" Oh, those sorts of people, I see. Then again, I don't. Some might argue that the missing unemployed are a good, selfless development as every day they remain ""missing"" they are saving the country money. Well, in the short term, this may work, but long term? Wouldn't it be rather odd to have as many as 750,000 people wandering around for months, even years, pretending not to be unemployed? Just as odd in fact as if the same number were wandering around pretending to be Napoleon. It would perhaps be better for their mental health to realise that (hello!) ""unemployed"" has become a pertinent fact about them, in the same vein as home address or eye colour. If one wanted to be churlish, one could almost read a bizarre arrogance into the missing unemployed. The underlying message seems to be that the middle classes have far too much dignity to become benefits-literate, like their ""lazy"" working-class counterparts. However, surely poorer people, in long-term jobless areas, have had no choice but to become benefits-literate – there is nothing undignified about the mechanics of survival. Then there is the point that the missing unemployed may feel that the money they could claim is such a pittance it is not worth making the effort. They're probably right, but again, poorer people tend not to have the luxury of choice. Moreover, where is the herd loyalty? Isn't it the social duty of the missing unemployed to come out of the shadows and declare themselves, even if claiming benefits is an alien concept, even if the money they claim is a pittance? As disparate as the many sub-strands of the unemployed may be, isn't it still best to stick together? This seems preferable to what the missing unemployed are doing now, which amounts to enabling the government to hide truly appalling unemployment figures, whereas more honest statistics may lead to faster, more effective unemployment policies for all. What is the alternative? The missing unemployed continuing to lurk in the shadows. Perhaps they're refusing altogether to embrace the ""u"" word and, like actors too proud to admit they haven't worked a day since Eldorado folded, proclaiming that they are not unemployed at all – oh, no, darling, they are ""resting""! It's high time the missing unemployed made their minds up – missing, resting, whatever – are they out of a job or not? Alan Duncan – what a superstar. Yes, you read that rightCould Alan Duncan be in any more trouble? Will we discover that he has immigrant child slaves locked away in an attic room growing blind as they sew cravats for him? Or that he bathes nightly in Dom Perignon, guffawing at the petty grumbles of the common man? Or is what we've got all we're getting and it's quite enough anyway? Poor, posh, deluded Al ranting away in front of the secret camera of green on-line magazine Don't Panic, about MPs ""living on rations"" and being ""treated like shit"", adding: ""No one who has done anything in the outside world will ever come into this place ever again, the way we're going."" No wonder David Cameron is so angry. Enid Blyton gave us the Naughtiest Girl at School; now, the Tory party presents the Naughtiest Boy at Westminster. What a hoot! Indeed, in and out of his party, Duncan seems to be about as popular as a swine-flu sneeze in a packed lift right now. Or is he? Duncan happens to be the MP for my old neck of the woods, Rutland and Melton. My parents still live there and even with non-Tory voters, Duncan is genuinely popular. My mother and several other people we know have written to him a few times over the years about who knows what tedious Rutland-related issues (the crystal-meth problem at barn dances?). It doesn't matter. The point is that every single time, Duncan replied, swiftly, courteously, helpfully and, ultimately, rather impressively. I know! It's almost too horrific to contemplate – could it possibly be that, for all his ridiculousness last week, away from the secret and not so secret cameras, Duncan is a popular, hardworking MP. Someone diligent about responding to the concerns of his constituents, who does not flinch from listening to people rant about street lights and wheelie bins. Not that I am suggesting Duncan hasn't behaved like a petulant muppet. However, just because an MP makes an arse of himself on the Westminster stage, it doesn't mean that, quietly, away from the limelight, they're not good at the job they were elected to do. Don't let the sun go down on the magnificent KateThere was such cattiness directed at Kate Moss for looking ""sun-damaged"" and ""dodgy"" on a yacht in the South of France. There were huge photos of her resembling a supermodel moon map (craters! wrinkles!) accompanied by apocalyptic conjecture about ""How it happened!"" (wild guess: sun, fags, partying) and ""What can be done!"" People have been waiting to cry: ""Kate Moss looks dodgy"" for years. It's one of the big moments of our time, like the millennium or Haley's comet. In years to come, our grandchildren will gaze up adoringly and ask: ""What were you doing when Kate Moss started resembling a rough Gillian Taylforth?"" And I, for one, will gaze back, equally fondly and say: ""I was cheering her on, love."" The wonderful thing about Moss is that she simply doesn't care. Hers is a unique stance in a world where women are terrified of being criticised for their looks; where there can be a news story about a woman in a ""burkini""; and you just know that among the self-hating masses there will be the odd woman secretly thinking: ""Where can I get one of those?"" Enter Moss, who makes a living from her looks, but is still happy to sprawl on yachts with no make-up, sucking on a cig, gently sozzled, enjoying her life. She is a totem of carefree female freedom. Which is why women should make a point of cherishing her, not criticising her. What will become of British woman-kind if even Mossy starts getting self-conscious?","Out of a job, but won't admit it?

"Eat GM: ""Better than starving to death!"" It is not the most persuasive slogan in the history of food advertising. Nor, with this as his pitch, is Hilary Benn, the environment minister, ever likely to compete, as a twinkly salesman of repulsive treats, with figures such as Cap'n Birds Eye or Tony the Tiger. But he has to find some reason why, after refusing them for years, the picky British must now learn to love GM. ""The truth,"" Benn actually said, when he added GM to his new range of national austerity measures, ""is we will need to think about the way in which we produce our food, the way in which we use water and fertiliser. We will need science, we will need more people to come into farming because it has a bright future."" Did he mean that the only modern, sustainable farming is GM farming? If this endorsement was a little half-hearted, compared with what Labour ministers have said in the past, you can see Benn's difficulty. He's terrified that if he is honest about the government's determination to grow commercial GM crops in this country, the public will – to use the technical term – go off on one. At all costs, Benn must avoid a PR disaster like that of a decade ago when Monsanto, the multinational that owns 90% of GM traits (or properties), set about wooing a sceptical British public with a series of huge newspaper advertisements. The tone, funnily enough, was not that different from Benn's last week: modern yet soothing; idealistic yet reasonable. Insufferably patronising. It struck Monsanto, back then, as just the right tone to take with consumers who had recently learnt, following the outbreak of BSE, that their lives had been endangered by a farming industry that fed live cows with dead cows. ""Worrying about future generations won't feed them,"" ran the slogan above one celebrated Monsanto ad, in 1998. ""Food biotechnology will."" Wasn't GM a better prospect, continued the chemicals giant, than conventional farming, whereby, along with lavish use of fertilisers, herbicide and insecticide, ""soil erosion and mineral depletion exhaust the land""? ""While we'd never claim to have solved world hunger at a stroke,"" it conceded – after all, you'd want a couple of days for that – ""biotechnology provides one means to feed the world effectively."" The company was foolish enough, however, to make several, more immediately disprovable claims in its advertisements, for which it was duly rebuked by Britain's Advertising Standards Authority . As well as exaggerating its years of safety testing, the ASA concluded, Monsanto had not made clear in its advertisements that academic opinion on GM technology was divided. To be fair to Monsanto, its advertisements did contribute to a national panic about GM food that helped to divide opinion on GM into two entrenched extremes which continue to this day. Biotech multinationals still bleat about feeding the world when what they are actually doing is selling chemicals to put on their patented crops. Or, in some cases, producing nothing more obviously useful to long-term global well-being than GM flowers. A peculiarly pointless example, the Moonaqua carnation, genetically modified to be purple, was recently approved for import as a cut flower by the EU. ""The colour of these flowers is absolutely novel for carnation,"" says its creator, Florigene, ""and offers the floral industry new uses for carnation."" For instance, the industry can now attempt to camouflage genuine purple carnations inside arrangements of blueberries, something never done before. On the other side, anti-GM campaigners still stress, as they have done for years, a dismal lack of evidence for either the safety or sustainability of GM crops, unless you count sustainable profits or sustainable superweeds, of which there are plenty. Prince Charles still witters about stewardship while he trails carbon around the planet. And much of the British press continues to flag up its enlightened scepticism by inserting the word ""Franken"" before anything related to GM technology. Here, for instance, is the Daily Mirror's opening paragraph on the Hilary Benn story: ""Farmers may soon be allowed to grow 'Frankenstein foods' under new controversial plans."" One or two things have, admittedly, moved on since newspapers adopted this trick. Peter Melchett, for instance, the slayer of GM crops, left Greenpeace and became FrankenPeter, a consultant for the PR firm Burson-Marsteller, whose clients had included his old adversary, Monsanto. Maybe the gap wasn't so unbridgeable after all? More important, as the Observer science correspondent has argued, population growth and climate change are lending a new urgency to the debate. Ten years ago, when food shortages could be attributed to inequitable distribution, war and waste, it was easy for campaigners to dismiss the environmental and health risks of GM as unjustifiable. Now that climate change appears to pose a greater risk, in the shape of absolute food shortages, reflexive opposition to GM crops could start to look, as Hilary Benn is hinting, like attitudinising. Already, he reduces the debate to a matter of safety: sorted. ""The government's job is to ask if it is safe to eat and there is no evidence that it isn't,"" he told the Today programme. ""There is no evidence that it isn't""? As spectacular over-simplifications go, this is up there with the media's time-honoured reduction of the GM critique to Frankenprefixes and is, unfortunately, perfectly designed to rebut it. By focusing, to the exclusion of so much else, on the question of safety, the media have made it too easy for Mr Benn. He discovers no evidence of harm. But where would any intelligent person expect to find it? While the investigation of safety, like every other aspect of GM, from research to patents to the sale of seeds to hard-up peasant farmers, is controlled by biotech multinationals, there will never be any trustworthy evidence one way or the other. The corporations are there to sell the world chemicals and seeds, not to look after it. Thus, the government's job is not, at the moment, to reconsider the safety of GM food. That can come later. Right now, it should explain how, in choosing to bring GM to Britain, it justifies placing this part of our national food policy under the control of a few fantastically aggressive and wholly unaccountable multinationals. Not that they can't be philanthropic. Monsanto recently gave a scholarly institution, the British Biochemical Society, a generous grant for educational materials, such as school websites. No doubt the scientists' Monsanto-funded lessons will explain why, over 10 years since Monsanto offered to end hunger and save the world with GM, neither it, nor anyone in the industry, can offer a single drought-resistant plant. The children will want to know why, on the contrary, the spread of GM has increased the use of pesticides, exacting a greater toll on limited resources. But the biggest question is for the government. Anyone can see why multinationals want control over our food production. But why on earth does Hilary Benn want to hand it over?",Kowtowing to Monsanto still leaves a nasty aftertaste | Catherine Bennett,2009-08-15T23:05:01Z,Catherine Bennett,politics
"Could you ""give the gift of life""? This is the question London's Lister Fertility Clinic addresses to fertile women. ""Egg donors,"" it continues, ""are unique and remarkable women. Their kindness and generosity allows many childless couples to achieve their ultimate dream of having a family."" You gather, correctly, that the women will not be paid for getting themselves assessed, interviewed, weighed, then physically inspected, blood-tested, hormonally adjusted, daily injected and, finally, anaesthetised, so as to have an abnormally high yield of their finite supply of eggs extracted for the benefit of unidentified strangers who might, for all they know, be post-menopausal obsessives to whom you would not entrust an abandoned tortoise. There may be, donors will discover, some level of discomfort. Not forgetting, with this variety of altruism, a very small risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and accompanying, unconfirmed speculation about a link between fertility drugs and ovarian cancer. But still: what a terrific present for someone you've never met. Could the Lister Fertility Clinic, emulating egg donors, also give the gift of life? Could its own kindness and generosity allow many childless couples to ""achieve their ultimate dream""? Take a guess. Like every other private fertility clinic, it puts a price on life-creation. The Lister website gives the cost of basic IVF (excluding drugs and sundries) as £3,210. ""If, in the rare event we are we are unable to collect eggs during your procedure, or if eggs subsequently fail to fertilise,"" it stresses, ""we regret that there can be no alteration to the stated fees."" A bit like a plumber's call-out fee, then, but with a built-in probability that they will not be able to fix your boiler; all the greater if you've had it for a while. ""Nah, sorry love, what cowboy was it told you these – 'scuse me – crappy old eggs would ever work? Yeah, milk two sugars – 'ang on, there's me moby, that'll be £4,000 plus VAT, can I use your toilet?"" Don't you wish you'd trained as a top fertility specialist? The only pressing concern for Britain's leading baby-makers would seem to be the dwindling supply of gametes – or donated eggs and sperm – to cater for the number of would-be parents stalled in the production line. For some people, like the Lib Dems' Dr Evan Harris, who are all in favour of keeping donor children in ignorance of their genetic origins, this shortage of parts is a ""direct and predicable result of the switch away from allowing donors to remain anonymous"". He thinks that a reversal of its decision to end secrecy by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (or HFEA) is the way to restore the supply of free sperm and eggs. But perhaps it hasn't helped, at least where eggs are concerned, that some women's precious gifts of life have ended up, even in Britain, inside ageing mothers such as the mother of three Lynne Bezant. With her first batch of children grown up, Ms Bezant wanted more and was lucky enough to be indulged by Professor Ian Craft, who had already played Angel Gabriel to 60-year-old single parent Elizabeth Buttle. Lynne Bezant gave birth to twins in 2001, when she was 56. ""Egg donation is probably one of the most precious gifts that one woman can give to another,"" Craft's London Fertility Centre tells prospective donors. ""If you are considering donating your eggs, we want you to know that you are a very special lady for considering something like this."" Yet, even with the esteem of Professor Craft as an inducement, too few ladies and gentlemen are coming forward with free gametes. Addressing the shortage, Professor Lisa Jardine, chair of the HFEA, last week proposed that society consider paying donors, which is already standard practice in, among other places, America and Spain. In Britain, only expenses and ""loss of earnings"" up to a total of £250 are allowed, rather better value for male donors, you might think, than for female ones. ""Given the evidence that the egg shortage is driving women overseas,"" said Jardine, ""I feel a responsibility to look at it again."" The proposal of payment was promptly rejected by the British Medical Association (BMA), on the usual slippery slope basis that, pay for sperm and before you know it important bits of Indian peasants will be traded from stalls in Harley Street. ""If you go along this line with gametes, eggs, sperm, you've sort of in a way started a principle that may well extend into other parts of medical care and we really I think would not want to go there,"" Dr Tony Calland of the BMA's ethics committee told the BBC, as if there existed some sort of consensus that rights over one's body should be ceded to the state. In fact, a debate over the sale of organs, the assisted dying controversy and the government's new acknowledgement that organ donors may want certain assurances about their beneficiaries all point to a growing interest in bodily autonomy, in an age when bodies are worth something. Why shouldn't impoverished men and women trade reproductive material if they want to? It may be the only thing they can harmlessly sell. That eggs and sperm are not, in any case, crucial bodily components, but their transient products, with a distinctly limited appeal, does not appease the BMA. ""We feel that donation should be altruistic,"" said Calland. ""We feel that to introduce payment or a market would distort that position and may put people into a risk that they would not otherwise consider."" A risk? If egg donation is not safe, it must make the case for compensation even stronger. As for a market: what else is the national IVF business but a market, to which the rich have privileged access? Already, wealthier patients pay for eggs, without the use of price tags, through a grotesque system called ""egg sharing"". An infertile, though egg-producing young woman is offered ""free"" treatment, subsidised by another patient, following a pact that they will divide her eggs between them. Since the rich woman's additional payment for the eggs goes straight (in what you might consider a staggering conflict of interest) into the pocket of the clinician who counsels and treats the donor, the goods have not, technically, been bought. Not unusually, the egg buyer gets pregnant, but her donor does not. Though altruism has no place in the arrangement, it appears to satisfy the squeamish BMA. But even where selflessness does figure, it is hard to see the clinicians' appeal to the donors' better nature as anything but an insult. The unpaid women's discomfort translates, straightforwardly, into rich men's income, in an industry where the creation of life has, for better or worse, already been thoroughly commodified. The question, surely, is not whether women's eggs should be sold, but how much they should cost? The going rate in Spain, apparently, is €800 or a bit under £700. Which is either an outrage, when compared with the current arrangement or, at rather less than a Mulberry tote, one of the last great bargains.",Why are we so squeamish about paying egg donors? | Catherine Bennett,2009-08-01T23:05:12Z,Catherine Bennett,society
"A day may dawn when my children must come with a bib and give me soup while reminding me gently what names I had once given them. I will point to the field outside and ask them to look at the pretty elephants. They will scold their children for giggling at the old chap in the stripy brown dressing-gown. So, in advance of their cheek, I do hereby give them leave to mock my affliction. It is, if you like, my living will. If my life's narrative is to end with a lopsided grin in a bathchair at sunset being attended to by those whom I have loved, then I will probably be in a distinctly comfortable minority. For hammering at the door at the end of the corridor will be officers of the state – once upon a time they were called nurses – checking their watches ostentatiously and telling them that old Mr McKenna's time is up and that if they would just sign here they can take all the pain and the distress away. The floor will only rarely have seen a mop and there will be no curtains round the bed. It was not a good week to be an elderly person in Britain. A European Commission report revealed that UK pensioners are, relatively, among the poorest in the European Union. One-third of our OAPs is living in poverty. They are worse off than their comrade old gits in Romania and Poland. Meanwhile, an influential Italian doctor has proposed that national supplies of Tamiflu should not be wasted on the elderly because stocks should be preserved for young people. And then five law lords decided that families who want to help their terminally ill relatives commit suicide on ""compassionate"" grounds will be free from prosecution. If you're over 65 with a modest but smart wee property portfolio and been feeling a shade under the weather recently, then please beware of young relatives with vulpine grins bearing a one-way ticket to Switzerland. Our government has just given them the green light to dispatch you… and, of course, it shall all be for your own good owing to your ""unbearable"" suffering. Not long ago, our country was warned that we were sleepwalking into a culture of death. We have the highest abortion rate in Europe and our government has steadfastly refused to lower the limit in the face of the clearest evidence of human viability at 12 weeks or less. We also want to apply the law of the pig farm to producing embryos for the human spare parts business, AKA stem cell research. Now, five ermined hanging judges have chipped another little chunk away from an edifice we once called human dignity. In this Gadarene rush to embrace death at the slightest hint of discomfort, imperfection or simply ""otherness"", being old in 21st-century Britain is to be made to feel very uncomfortable indeed. Last year, Scotland's public services ombudsman condemned several health boards for poor standards of care for elderly patients. In particular, he highlighted as ""inadequate"" the care and dignity shown to an 88-year-old who died in a Glasgow hospital on an open ward. There were no curtains around her bed. There is not a single health authority in the UK where such cases are not commonplace. For in our country, the elderly and the infirm have become a burden that our state is increasingly unwilling to bear. A new philosophy has been allowed to evolve and it could be called compassionism. The uncouth and politically incorrect may call it Shipmanism. This holds that no citizen should be allowed to suffer undue pain as their life ebbs away. But lest we and the government, which has signed up to the human rights charter, be accused of codgercide, all concerned family members shall be deemed to have the best interests of the soon-to-be-deceased at heart if they want to do him in instead. Furthermore, if you are old and unable to hold your spoon, we shall slowly withdraw basic care, food and services from you so that your life is made unbearable and you may seek suicide (assisted, naturally). This has now become close to an imposed orthodoxy. Today, the assisted suicide debate is little more than the slightly inconvenienced middle classes trying to discover ways to remove all prospect of physical suffering from their lives. No one will ever be tried in a UK court for criminally assisting in a suicide. In less than a generation, a sort of pain index will operate in our health boards and very vulnerable people will endure pressure to wake up dead one morning. Resistance will be deemed to be selfish. Yet health professionals involved in palliative care will tell you that pain can be managed to a degree never believed possible a generation ago. And they will bear witness to the sheer humanity that pours forth when a family is allowed the opportunity to share in a parent's final agony. With the onset of old age comes sickness, infirmity and pain. It calls for small acts of heroism, sacrifice and nobility from families and friends. Most of those who reach this state and their loved ones are entitled to believe that they have paid in advance for the best care the state can afford. It is called National Insurance. Once, the attainment of old age was seen as a privilege. In Great Britain, it is now a curse and a shameful thing.",Beware the perils of getting old in Britain | Kevin McKenna,2009-08-01T23:05:05Z,Kevin McKenna,society
"Tomorrow's weather will be unsettled with bright intervals and showers interspersed with more prolonged periods of rain. The weekend will continue unsettled with a 65% chance of showers and further rain on Saturday. We listen uncomplaining to this drivel from one day to the next. We are British. Weather forecasting is like abstract art, any fool can do it once he has got the job. This week our spirits broke. We had been told by what passes for a government that this would be a warm summer, indeed a ""barbecue summer"". In the event, we had a decent June but a lousy July and a worse August is predicted. This is from the same people who said that both 2007 and 2008 would be ""warmer than average"", when they were cooler and wetter. They also said that any repeat this summer of the devastating rains of those two years was ""highly unlikely"". A new computer was reported to have run an ""ensemble forecast"" 41 times. It is probably the same computer as does defence ministry procurement, NHS records and ID cards. This is no laughing matter. Weather is serious money to some people. The American weather derivatives market, with its fancy hedge swaptions, straddles and ""costless collars"", was worth over $7bn before the credit crunch. Meanwhile, this year's forecasting fiasco has led to a 25% surge in last-minute holiday bookings abroad. I once sympathised with the BBC forecaster Michael Fish after he was roasted for telling the nation that the hurricane of 1987 would miss land and veer off in the direction of the Bay of Biscay or somewhere harmless. We all make mistakes. When I read Fish's defence of the ""barbecue summer"" in yesterday's Guardian, my sympathy lapsed. ""Grossly unfair,"" he said of any criticism. People should not complain when forecasts go wrong, as if that were a logical inevitability. Anyway, he added, there was a bit of sun during Wimbledon and Glastonbury. ""There is every chance"" that the remainder of the summer could be fine and ""contain really warm weather"". Curiously Fish added that the forecasts were really aimed at ""commercial organisations"", as if firms could be fobbed off with any rubbish. Besides, he said, the trouble lay with the media, ""who misinterpret the forecasts"", and the general public, who ""take more notice of the forecasts than they have in the past"". People should apparently ""learn to take pot luck"". We hear much talk about those who study English needing to be taught science. In my view, it is those who study science who need to be taught English. What is the point of public predictions so smothered in caveats and qualifiers as to be drained of significance? The same scientists who lecture ministers on the exactitude of their calling – on the purity of ""the science"" – use qualifiers that any English student could see render nouns worthless. Fish excuses his colleagues with weakening words such as chance, might, could, possibly, probably and even pot luck. Yet he is supposed to tell us what is going to happen. If these people cannot do so, and keep getting their predictions wrong, I see no point in paying them a salary. I was always told that you cannot predict summer weather in Britain. My early holidays on Cardigan Bay were enlivened by my father given a running commentary on the titanic struggle between ""a depression off Iceland"" and ""an anticyclone off the Azores"", as if it were Arsenal v Chelsea. Between this Scylla and Charybdis flows the Gulf Stream. As it collides with the complex profile of the British Isles, it generates the south-westerlies that pummel the coast all summer. The result is lost in chaos theory, vulnerable to a butterfly in Greenland or a leatherback in the Caribbean. Yet whenever criticised, the Met Office pleads for more staff, more research and a bigger computer. It is like burning pound notes in a gale. The office now claims that it is ""66% certain"" that next winter will be warmer and wetter than last. The figure is an ominously precise advance on the 65% certainty of a warm summer. The information is useless without knowing the likelihood of the ""66%"" being correct. Since for three years the Met Office has been plain wrong, a shrewd hedge manager would put the likelihood at zero and bet 100% against it. Indeed, the best news of the week is that the Met Office thinks August will be wet. I should buy sun cream futures. The purveyors of British weather forecasts are relentlessly upbeat in the long term and gloomy in the short, in other words they are probably political. There is rarely a weekend forecast that does not stress rain (or that curious synonym, showers) at the expense of sun, even if the rain falls, if at all, for a mere hour a day. Nor do forecasts favour coastal microclimates, which are mostly sunnier than inland and are where most holidaymakers go. A pub in my Welsh coastal village used to print out the BBC weather forecast each Friday – invariably ""rain in Wales"" – and put it on a board so visitors could hurl darts at it. The Scottish village of Carrbridge once threatened to sue the Met Office for a continually inaccurate forecast of rain that was ruining its tourist industry. Any gaze across the swamp of public information bears witness to the Arab saying that he who claims to know the future is a liar, even if proved right. The popular mathematician John Allen Paulos devoted most of his masterpiece – Innumeracy – not to algebra and geometry but to proportion and probability. Without understanding them, he said, we go mad. Today's political scaremongers, whether dealing with disease, terrorism, paedophilia, health and safety or the weather, seek to deny what Paulos called ""the irreducibly probabilistic nature of life"". They have lost all sense of proportion. In reality, wrote Paulos, ""giving due weight to the fortuitous … is a mark of maturity and balance"". The chance of a British soldier being a casualty in Helmand is in the order of one in 10, yet he is suffering to avert what is an infinitesimal risk, of a terrorism casualty on the streets of Britain. Millions of pounds of health spending are being diverted to swine flu, despite the chance of someone dying from it being far less than of the illnesses starved of funds as a result. There may be some value in a weather forecast in the American midwest, where it is reliable. But in Britain such forecasting is pseudo-science, what Isaac Asimov dismissed as ""a security blanket, a thumb to suck, a skirt to hold"". Like recent pandemic predictions, it is best left to the private sector, to insurers, astrologers, ball-gazers and seaweed. If Fish and his ilk want to run the streets naked and burble about showers, let them, but not at my expense. I have a Canadian stick outside my house that purports to predict the weather by turning up or down. I have learned its crafty ways. It moves, but only after the weather has already changed, thus telling me what I can see. It is cunning and beautiful. I love it.",The Met Office thinks August will be wet.

"In Edinburgh this weekend, you will find them seeking sanctuary in their coffee shops and their tea rooms while a thousand bekilted hairy arses lay waste to their golden city. For the last 10 years, they have ruminated, cogitated and disseminated. Are we experiencing a new Scottish enlightenment? they are constantly asking. What is modern Scotland? What does the rest of the world think of us? Do we look good in this? Do we call ourselves Caledonia, Scotia, Alba… or just plain old Scotland? Our self-styled intellectual elite has fed richly on the spoils of devolution and the serious newspapers have devoted acres of newsprint to accommodate their keening introspection. They write pamphlets and preach sermons. Scotland does not lead the world in heart attacks and knife crime, but in organising political conferences. But this weekend, they are cowering in their herbal infusions as the biggest clan gathering ever seen garrisons the capital city, the principal event in Homecoming Scotland 2009. They will resemble the figure in Munch's The Scream, but there are kilts and glengarry hats in the background. Ten years of wringing their hands and disclaiming loftily about Hume, Smith, Calman, oil, budget deficits and statehood and yet it all comes down to this: fat, bearded Nova Scotians running amok at the foot of Salisbury Crags swinging pretend claymores, making themselves sick on haggis and shortbread and dancing those jigs where they twirl their hands above their heads and shout: ""Wheech"" very suddenly. And as a dozen pipers play lone laments about the Highland clearances and the king across the water they will get drunk on whiskies that aren't called Johnny Walker. One Scotland, two nations. But what did we expect from something called Homecoming Scotland 2009? It was a brilliant idea to use this, the 250th anniversary of Robert Burns's birth, to reach out to the massive Scottish diaspora and ask them to consider coming home, if even just for a little while. The Irish did it in the last decade of the 20th century and have been congratulating themselves ever since for their simple boldness. In Scotland, on the other hand, we have tended to scoff at the homespun couthiness of it all. There will be too much tartan, we among the latteratti warned each other. There will be bagpipes and daft old codgers with New World dialects talking about pre-Jacobite clan rivalry in the Highlands. Yet is this something of which we should be ashamed? Look again at those tartan bampots in their silly hats and their buckled shoes. They are part of Scotland's greatest export: its people. Their families have helped maintain thousands of myths, legends and romances about Caledonia – about £2bn worth every year. If shortbread, heather, whisky, kilts, pibrochs, haggis, granny's hielan hame and the Loch Ness monster is what they want, then who are we to begrudge them? Thus far, the Homecoming project has been a qualified success, yet if it hadn't been administered by the bureaucratic undead that breed and have their being in the Scottish civil service, it would have been better. Is it all simply about packing as many impressionable expats into Highland guesthouses as humanly possible? Or is it also an opportunity to show these people when they get here that Scotland is about so much more than the lid of a shortbread tin. If so, why was VisitScotland handed sole responsibility for running the project and spending its money? There is currently a debate about whether this agency is already any good at its core business – attracting people to Scotland and ensuring that hotels and guesthouses are of a sufficient standard to bring them back. They have certainly failed to communicate what is the primary objective of Homecoming 2009. Is it all simply about filling beds? Or is it about making some successful Scots abroad consider relocating to the mother country? Modern Scotland, too, is a nation that thrums with artistic and cultural endeavour, yet this sector has virtually no influence on how Homecoming Scotland is delivered. It's not too late to review what we want Homecoming to do for this country. The final events of 2009 will take place around St Andrew's Day, 30 November. Under no circumstances, though, should the project end then. Homecoming should be ongoing and stretch well beyond the end of this year, perhaps for at least for another five years. It must come under the sole control of Mike Russell, Scotland's culture minister and the brightest politician that Holyrood has ever produced. (Does anyone know why it took nine long years for this country to choose a man in charge of setting an arts and cultural agenda who had actually seen an opera and a ballet and an exhibition at one of the national galleries?) He alone must be given the responsibility for setting the main objectives of Homecoming and personally selecting people of vision and ability from industry and commerce to make them happen. In Mr Russell's firmament, haggis, neeps and Harry Lauder must lie down with art, literature and Glasvegas. There must be drinking and the reading of poetry.",Homecoming Scotland 2009: Make this a party of all our talents | Kevin McKenna,2009-07-25T23:05:31Z,Kevin McKenna,uk
"Democracy works, however imperfectly. It is a commonplace that democracies make governments responsive to the peoples' wishes and demands. They allow for the argument, dissent and deliberation that produces better decision-making. But they do more. They have a capacity for self-correction, renewal and national reinvention. They express the deep wisdom of crowds. They force governments to confront today's economic and social realities with today's ideas and nostrums. British politics - and the country - faces a democratic conundrum. The universal consensus beyond Number 10 is that an exhausted Labour government is facing electoral disaster led by a man unsuited to the task of prime ministership. The Norwich byelection result is but a harbinger of the annihilation that is to come. Gordon Brown has a habitual capacity to overclaim and dissimulate. He believed his own propaganda about escaping boom and bust and bought the neoconservative ideology that financial markets were innovatively efficient, so helping stoke a wild credit boom, a failure he still does not publicly recognise. Worse, for a democratic politician, he is a lecturer and a bludgeoner rather than an arguer and a persuader. To argue, persuade and lead, you have to respect those with different views whether inside or outside your party. This is not his instinct; instead, he relies on a toxic inner circle to help him dispatch opponents by fair means or foul, as a lengthening list of able former colleagues is testimony. It is a tribute to the Labour party's death wish that it has not the courage to unseat such a leader. Other truths will surface over the next 10 months. The essence of democracy is alternative governments. After 13 years of New Labour, the country is ready for change. But the question it will and must ask is whether David Cameron's Conservatives are the answer to Britain's problems. To jump from the frying pan into the fire would be stupid. Brown, like the tortured heroes of Shakespearean tragedies, is complex: he has strengths that partly compensate for his all too obvious flaws. One strength is that he is assembling an array of policies that are right. This, along with his astonishing tenacity, makes it so hard for his party to junk him. And here's the rub. The country may find it has the same difficulty. One of the Conservative party's problems is that it does not have the intellectual, political and philosophical wind at its back and it has no surefooted sense of what it should do as the economic and social crisis unfolds. Thus Boris Johnson's London mayoralty in which little positive has been done. As somebody close to him acknowledged admiringly to me, Boris is the classic Tory. It is as important to occupy power, so denying its use to others, as to do anything constructive with it. That may excite Tory camp followers; others may feel that the point of power is to use it. The size of the prospective budget deficit has given the Tory leadership a new confidence. The Conservatives' task is to do what comes naturally: to take an axe to public spending and the regulatory arms of government like OfCom or the Financial Services Authority that displease the Tories' natural constituencies, whether Rupert Murdoch or a stage army of City traders. Yet under Adair Turner, the FSA has begun to get serious about insider trading, investment banker bonuses and the structure of banks' business models. Just as it gets its act together, it is to be disbanded and its powers handed to what City minister Paul Myners calls the ""bookish"" Bank of England, whose record of both spotting asset price bubbles and handling bank crises is dire. Thinking City people concerned about the dominance of speculative finance are shaking their heads in disbelief. Equally, Sky's competitors and many consumers are no less dismayed that a champion of competition is to be abolished.  Giles Wilkes, chief economist of the Liberal Democrat-leaning thinktank CentreForum, writes in an excellent overview of the current crisis (""A Balancing Act: Fair Solutions to a Modern Debt crisis"") that, while it was right to be tough on public spending and public deficits in 1979, it would be disastrous today. He argues that an economy beset by large private debt, low inflation, negligible private sector demand, collapsing asset prices and a broken banking system faces very different problems to the British economy of 1979. The growth in public debt that the Tories decry has been essential to heading off a full-blown depression.  It is tragic that Cameron and George Osborne have been seduced into primitive Samuel Smiles Thatcherism. They, like Brown, are more complicated than their cartoon depictions. Both have been brave enough to ask tough questions about the priorities of British capitalism and to have tried to open up a debate about how civil society as much as the state should address Britain's social problems. Now they have regressed to simple anti-state, budgetary conservatism at just the wrong moment. For over the last few weeks, the subterranean balance of the deep argument has begun to swing back to Brown. As Wilkes says, he got it wrong during the boom, but his fiscal strategy is now right. Brown's document, ""Building Britain's Future"", is only halfway there, but it is the right trajectory. It was an achievement to persuade both Nissan and Toyota to step up their investment in electric car batteries and hybrids in Britain. It is right to begin the electrification of the railways. He is right to defend the FSA. Although much criticised, Britain must afford the big deficits until the economy plainly bottoms, when it will be right both to raise taxes and then slow spending growth. But not until then. Brown is right to insist there is a fundamental difference of strategy and Osborne and Cameron would have been cleverer not to have allowed this gap to open. Will they really risk intensifying recession? Will they risk a second financial crisis that would bankrupt the country by mismanaging financial regulation? Do they have a strategy for building the economy? Will Britain leave the EU? These are big questions and in democracies cannot be avoided. If Labour was led by a charismatic leader sure of his or her ground, it would beat this Conservative party. Even with Brown, the Tory margin of victory cannot be taken for granted. There is a deep wisdom in democracies. They tend not to elect governments who will do the wrong things.","At last, Brown is getting it right.

"In the summer of 1977, I formally became a Scottish aficionado of the England Test cricket team. It is not a big club, yet not as small as you might imagine. Think of members of the Temperance Society who are also members of the Tartan Army. It happened simply because my new school chum, Gary, had developed a major enthusiasm for cricket, having lived in England for the previous 10 years. In those lovely June days, he suggested dodging school for a couple of weeks to watch England vs Australia for the Ashes. What was there not to like about such a notion? And so I learnt about the tiny urn wherein those hallowed ashes are interred. And I was told of the blessed Geoffrey Boycott, whom all of middle England despised yet would become an ideal role model for Scots who wanted to like cricket: blunt, cussed, a lover of rectitude in matters fiscal. England duly reclaimed the Ashes as Boycott claimed his 100th 100 at Headingley in his home county of Yorkshire and Ian Botham made his Test debut. I felt a little heady at the sophistication of it all and the prospect of a double life stretched out before me with an enticing smile. For during the dark winter months I could be all guttural, uncouth and full of super-lager while watching the Celtic. And in the summer I could wear pastels, modulate my glottals and sip Bacardis (you still can't get Pimm's in Scotland) while discussing Mike Brearley's increasingly eccentric field placings. The idyll of these late-Seventies summer Xanadus couldn't last. Reality kicked in and the inevitable question had to be asked: why are Scotland shite at cricket too? The Marxist/Tam the Bam theory for this diurnal question is an interesting one. It holds that while aristocratic, English generals in the British army were inventing the game and teaching it to their subcontinental man-servants miles behind the front line of another land-grabbing war, the Scots were actually fighting the war and so were never introduced to the ethereal intensity of this most anointed of sporting pastimes. Like many of the other theories of Tam the Bam and Marx though, it sounded brilliant but didn't really bear a lot of scrutiny. Here's the reality. Scots are not shite at cricket and indeed tens of thousands of us have been playing the game for around 200 years - the way it was meant to be played. There are more cricketers in Aberdeenshire than in Yorkshire and, per head of population, more Scots play the game regularly than the English. But when Greed, Envy and Avarice, those three horsemen of capitalism, began to gather over the English greensward, a pale rider called Professionalism followed with them and the essential goodness of English cricket was destroyed forever. In Scotland, whole villages up and down the east coast gather weekly to watch their local heroes, refulgent in their whites, fight nobly for the honour of their community against rival yeomanry. In 1985, one of these villages, Freuchie, won the hallowed Village Cup at Lord's. The entire population of this Fife community decamped to cricket's Mecca to witness their stout-hearted sportsmen. The author of a book about these fabled exploits, Neil Drysdale, is one of Scotland's finest sportswriters. Thousands of us were transfixed on the final day of the first Test in Cardiff as England and Australia provided the finest piece of sporting endeavour anywhere in the UK this year. And that is why nationalist MSP Sandra White was wrong to chastise the BBC for devoting so much news time to progress reports on the Test. Scots don't like cricket, she said. Yes we do, Ms White, yes we do. And we play it in its purest form.",Cricket at its purest is only found in Scotland | Kevin McKenna,2009-07-18T23:01:00Z,Kevin McKenna,uk
"The first time I saw Barack Obama in the flesh was at Kingstree High School in South Carolina. It was January 2008, early in the presidential campaign, when people were still not quite sure what to make of the ""skinny guy with the funny name,"" as he called himself. The crowd there were mainly African-American, which marked a change after the almost all-white audiences of Iowa and New Hampshire. It also represented Obama's first chance to reassure hitherto-sceptical black Americans that he was, indeed, one of their own. In his manner, in his speaking style, he demonstrated just that – and swiftly. ""I need you not only to vote, but I need you to get cousin Pookie to vote,"" he said, with a smile. ""I need Ray-Ray to vote."" Anyone who ever doubted whether Obama was ""black enough"" left Kingstree that morning with no such doubts. But the candidate did not just tickle his audience's tummy. He told them some uncomfortable truths too. He told black fathers they needed to stay with their children, that parents needed to help their kids with their schoolwork, that black America needed to offer role models besides rappers and athletes. I've been thinking of that morning in Kingstree after reading the speech Obama gave last night to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, America's premier civil rights organisation. It was yet another stirring address – though we're getting used to those. But it also adopted the shape that now seems to characterise some of Obama's most effective speeches and which was on display, if only in outline, all those months ago in South Carolina. First, the president stresses his solidarity with and affinity for his audience. To the NAACP, that came through a powerful attack on America's long history of racism and his admission that that is far from being in the past: ""the pain of discrimination is still felt in America,"" he said. That empathy came with a lot of practical talk on remedies, in employment, education and healthcare. Once solidarity is established, Obama then feels able to tell some home truths. Yesterday that echoed Kingstree very directly:   To parents, we can't tell our kids to do well in school and fail to support them when they get home. For our kids to excel, we must accept our own responsibilities. That means putting away the Xbox and putting our kids to bed at a reasonable hour. It means attending those parent-teacher conferences, reading to our kids, and helping them with their homework.  And this:   They might think they've got a pretty good jump shot or a pretty good flow, but our kids can't all aspire to be the next LeBron or Lil Wayne. I want them aspiring to be scientists and engineers, doctors and teachers, not just ballers and rappers.  Imagine a white president saying these things. He either wouldn't dare or, if he did, it would sound like finger-wagging and hectoring, whose motives would always be suspect. People might well accuse such a president of racist bias, playing on a stereotype of black youth as ""ballers and rappers"". But Obama does not face that obstacle. He is addressing black America from within. He can speak of ""our children"" and ""our communities"" and mean it. And people are prepared to take criticism from within – from one of their own – that they would never tolerate from an outsider. Obama used that fact to his advantage when addressing African leaders earlier this month. ""I have the blood of Africa within me,"" he told them – before launching a stern lecture on corruption and civil war, adding that Africans could not blame their former imperial masters for all their woes. Yesterday he offered the NAACP a variation of the same theme:   Your destiny is in your hands, and don't you forget that. That's what we have to teach all of our children! No excuses! No excuses!  He even used that approach in his landmark speech to the Muslim world last month: My middle name is Hussein, I have Muslims in my family, I have reverence for the Islamic faith – but here's where you are going wrong. It is this ability, to speak to a range of constituencies his predecessors would have found out of reach – and to speak to those constituencies from within – that sets Obama apart. And which means his presidency still retains the chance to be transformational.",Barack Obama spoke to the NAACP from within | Jonathan Freedland,2009-07-17T13:00:31Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"So Dick Cheney was right. In the end, the Iraqi people did respond to American soldiers with flowers. The only trouble was, it was their shipping out, not their digging in, that the Iraqi people celebrated. Today, as US forces marked their formal withdrawal from the towns and cities they invaded more than six years ago, the Iraqi people showed the kind of spontaneous joy the former vice-president once imagined would welcome the 173rd Airborne Brigade. There were streamers and balloons, pop concerts in the park and, yes, flowers – garlanding the abandoned checkpoints of the US military in petals. Now, as Iraq recedes, it is the country next door that looms ever larger. Handled the wrong way, Iran threatens to define Barack Obama the way Iraq defined George W Bush. There are some who believe Bush's mistake was not to have shifted his aim eastward: that if he was looking for an oil-rich state in the Persian Gulf with links to terrorism and dreams of weapons of mass destruction then Iran, not Iraq, should have been his target. That kind of talk makes others nervous. They fear that the US might one day repeat the Iraq calamity, with the ayatollahs cast in the role of Saddam Hussein. Those worriers will hardly find it comforting that the men who agitated for invasion in 2003 are back on the warpath once more: Paul Wolfowitz castigated Obama in the Washington Post earlier this month for taking ""a neutral posture"" towards the street protesters in Iran, calling on the president to throw all his prestige behind the uprising and against the regime. He wasn't calling for regime change in Tehran, exactly, but Wolfowitz spoke about Iran's rulers the same way he once spoke about Saddam. Is that a sign of things to come? Put simply, have the events of the last three weeks in Tehran made the prospect of US-led action against Iran – up to and including the use of military force – more or less likely? At first glance, those advocating regime change seem to have had a boost. The world has just watched a three-week infomercial exposing the brutality of Iran's leaders. If it's not allegations of a stolen election, including the black comedy of Monday's announcement from the Guardian Council that, yes, there had been an error in the count and therefore Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's vote would be revised upward – it's the violence that has followed. One western diplomat says opinion in the chancelleries of Europe has hardened, even among those once well-disposed towards Tehran: ""They have seen the face of this regime – and it's not pretty."" What's more, those eager for confrontation might find an all too willing partner in Iran's rulers. Professor Ali Ansari, a noted authority on the country, predicts that a regime that now ""suffers from a serious domestic legitimacy problem – and which knows it – will seek a foreign foe, something to rally the country around."" He predicts ""acts of provocation"", and only hopes Israel is wise enough not to take the bait. Above all, those pushing for regime change could find international public opinion more receptive than it would have been a month ago. Three weeks of YouTube footage, including the blood-spattered image of Neda Soltan, the female protester shot dead in cold blood, has surely created a well of public sympathy from which any advocate of action against the mullahs could draw. One can imagine the arguments as, in 2011, President Obama, backed by his loyal ally Prime Minister Cameron of Britain, addresses the United Nations demanding a united show of strength to save the benighted people of Iran. But the events of the last few weeks could point in the opposite direction too. Officially the US and UK say they want a change in policy, not regime – and, despite everything, that door is not closed. Indeed, it's possible that the supreme leader's Mugabe-like attacks on Britain – casting London and the BBC as the puppet masters behind the uprising – are a diversionary tactic by an elite that does not want to attack the US. Yes, Ali Khamenei has slammed Britain – but he has pointedly failed to rebuff Obama's outstretched hand. In other words, a policy change by Iran is still possible. But the deeper point relates to public sentiment, especially in the US. Seven years ago, Bush cast Iran as part of the ""axis of evil"", a faraway, abstract place clothed in black and bent on destruction. Now the world's people have read Iranians tweeting, minute by minute, on their aching desire for freedom. They have heard that Tehranis climb each night on to their rooftops to shout ""God is great"" – a subversive reminder to Khamenei that he is outranked by another supreme leader. They have seen, at last, that Iranians have a human face. In this, an unexpected but eloquent source has been, of all things, Comedy Central's satirical Daily Show. Incredibly, the programme had its own correspondent in Iran. Brilliantly sending up the grammar of flak-jacketed TV reporters, he has been ushering real Iranians into American living rooms – listening in mock frustration as they refuse to conform to the stereotype, telling him: ""We don't hate Jews, we don't hate Americans, we don't hate anybody."" Even the goatherd in a remote village shows a stunning knowledge of US geography; a market trader correctly identifies the US speaker of the House. As anchor Jon Stewart put it on the eve of the election: ""The evil, despotic, apocalyptic death cult we know as Iran appears to be one of the more vibrant democracies in the Middle East."" Of course, educated folk will insist they have long been familiar with Iran's human face. They will point to art exhibitions such as Made in Iran, now in London, or Iran Inside Out in New York, movies including the new Shirin and the much-admired Persepolis, or memoirs such as Reading Lolita in Tehran. What's different about the last few weeks, however, is that this exposure to the complexity, variety and sheer humanness of Iran's people has become mainstream. This could cut both ways. Some Europeans and Americans might feel such empathy for the green revolutionaries that they join the neocon call and demand their governments act to rescue the Iranians from tyranny. But it's more likely that many would recoil from a shock and awe bombardment that would kill thousands of the very people for whom they now have a strong affinity. There was, alas, too little feeling for the peoples of Iraq and Afghanistan: they were always faceless, even in death. All of which leaves Obama engaged in delicate diplomatic footwork. He must stand up for democracy, condemning the suppression in Iran as ""outrageous"", even as he gives the ayatollahs no excuse to crack down on the protesters as foreign agents, and all the while ensuring the western offer to Iran of rapprochement in return for compromise remains on the table. It is subtle work. But now that the world's people have seen the human face of Iran, nothing less will do. The street protesters of Tehran may have failed to topple their rulers. But in this – in showing the world that the people of Iran are human beings, not collateral damage in waiting – they have been a glorious success.","Now we have seen Iran's human face, a military attack is unthinkable | Jonathan Freedland",2009-06-30T19:30:00Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"The first problem with this book is its title. There is no prospect of China ruling the world. This is a country whose uncertainties of identity and economic frailties prevent it from ever projecting hegemonic hard and soft power. Its authoritarian institutions, far from being a source of strength, are a source of weakness. China is simultaneously big but poor, powerful but weak. And there, until wholesale political change occurs, it will stay, notwithstanding its considerable growth rates and economic achievement. Indeed, its current economic model, dependent on high exports and mountainous savings, is disintegrating, as both insiders and close observers recognise. Martin Jacques partially acknowledges that economic problems exist even as he breathlessly rehearses the economically impossible extrapolations of China's recent growth far into the future. His intellectual difficulty is that he needs to make the grandiose claim that China will rule the world to drive home his interesting thesis that western-defined modernity - the belief in the marriage of democracy, Enlightenment values, capitalism and progress - is about to be contested seriously for the first time by a non-western power.  China is not a nation state, he writes, but a civilisation state. As such, it cannot make accommodations with others as it rises. It will be condemned to be true to its past; rather than submit to multilateral law and institutions, it will ""feel free to be what it thinks it is and act accordingly to its history and instincts which are those of a civilisation state"".  Historically, China has regarded itself as being at the centre of the world and has sought tribute from others as acknowledgement of its inherent superiority, a racism that is embedded in the Chinese psyche, Jacques argues provocatively. Its instincts remain essentially Confucian: a strong central state seeking benevolently and collectively to improve the condition of the people. Communism is a contemporary expression of Confucianism. This is the most eyecatching part of what is in essence another of the Beware China is coming, Asian values are superior books. However, the affinity between Confucianism and communism is hardly a new insight. Liu Shaoqi, one of the party's five leaders in the 1940s, drew a parallel between the self-discipline and self-cultivation needed to be a Confucian scholar and becoming an effective communist. Where Jacques scores is in arguing that it is Chinese civilisation, rather than the Communist party, that will drive China.  Yet the more I reflect on the idea of a civilisation state standing in tension with a conventional nation state, the less am I persuaded the distinction holds. Britain, France, Germany and the US are also civilisation states, defined as much by their different cultures and histories as their jurisdictional boundaries, languages and national assemblies. All in varying ways are creatures of the European Enlightenment; all can trace core values to republican Rome and the philosophers of Greece.  Western states frequently do not meet their own standards any more than China does. But I agree with Rousseau, Kant and Paine that all human beings have a sense of self and are thus worthy of equal respect as individuals, as I agree with Aristotle and Plato about the importance of due desert underpinning justice. There is a universal hunger for these values which does not stop at China's borders because of some mystical adherence to Asian values. We all want to live lives we have reason to value - whether we are Chinese or British. Indeed, the processes thrown up by the western tradition - the rule of law, the drive to experiment and innovate, the prevalence of free argument and exchange of ideas - also drive successful, long-term economic performance. China can approach the frontier of technological knowledge developed by others, but it has a limited capacity to get beyond it. It is deeply corrupt, deeply uninnovative, deeply environmentally wasteful and these deformations can be traced back to its lack of institutions rooted in Enlightenment values. China has no checks and balances; it needs them.  The great reforming revolutionary Sun Yat-Sen wanted them for China; the Tiananmen protesters in Beijing and other cities across China risked their lives for them; Charter 08, instigated by more than 300 Chinese intellectuals last December, campaigns for them; and the Chinese in Taiwan have succeeded partially in implanting them. Jacques's argument implies that Chinese workers don't want representation at work, nor Chinese shareholders any influence on company managements, nor Chinese citizens to hold their government to account. It is profoundly mistaken. The majority do want these things and the fact they don't have them holds China back.  China cannot build its economy for ever on a savings rate of 40 per cent of GDP, or exports growing at such a rate that by 2020 they will constitute half of the world's merchandise exports. The model is cracking because it must. China must save less and consume more, as Jacques acknowledges.  But it will not make the transition without political change. The Chinese save because they do not trust the future. They know the Communist party's grip is unsustainable. The real story of the next generation will be of the west drawing ahead of a China facing political turmoil and increasing economic difficulties. The problem we will have to manage is not China ruling the world. It will be of bridging the already high and growing gap between the west and the rest. Martin Jacques's extensive research is marred by the book's central thesis. He is too suspicious of the west to offer real insight into the future. • Will Hutton is the author of The Writing on the Wall: China and the West in the 21st Century (Abacus)",Review: When China Rules the World by Martin Jacques,2009-06-20T23:01:00Z,Will Hutton,review
"Gorbals Mick. It betrayed every single fear and prejudice of the feral, aristocratic English underclass. And it was safe to assume that those who gloried in Michael Martin's nickname had never visited this benighted little district that lies just south and a little bit east of the River Clyde. We knew that when the children of the southern shires misbehaved, their parents would tell them that their dreams would be haunted by ghouls, hobgoblins and the Gorbals Bogeyman. ""Gorbals"". It is a word that, when uttered, carries menace and a challenge. In the dark imaginings of the children of the shires, it is a place where the sun does not shine and where birdsong has departed. Where men spend their days working in foundries and their nights in desolate taverns called O'Shaughnessy's or Finbarr's. Babies are abandoned at birth in the Spartan fashion and dogs are eaten. At weekends, people are chibbed. If they are lucky, they may simply be banjoed. The women wear shawls, the burkas of the labouring classes. The old age pension kicks in at 35 and the Styx runs past it. When some of those Nigels, Quentins and Geoffreys grew up, they still bolted the door at night and trembled at childhood memories of the Gorbals Bogeyman. And they all remember what they were doing on the day the nightmare became reality, 23 October 2000. The day Gorbals Mick stepped out of their dreams, knocked on the door of their House and came in to terrorise them. They formed a support group where they shared their terrors of the night and every month they ventured forth in hoods and fiery crosses to bait and worry the Frankenstein's monster who had now taken residence in the Speaker's chair in the Palace of Westminster. Last month, their nine-year-long campaign to oust Michael Martin finally ended in victory and, ever since, the air above Westminster has been rent with their braying and their snorting. They had finally killed the beast. But for those nine years when Martin administered his duties as Speaker of the House effectively and with wisdom, the slab was pulled back off the grass and we saw what class prejudice in the 21st century really looked like. At first, there was merely a grim fascination at the grating sound of a working man's voice. They struggled with the shortened vowels and the distended consonants of this dialect from the Black Lagoon and so they turned to each other and said: ""He's not very bright, is he?""  Soon, there were unsourced reports from shadowy figures that Speaker Martin was struggling with the Byzantine procedures of the House. Of course it was all going to end in tears. After all, the chap didn't even have a degree. Then there were reports of bullying of his staff, who were described as vestigial figures of a hallowed disposition whose only desire had only ever been to serve Merrie Englande for a hearty jug of porter and a suckling pig at Christmas. This uncouth Glaswegian tyrant was allegedly making their lives hell. It was all simply intolerable. And Mrs Martin? Just who did she think she was? Brazenly shopping in Knightsbridge stores and claiming for her taxis. Didn't she know there was a waiting list for noses in the trough and that you had to be proposed and seconded by the men in the velvet smoking jackets? But they knew their day would come and when the moats, the duckhouses and the trouser-presses were revealed, they seized their chance. As a collection of dreadful little Liberal Democrats and Tory backwoodsmen lined up to condemn him they knew they had him. For Speaker Martin, they all knew, we all knew, simply didn't have the intellectual tools and the quick wit to see off the barbs and the catcalls. In the end, he made it easy for them simply because he loved this House and its traditions and procedures and he knew that by fighting them he risked opprobrium coming down on all of it. He might also have expected some succour from his leader, a man to whom he had always given loyal and unstinting support. But the stoney stare and the unforgiving jowls told him all he needed to know: that loyalty only works one way in Gordon Brown's inner sanctum. No matter that he had given all of them a classic opportunity to save themselves last year with commonsense proposals to begin the process of reforming how their expenses worked. They had rejected these and with that their last chance of self-preservation had gone. Now, by falling on him, they knew they could give themselves some respite from the Telegraph's onslaught. Many of his brother MPs even took time off from their day jobs in the boardrooms of private equity firms to turn up and see the fun. Michael Martin will return to Glasgow with his head held high. For he served his party and his country with distinction. When he left an old Catholic secondary school in 1960, he lacked qualifications, money, help and influential friends. But he still made it to the pinnacle of the British ruling establishment and his constituents in Springburn were proud of him because he still looked like them, talked like them and he was proud to represent them. At the byelection in September, they may yet punish the Labour party for allowing one of their own to twist in the wind before a pack of Tory hyenas.",The south never got Michael Martin | Kevin McKenna,2009-06-20T23:01:00Z,Kevin McKenna,politics
"It's so hard to keep a sense of ­proportion with MPs' expenses. Let's take as a wild for-instance Lembit Opik's kerazy wig, bought at a taxpayer cost (can we just ­assume outraged italics, from now on, where the word ""taxpayer"" ­occurs? It will save me so much effort) of £19.99. It was apparently for a charity appearance, in which he wanted to appear more fun. So of course this is outrageous – who needs a wig to look fun, when they are engaged to an international singing twin? Plus, surely he could have borrowed her hotpants? Then there's all the outrage that he couldn't have paid for his stupid headware himself, that if he was going to lig off the taxpayer, couldn't he have just ligged a donation to the charity (that's what Ed Balls did, when – this is actually true – he put in a claim for £58.70 to be the ball sponsor for Ossett Town AF and Social Club. I mean, it's nuts. But at least it didn't go to him, at least it landed in Ossett). Sorry, where was I? Oh yeah, craziness! Wig! Outrage! But it's only 20 quid, says my teeny voice of reason. And he probably had to spend a whole Saturday in a stupid wig. OK, move on: something more mainstream than a, let's be honest, somewhat singular and special interest Liberal. Why are they all allowed to claim for Sky? What can they possibly be watching that they couldn't see on the BBC? Well, Adam Boulton is handsome. And the misspelt banners of news are often exciting, but other channels catch up fast. I feel like, if I put my mind to it, I could foment a joint outrage about taxpayers' money going on Sky, on the one hand, when they could make do with the BBC, which they've already paid for with taxpayers' money, never mind the taxpayers' money we've spent before we even got their expenses in the first place. And now I am too out of breath to express how insanely petty-minded I have become. Who cares who spent what on a pasta bake and whether or not you're allowed to claim for a dressing gown? When did I turn into this person? Who cares about David Chaytor paying his daughter under an assumed name many thousands of pounds? Oh, yes, I do care. That does actually sound quite dodgy. Do you see what I mean, though? It's so hard to rein yourself in. So let's make some rules: you can only get proper outrage if it's your own MP. My MP is Kate Hoey. As an inner London MP, she doesn't have a second home. I have no idea how much she spends in Tesco, or whether there is any onyx in her home fitments. Not only is she apparently not on the make, she appears to be getting ripped off by other people. Nobody's mobile phone bill should come to £230 in one month. Surely she's on the wrong tariff? Otherwise, all she buys is paperclips. Endless paperclips, as far as the accounting eye can see. Once in a blue moon, when she really wants to kick up her heels, some Post-It notes. OK, so what about Martin Linton (he is my ex-MP, also inner London, so also without embarrassment). He makes Hoey and Harriet Harman look good, because he charges for newspapers and they don't. But he used to work for the Guardian. So maybe it's loyalty to a dying media. He has a payment to a Jill McSweeney (consultant) who, amazing, is the only name in the world without any results on Google. I personally think it's a pseudonym for a voice coach, but if I spend any more time checking that, I will have to concede that I'm being petty-minded again. It's 500 quid. Even if it's for chest-hair implants, it is not a great threat to the nation's democracy. Right, focus the righteous anger on all the redactions and we might get somewhere. I love a scandal that involves a new word. I haven't felt this enlightened since extraordinary rendition. With so much blacked out, you have to wonder about the embarrassing stuff left in – you know, why admit the horse manure, the chap you got round to attach your scart lead even though you're supposed to be minister for technology? Does that mean the stuff blacked out is more shaming? Or are half these people too idle, not just to remove their own wasp nests, but to do their own redacting? Are we dealing with sloth or corruption? Nope, no good. I'm all outraged out. Have an incredibly pricey (£1,295) bookshelf on me, Ann Clwyd. Who knows? You probably deserve it.","I'm outraged!

"So there are limits to the magician's powers. For a ­moment there, when the footage from Tehran showed young women wearing Victoria Beckham sunglasses, peroxide hair poking from their hijabs, lining up to cast their votes in a record turnout election, it looked as if Iran was about to end the sullen estrangement of the last four years, turf out Mahmoud ­Ahmadinejad and present a new, more open face to the world. If that had been the outcome of Iran's election, it would have been notched up, in part, as an early triumph for Barack Obama: his ­allies would have declared that the hand the president stretched out to the Muslim world in Cairo less than a fortnight ago had unclenched the Iranian fist. That's not how it turned out. Instead, the US president today surveys a Middle Eastern landscape that has changed over a single weekend, thanks to what looks like a stolen election in Tehran and a policy climbdown by the prime minister of Israel. These shifts raise searching questions about Obama's entire approach to foreign policy – and suggest that at least one key aspect of it is not working. The at-a-glance view says Obama has been relying on the familiar combination of carrots and sticks: carrots for Iran, in the form of dialogue, respect and personal video messages bursting with praise for Iranian civilisation; and sticks for Israel, sharpened into explicit, no-wriggle-room demands to end ­settlement building on the West Bank. In this view, Obama should conclude that carrots don't work but sticks do – the latter prodding Binyamin Netanyahu to utter, at long last, the words ""Palestinian state"", even if the phrase emerged from his mouth, as one Israeli commentator put it, like a rotten tooth pulled without anaesthesia. He put the squeeze on Bibi and got results, he made nice to Tehran and got nothing. Time to draw the obvious conclusion. But it might not be quite as simple as that. Start with Iran. It's true that the Obama administration had hoped that its policy of engagement – after the outer darkness treatment of the Bush years – would bring change. If the election results were legitimate, it would mean the Iranian people had heard Obama's honeyed rhetoric and were unmoved. That is not totally ludicrous: two US non-profit organisations ran an extensive, scientific opinion poll in Iran last month and did indeed find Ahmadinejad walloping his opponents. But what if there was fraud? It certainly seems likely, given the freakish nature of some of the numbers, complete with Ahmadinejad outpolling his rivals even in their own home towns. If he, and the hardline clerical authorities whom he serves as frontman, did indeed steal the election, that confirms the nature of the regime Obama confronts. It also exposes the US president to the charge, already voiced on the right, that he was naive to think he could engage meaningfully with what is nothing more than a theocratic dictatorship. The US administration has its ­counter-arguments ready. For one thing, the policy of dialogue was conceived on the assumption that Ahmadinejad would be a two-term president. True, one senior administration official confessed to me today, some in the White House began to believe they were about ""to catch a break"" in Iran as they saw the excitement the opposition Mousavi campaign was generating: they dared to hope they were about to see a repeat of this month's Lebanese elections in which the pro-western coalition defeated Hezbollah and its allies. But that feeling did not last long. Nor are Washington's policymakers feeling queasy about dialogue with a nation that lays on an outward show of democracy – complete with rallies and debates – only to crush dissent brutally when the people vote the wrong way. Such scruples have not prevented the US dealing with China, Russia, Saudi Arabia or a long list of others. As Obama explained repeatedly through the 2008 campaign, he does not believe diplomacy is a reward for good behaviour, but a tool to advance America's self-interest. But it's not one Washington will deploy indefinitely. ""We'll see if it bears fruit,"" says that official. ""If it doesn't then, at some point, we'll have to try something else. It's not without limit."" When might US patience run out? The answer is the end of this year: after that, western diplomats believe Tehran will reach the nuclear point of no return, when no one will be able to prevent it acquiring the bomb. In this context, Team Obama can even spot an upside to Ahmadinejad's re-election. First, there's a Nixon-to-China calculation that says Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, would only feel confident enough to reach an accommodation on nukes if he was secure at home: he couldn't afford a reformist president vulnerable to accusations of treachery from the right. Second, Tehran might feel the need to offset the charge of election fraud with a reputation-redeeming gesture, softening the nuclear line. Should that not come, and Obama decides to replace diplomacy with something stronger, his chances of marshalling an international coalition will have been boosted: Washington expects to hear fewer arguments defending Iran's nuclear quest as the legitimate interest of a legitimate government. All of which adds up to a ­conclusion that it is far too early to declare the Obama outreach to Iran a failure. The policy will continue for another six months, if only so that, should Iran eventually show Washington the finger, Obama can say what Bush never could: that he tried to do it the nice way. What of Netanyahu? Here too nothing is quite as simple as it looks. Yes, the stick brought success, in that Bibi is now technically committed to a two-state ­solution. But the promise came laden with caveats and qualifiers: such a state must be demilitarised, with no control over its own airspace and foreign ­alliances, and will come about only if Palestinians first recognise Israel as the state of the Jewish people. All this was offered with no empathy for the Palestinians, none of the language deployed when Ariel Sharon and Ehud Olmert made their own reversals on Palestinian statehood – speeches that conveyed the sense of men who had made a difficult journey towards recognition of the other. Netanyahu's was grudging, the words of a man doing the minimum necessary to get a demanding US president off his back. ""The Americans see through that ruse,"" says the US-based analyst Daniel Levy, who does not expect Obama to ease the pressure on settlements just because Bibi has dared speak of a two-state solution. But there are opportunities here, too. Netanyahu lodged his objections to a Palestinian state solely in terms of Israeli security. Obama could respond to that, says Levy, by offering whatever Israel needs to allay its fears – even a Nato-led protection force, if that's what it takes. Netanyahu has framed the conflict in such a way as to give serious leverage to Obama. This dramatic June weekend has set a test of the American president's resolve. Will he stick to his course, continuing to reach out to Iran even as he shows tough love to Israel? He should, partly to show that his policy was always about long-term strategy rather than short-term tactics. But also because the last 48 hours offer plenty of evidence that he's getting it right.

"Reforming the City of London - as with any powerful vested interest - takes both political courage and intellectual conviction. I have often privately wondered whether this comes more easily to Tory than Labour politicians. The votes from the people behind the tens of thousands of small and medium businesses who would benefit, along with the managers of the dozens of new great plcs such as Rolls-Royce which would be created, would disproportionately be Conservative - a powerful incentive. Moreover, Labour ministers and their officials have a reflex deference to rich Oxbridge types who argue that City interests must come before all others. Tories are less in awe. They were at school with many of them, and know them for what they are - seekers of economic rent, of moderate intellect, and bestowed with a vastly inflated view of their own worth. One of the more painful truths of Labour governments - from Ramsay MacDonald through to Tony Blair and Gordon Brown - is that they are in thrall to finance. For MacDonald that meant holding on to the gold standard; for Harold Wilson and Jim Callaghan, trying to avoid devaluation for too long; and for Gordon Brown it has involved acting as an apostle for light-touch financial regulation and big finance. The City owes Brown big time. He defended tax havens, buried the Cruickshank report arguing for curbs on profiteering, conceded a minimalist bank deposit insurance scheme, and under-resourced the Financial Services Authority, instructing it to keep regulation light. The policy objective was to make sure that the global shadow banking system, in which non-bank financial institutions play a growing role in lending funds, was based in London. So no mechanism for regulating derivatives trading was proposed - or for monitoring how banks gamble on the markets using their own funds. This was to be the world's largest casino. When the dam broke last October, it was clear to some in the Treasury negotiating team who were trying frantically to stave off a disastrous collapse of the banking system that Barclays should be forced to participate, along with RBS and Lloyds, in the recapitalisation plan. This was in order to avoid a subsequent two-tier banking system. The Bank of England even wanted £120bn injected into the banks rather than the £50bn that was finally decided upon, but again the bankers resisted the greater state ownership. The veto on the Treasury team's plan came from the top - even while contingency plans were being made for a bank holiday on the Monday if the run on the banks continued, so great was the crisis. The establishment of UK Financial Investments Limited to hold the taxpayers stake at arm's length with the aim of returning the bailed-out banks to the markets to resume where they left off was another capitulation to City interests. But while Labour seems to be content to be the City's creature, it is shadow chancellor George Osborne who has emerged as a critic of City short-termism. ""If we are to build a truly new British economic model we need to address some persistent and deep-rooted weaknesses,"" he said in a speech last week. ""Our long-term priority is to refocus our economy from short-term gains to long-term returns."" British innovation, research and development, and physical infrastructure are poorer than in comparable countries. Osborne has also at last understood that reform is not about excessive state control or abandoning free trade - the usual accusations thrown at financial system reformers. It is about finding a matrix of nudges, incentives, reforms and new institutions that in his words creates ""a financial system that measures returns over many years and decades, not just quarters"". He is right to argue that extravagant short-term bonuses reward short-term performance - and to warn banks not to pay them. Moreover, as he says, the banking system is far too concentrated; Britain needs a spread of regionally based, specialist banks - and the disposal of government stakes gives the opportunity to create them. It also needs institutions who value investment in long-term assets and technologies. This is not a bad start. We need more - a holistic approach to reforming the entire system. We need nudges to get pension fund trustees to value long-term investment, obligations on non-executive directors to champion long-termism; fewer takeovers financed by cheap debt; less emphasis on high dividends; and tougher controls on the whole shadowland of financial derivatives. But Osborne has opened up an important debate, even if on mainstream fiscal policy he is resolutely conservative. Note that Gordon Brown has not made one such speech in 12 years in government: indeed, on the one occasion a radical plan to encourage new investors in industry was proposed in autumn 2000 by then business secretary Stephen Byers - a knowledge bank - Brown killed the idea stone dead. It was crucial as a ""dividing line"" to show that he was pro City - despite the proven need. The economics Nobel prize winner Professor Paul Krugman predicts in an interview I did with him (see Business, pages 6 and 7) that the world economy is threatened by ""Nipponisation"" - everyone suffering from Japan's inability to stimulate demand in an economy whose consumers and businesses are crippled by debt. It is all too easy to imagine, he says, balance sheet constraints meaning that western economies bump along the bottom for years. An apocalyptic prospect of depression may have receded; instead we risk a long period of stagnation. In which case reform of the financial system will be crucial to lift investment and innovation. This has been a long-standing personal conviction - Osborne even cites me along with Rolls-Royce's CEO Sir John Rose as two people who have consistently made the argument. But we need more people to say publicly what they say in private and support a politician kite-flying an argument of crucial national interest. I know any number of CEOs, entrepreneurs and even some City refuseniks who agree. But when the Financial Times runs a front-page story about City concerns that London will give in to Brussels demands for more financial regulation, as it did last week, there is the same dreary rent-a-quote from whoever is chair of the City of London's Policy and Resources Committee saying nothing must be done to damage the City's competitiveness. Paul Krugman repeated his praise of what Brown did last autumn - and was upbeat about Britain's short-term economic prospects. But he also says that on fiscal policy Brown lost his nerve. He could have said the same of City reform. Labour has just months to show it will not be outflanked by George Osborne. I hope that even at the last it finds some guts.",It's the Conservatives who are now promising real reform in the City | Will Hutton,2009-06-13T23:01:00Z,Will Hutton,politics
"It has such a stupid name, it doesn't actually sound like software: it sounds like a deliberate attempt to mock a totalitarian government that tries to use software; like someone's brought George Orwell back from the dead (just one more job, mate …); nevertheless, the Chinese government is pretty serious about its Green Dam Youth Escort package, through which it aims to control individual access to porn sites on the internet. A press ­release on Monday detailed three Chinese ­computer companies who had vouched to pre-install the software (no foreign ones as yet), and said it had already been installed in 52.7m units. The immediate worry, reported by this newspaper's correspondent in Beijing, Jonathan Watts, is that it will be used to restrict access to dissident sites, not just pornographic ones. He elaborated: ""What they have at the moment is a fairly crappy, easy to uninstall piece of software. But you have to remember that this is stage one, once you enable the authorities to censor at machine level, the software will get better and better. So my feeling is that this is an attempt to shore up the great firewall which doesn't work a lot of the time."" Chinese bloggers are currently concentrating on that crappy aspect: it is a terrible programme, apparently, with a hair-trigger that blocks access on the basis of innocuous phrases like ""touch-ball"", unsophisticated enough to block not just pornography but all news articles that mention pornography. There are also sinister rumours ­surrounding the collection of personal information on people who try to access banned sites: the worry being, again, that this has nothing to do with ­pornography, this is about putting in place the technology to control all ­computers, and all users, to the point where the would-be dissident has no safe way to use the internet at all. And yet it's possible that the government is on the level, that pornography is the target. The immediate impulse with Chinese legislation of this sort is always to look to political freedoms being encroached upon. I would suggest three reasons for this: first, if we were just to take at face value the impulse to control access to internet pornography, it wouldn't look so radically different to that proposed by the Australian Labour party last year. Sure, China moves faster and is somewhat less receptive to criticism, but the methods are the same, and so indeed is the rhetoric – stress the dangers to children, ask yourselves, ­citizens, whether you wouldn't do anything to protect the innocent, and if not, why not, you pervert? It seems important to a sense of western democratic identity to distance itself from China, particularly in situations that don't look very different. Secondly, because one's image of China is of a repressive country, we don't think of it as a place with an active sex industry. In fact illegal prostitution and semi-legal concubinage is everywhere; when there was a clampdown on prostitution in 2000, economists saw a 1% fall in GDP. The country is now seeing, after all, the first generation to reach adulthood since the one-child policy was introduced in 1979, and the gender disparity is marked: estimates give 32 million excess men. As long ago as 2004, government minister Li Weixiong directly cited the gender imbalance for the febrile sexual atmosphere, predicting worse to come in terms of prostitution and people trafficking, as well as social unrest, civil war, even, and insisting ""this is by no means sensational"". Researchers are wary, however, of blaming the sex industry on gender ratios. Dr Thérèse Hesketh, a senior lecturer in International Health at UCL, observes that: ""The areas where there are most sex workers are not the areas where there are the highest gender ratios. Largely, poverty is one of the ­greatest drivers of the sex industry."" Hesketh is also suspicious of Li's predictions of orgiastic apocalypse: based on research she's conducting at the moment, she has found that: ""These unmarried men are quite withdrawn, introvert, shy guys. They are not the kind of guys who are going to go out and start a riot."" Nevertheless, the government remains terrified of sex in terms of its potential as a spur for unrest. And here, thirdly, is the cognitive gap that makes it so hard to take the Green Dam Youth Escort programme at face value: the Chinese think they can prevent social unrest by controlling pornography. We think this must surely be a smokescreen for preventing explicit political content, since sexual content is itself a form of control. There is no better way on earth to castrate collectivised protest than to have everyone sitting in their bedroom, atomised and alienated, doing things they want to do in private. The Chinese government don't even need market research to see that, they only need to look at us. In the end, precisely because there appears to be this curious institutional naivety about the impact of gender imbalance as well as the impact of pornography, indeed, about the interplay between sex and politics altogether, I find it more and more plausible that they mean what they say. This really is an attempt to control sex on the web, and has nothing to do with dissidence. Just because it's plausible, of course, doesn't mean it's not ridiculous.

"I remember Tony Blair early in his premiership discussing cabinet government with Roy Jenkins. Or, rather, not discussing cabinet government. For, as Blair explained, he did not intend cabinet ever to last longer than an hour; the best cabinet was 30 minutes. He planned to drive government from Number 10, using all the powers at his discretion to get his way as fast and efficiently as possible. Jenkins gently reproached his young charge; it would lead to great political mischief, as it did. Think Iraq. But Blair understood both the key to, and temptation of, the unwritten British constitution. For although it is legitimised by regular parliamentary elections, Britain's organisation of government is essentially monarchical. With control of the House of the Commons, the prime minister is de facto an elected monarch, a seductive power that ultimately is each holder's undoing. Thatcher and Blair found that out. Brown is learning the same lesson. His problems, beyond the many of his own making, go back to the nature of our constitution. There are few formal checks and balances. The executive power of the crown, borrowed by the prime minister, saturates everything. The constitutional story is that the crown dissolves Parliament at will because it is her Parliament; in reality, the power becomes the prime minister's. Similarly, and for the same reasons, the prime minister can create and dismantle departments of state at will. He or she can appoint anybody to the House of Lords to become a minister with zero process. Patronage abounds. But from that unconstrained power comes all manner of psychoses and opportunities for political implosion. Worse, it creates a dysfunctional state in which efficient public spending is close to impossible. For a start, the plenipotentiary powers of the prime minister quickly turn Number 10 into a court. Both Mrs Thatcher and Mr Blair ran governments with the disproportionate influence of key courtiers attracted by the magnetism of such raw power. Alan Walters second-guessed chancellor Nigel Lawson's economic policy while Bernard Ingham had huge influence as press secretary; Jonathan Powell, Peter Mandelson and Alastair Campbell played similar roles for Blair. For Gordon Brown, it is Ed Balls, Peter Mandelson, Shriti Vedera and, until recently, Damian McBride. To an extent, courtiers surround government leaders in all democracies; it is worse here because of the sheer scale of the discretionary power in the prime minister's hands. Caroline Flint's complaint about an inside tier of the cabinet from which she was excluded could have been made by any minister in modern times. But this concentration of power also sets up incredible political tension. Because constitutionally the parliament is not the people's but the crown's, once a politician commands a parliamentary majority, he or she can become prime minister in midterm without having to call an election. So eliminate the incumbent and that power can be yours. It is this possibility that allowed Brown to menace and undermine Blair for 10 years. On top of all this, only the Treasury has similar discretionary power as Number 10. Brown, withholding details of public spending plans from his prime minister or even the results of the five tests on the euro until hours before they were publicly released, understood how the system conferred extraordinary personal power on him as well as his boss. He then mounted a ruthless putsch to give himself a three years as unelected prime minister. Nor, in other systems, could there ever have been Brown's subsequent hesitation over whether to call an election based only on party and personal advantage. Indeed, elections are culturally awkward. Brown and his supporters could argue without embarrassment that he should be crowned rather than compete with other candidates, because an election would be ""distracting"". Now, despite his evident lack of leadership qualities and the electoral defeat facing his party, he is made immeasurably safer because MPs fear his deposition would immediately trigger a general election which Labour is ill-prepared to fight. This is a mess not just because of personalities and factional fights. It is a mess because of the constitution, just as it was for the Tories before them. The deformation reaches into the heart of the state; it is one of the reasons why the public sector's record on productivity and innovation is so indifferent. A classic example is the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (DIUS). Brown created this department out of the old Department of Education & DTI especially for Ed Balls in 2007, a bauble for a favoured courtier. However, Balls insisted he deserved better and was rewarded with the new Department for Children, Schools and Families. Now, to compensate him for not becoming chancellor, which he thought was his right until James Purnell's resignation, and Peter Mandelson for not becoming foreign secretary, after 20 months DIUS is being broken up and the constituent parts given back to their old departments. Departments of state and, with them, great swaths of public spending, are treated as political spoils. With Geoff Hoon's resignation as transport secretary, this department alone will have had four secretaries of state in three years. It's a similar story in defence, with environment and energy only marginally less hard hit; these are all departments with long-term planning horizons, but whose political leaders are birds of passage. What chance is there of difficult decisions being taken? Systematic policy developed? Of careful attention invested in how effectively and efficiently cash is spent? Prime ministers and opposition leaders talk about eliminating waste in government. What they never grasp is that the inefficiency of so much public spending is integrally bound up with Britain's constitutional settlement. Brown, like Cameron, shores up his position through patronage and so prevents any significant politician from building an independent power base. The culture of the reshuffle grows out of the capacity continually to create new political spoils as political exigency dictates, a patronage that comes from borrowed monarchical discretion. We watched Brown at it again on Friday. But the impact on the underlying departments and efficiency with which public money is spent is bound to be disastrous. MPs' expenses are part and parcel of this sorry, discretionary, patronage story. Brown as chancellor and now as prime minister, complete with his ""black"" politics, is a creature of this system. The factionalism it generates creates bitterness that lasts for years. What is needed is a written constitution, itself a precursor of a reformed capitalism, effective public activism and lasting social change. This, as James Purnell said in his resignation letter, must be the progressive case. Labour had its chance to lead the reform. Brown was resister-in-chief. Now, like Faust, his time of reckoning approaches. The tragedy is that he takes the Labour party down with him.","Until we change the system, prime ministers will always act like king | Will Hutton",2009-06-06T23:01:00Z,Will Hutton,politics
"      In an ancient city, America's still-new president aimed to heal a rift that has endured for decades, if not centuries. Barack Obama stood before a crowd of 3,000 in the great hall of Cairo University to deliver a speech that demonstrated not only his trademark eloquence but also the sheer ambition of his purpose – nothing less than bridging the divide between Islam and the west. ""No single speech can eradicate years of mistrust,"" Obama began, mindful of the expectations that preceded today's event. Still, as he has proved, a major address can have a major impact – and there will be few more masterful speeches than this one. The president did not unveil a new policy programme or Middle East peace plan. Instead, it will be the tone – even the vocabulary – he used that will have the greatest impact. For the thread that ran through every paragraph was a simple but radical idea: respect for the Arab and Muslim world. It was there in Obama's use of the traditional Muslim greeting, met with cheering applause: assalamu alaykum. There, too, in his quotations from ""the holy Qur'an"" – pronouncing the word the way his Cairo audience would pronounce it. ""I know civilisation's debt to Islam,"" he declared, before listing a Muslim record of achievement that stretched from algebra to poetry. All of this was a world away from George W Bush, who was unable to address Muslims in a tone that was not bellicose or patronising. If Bush had said the same words, they would have sounded phoney. But Obama had the credibility of his own life story: the Muslims in his father's family, the childhood years in Indonesia. What had threatened to be a liability for Barack Hussein Obama in the 2008 election campaign was deployed as an asset. But it went deeper than flattery about the great Islamic past. He showed understanding, if not always acceptance, of what one might call the Arab and Muslim narrative. So he spoke of past ""colonialism"", a word shocking to hear from a US president. He admitted the cold-war use of Muslim nations as ""proxies"", and confessed to US involvement in the toppling of Iran's elected prime minister in 1953. One analyst noted references to ""dignity"" and ""justice"" and against ""humiliation"", words that resonate in Muslim discourse. Obama's aim was to break through the suspicion and cynicism that have accreted over decades and show that America is under truly new management. So he did not defend the invasion of Iraq, but called it a ""war of choice"". Nowhere was the effort to acknowledge the Arab and Muslim narrative more dramatic than in the long passage on Israel-Palestine. There had, reportedly, been a debate among Obama aides over whether he should use the charged word ""occupation"" to describe Israel's hold of the territories it gained in 1967. Obama used it – and spoke of ""Palestine"", not a ""future Palestinian state."" More striking, he did not confine his recognition of Palestinian suffering to the situation since 1967. ""For more than 60 years, they have endured the pain of dislocation,"" he said, surely coming closer than any previous US president to acknowledging what Palestinians call the nakba – catastrophe – of 1948. And he repeated his demand for Israeli ­settlement activity to stop. But make no mistake: this was no exercise in pandering to the Muslim world. He passionately defended Jews' right to a homeland, before condemning Muslim antisemitism and Holocaust denial as ""baseless … ignorant …hateful"". He recognised that Hamas has genuine support among Palestinians, but excoriated the group's methods: ""It is a sign neither of courage nor power to shoot rockets at sleeping children, or to blow up old women on a bus,"" he said. ""That's not how moral authority is claimed; that's how it is surrendered."" He invoked the struggles for civil rights in the US, against apartheid and slavery, urging Hamas to follow the path of non-violent resistance. From any of his predecessors, that would have rung hollow. From the first African-American president, it carried great weight. Obama navigated perilous terrain. He urged the Muslim and Arab world to embrace democracy, women's rights and economic development – difficult to do from the capital of a sclerotic regime. And when he called on the Muslim world to respect women's rights, he stressed his respect for the hijab and his opposition to westerners ""dictating what clothes a Muslim woman should wear"". Whether this sensitive, supple and sophisticated speech will be remembered will depend on whether the rhetoric of respect is matched by a change in action. And that, as Obama admitted, is more than the work of one day.",Barack Obama in Cairo: the speech no other president could make | Jonathan Freedland,2009-06-04T19:47:57Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"Something about its ­title suggests to me that ­Britain's Got Talent is meant to be feelgood entertainment: nobody seems to have come out of it feeling very good. Susan Boyle is, it has been well-documented, being treated for exhaustion. There is an outpouring of media mea culpa (meeja culpa?), with Euan Ferguson taking responsibility for the Observer (""Yes, we in the media are guilty: guiltier than anyone, of course""), Amanda Platell taking one for the Daily Mail (""Why did we, as addicted viewers – and I include myself in that category – collude in Susan's downfall?""), Nicci Gerrard, holding her hands up for the Telegraph (""The story of Susan Boyle … now reads like a lesson in sadness and shame. Her sadness and our shame."") I'm not totally persuaded of the ­sincerity of all this: more likely, it's just a rhetorical conceit, an entry point for accusing everyone else. Victims are a natural byproduct of these programmes – they're Simon Cowell's carbon footprint, ye shall know him by the trail of losers. Nobody likes to think they added to this pain just by sitting by and laughing, so everyone ends up feeling bad about it. But the guilt is complicated by the fact that, however bad you feel for the losers, you're not the real winner. The TV companies, clearly, are the only ones winning big from this display. In consequence, the relationship between viewer and broadcaster gets sourer and more combustible every year, erupting periodically in storms that are either foolish (the Big Brother 8 racism) or incredibly unlucky (the death of Jade Goody) or badly thought-out (the treatment of Susan Boyle), but in no sense reflect the real problem. The real problem is that the business model for these programmes is all screwed up. Reality TV is like a pyramid scheme: fiscally, it works out incredibly well for the people who invented it (Endemol) and/or got in early (SyCo), but it has diminishing returns. The competitors might not require money, but they do require attention. None of us would feel guilty about a well-adjusted attention seeker, seeking and getting attention, but the well-adjusted are not that interesting. Contestants have to be unhinged in some way: this makes it more ­dramatic but undermines the human sympathy between the viewer and the contestants. Annette Hill, professor of media at Westminster University, remarks on a striking change, between the publication of her first book on the subject – Reality TV, published in 2005, and her second, Restyling Factual TV, in 2007: ""In the first study of 10,000 people, audiences played the game of reality TV, understanding it was staged and enjoying the hybrid elements of fiction and fact. By the time of Restyling Factual TV, the second study of around 5,000 people in Britain and Sweden showed people were more concerned about the way this genre had become out of control, a feral genre, wildly opportunistic, resistant to re-containment … People had the same concerns about reality TV in both countries, suggesting a clear trend in public awareness of the genre on factual programming overall."" As much as this concern plays out in hostility towards the contestants themselves – and even Boyle has been spoken of with incredible cruelty – disapproval is mainly, and rightly, directed against the TV production companies, especially where the contestants have mental health issues. Hill cites the following research: ""For example, only 26% of people in a representative sample of 4,500, claimed that people with mental health problems were treated fairly in reality TV. Over half the sample (57%) said they thought it was important that such people were treated fairly."" It's turning into a nice distinction, ""normal"" people versus people with ""mental health problems"", in a genre that deliberately screens for extreme eccentricity, and whose results can be so fervid that you'd have to be mad to consider going on in the first place. There are calls now for better ""regulation"". But they don't need more onsite psychologists, or better pastoral care or better vetting or anything like that. They can make it look fairer by being fairer. If Boyle were walking away with a million quid in her pocket, nobody would even mention that she was exhausted. Diversity claim to feel good about their win, but they're walking away with a £100k prize when there are 10 of them. That's £10k apiece. Kelly Brook got her full fee of £100k and was sacked after six days. The problem is not that this is cheap telly, it's that its prizes are doled out disproportionately. The marshals, who keep it respectable with their big names – Simon Cowell, Ant and Dec – make ever larger sums; the voting brings in dizzying amounts; and the ""ordinary"" people make modest sums if they're lucky, and if they're not, just about cover their travel expenses. Grand promises of lifelong fame and fortune simply don't play out, especially not for saxophonists. The reason the producers behind all this seem so concerned, so penitent, so careful of the mental health of their ""charges"" is that being in fake loco parentis is so much cheaper than the real solution, which is money.

"What was once good for General Motors was good for America. No more. Tomorrow, America's biggest car manufacturer is expected to sue for bankruptcy. The idea is that it will be managed by the US government over no more than two or three months to emerge on the other side as a smaller, leaner, ""good"" GM - with its creditors accepting massive losses, shareholders eliminated and many workers laid off. It is a tough but necessary restructuring.  The news has been followed closely by more than 5,000 British car workers at GM's Vauxhall's factories at Ellesmere Port and Luton. Unless a buyer could be found for GM's European operations, the companies faced administration and dismemberment as part of the bankruptcy process. Yesterday, a rescuer emerged - Canadian autoparts maker Magna. It has committed to continue production in Britain, although what that means in detail and beyond the election is extremely murky. The history of transnational car company takeovers is not auspicious. The trouble is that the world has too many car factories. Globally, production capacity is 90 million, yet car demand has fallen below 60 million. Worse, most of the capacity is for cars that should have been discontinued years ago because of their energy and carbon inefficiency. The car companies with the deepest pockets and best models will get through. Weaker brethren like General Motors will not. Car workers are among the last of the factory-based working class. Average hourly wages are around £10 and shift premium can add up to a third more. There is little job autonomy and the work often monotonous. Insecurity is a fact of life. If the factory closes, as a Work Foundation study of the MG-Rover closure at Longbridge highlighted (I am the vice-chairman of the Work Foundation), workers find it hard to get other jobs as well paid. Two-thirds ended up earning on average £100 a week less and 10% were still unemployed three years later - and that was before the recession. Tony Woodley, joint general secretary of Unite, is exerting maximum pressure to keep British plants open. Lord Mandelson, secretary of state for business, insisted that he was fully engaged with the negotiations, ready to stump up cash if necessary, but not unconditionally. Woodley's complaint is that while the Germans have negotiated hard to keep Opel's four German plants open, the British are barely acquainted with the details of Magna's business plan. In effect, we have tried to ride off the German commitment to keep GM Europe going, not negotiating with serious intent or with serious money. The results are painfully clear. When the process began, two German plants were set to close and one to be sold; now Magna is promising 2,500 job losses in Germany, in effect the loss of just one shift. The factory in Belgium is likely to close, the giant plant at Zaragoza in Spain will stay open, and the rest of the burden will be shouldered by Britain.  Lord Mandelson will probably stave off significant job losses until after the election. But Renault wants out of the joint venture in the Luton van plant and no new models are planned - a death warrant; without intervention, it will shut by 2012. Ellesmere Port has longer; it manufactures the new Astra but by 2015, if unsupported, it will have gone too.  Woodley insists that the government must know this. The German government has offered a €1.5bn bridging loan and has won guarantees on four plants. It believes in making things. Lord Mandelson has not committed a penny. In fairness, Luton would be tough to save, but Ellesmere Plant is a factory with a good productivity record. Its future could and should be assured. The trouble is that British governments don't think in industrial terms - they think in financial terms, around benchmarks set by the anti-industrial, short-termist City whose priorities have been left unreformed despite the financial catastrophe. Why, ask officials, should the government offer a bridging loan that the market will not? They never ask why the term structure of British lending is so short term compared with other countries; why loan margins are so high; and why the interaction of British bankruptcy law and ownership system brings factory closures and foreign ownership.  Twelve years into a Labour government, one might have hoped for better. Imagine the creation of an industrial culture in which somebody fought for, say, the Vauxhall, Jaguar or Land Rover brands under British ownership. This is not a protectionist, but a pluralist position: neither a wholly British-owned nor wholly foreign-owned industrial sector is desirable. You want a mix, because as we will discover again when Magna owns Opel and redirects Luton's van production to Russia and Ellesmere's car production to Spain and Germany, ownership matters. To get ""good"" British long-term owners of industrial assets requires creating structures of corporate law, shareholder responsibilities and long-term bank lending that the City has always opposed. Such structures threaten margins in the financial services industry and the City's international position, which is still considered more important than the UK industrial base and, by inference, the wages and living standards of UK workers. City lobbyists have had no more enthusiastic ally than Gordon Brown. The issue is not only that Lord Mandelson has no options, unlike the Germans. There is no wider banking, ownership and investment framework with which to ground a long-term solution, or American-style bankruptcy procedures through which productive assets can be rescued at the expense of shareholders, creditors and bond holders. We need to build an economy founded on knowledge industries and services as the pace of innovation accelerates. The task is made immeasurably harder with current institutions and structures, as Lord Mandelson now recognises and, to his credit, if too late, is trying to address. Ahead lies yet more economic restructuring and job changes numbering millions. To assist that, we need a more secure system of employment - the ""flexicurity"" pioneered in Scandinavia; generous unemployment benefit alongside extensive retraining. We don't have that. Redundancy in these circumstances is less of a personal catastrophe.  All these reforms were obviously necessary before Labour took office; I set them out in The State We're In alongside a programme of political and constitutional change. But that chance was squandered; the City could not be challenged and control of the state conferred by British constitutional rules was too intoxicating. The Labour government has done some good - the minimum wage, the NHS constitution, next year's job guarantee for 18- to 24-year-olds. But my generation's opportunity seriously to reform the way Britain does capitalism and democracy - and with it the living standards of millions - has been squandered. All that now awaits is political annihilation.",The lessons we should learn from the wreckage of the British car industry | Will Hutton,2009-05-30T23:01:00Z,Will Hutton,politics
"On the eternal sands of the Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, the locals still celebrate the Scottish influence on Brazilian football. As the 20th century dawned, a group of Scottish professionals playing in the fledgling Brazilian national football league taught the locals about the beauty and the economy of passing the ball quickly to one another. Soon, those teams who had adopted ""the Scottish art"" were meeting with untold success as the fleet-footed Caledonian conquistadors in their squad cut through opposition defences like dentures through a smoked sausage supper. It was even whispered that Pelé, wearing his Lion Rampant like a cape, weekly offered up a private benediction to the Scottish nation for influencing the footballing alchemy with which he bewitched the world in the 1960s and 1970s. Now, 30 years after the Oraanje revolution when a Dutch dilettante called Johan Cruyff demonstrated a new philosophy called ""Total Football"", Scotland has bequeathed a fresh concept to the Beautiful Game. It is called simply ""slow-motion football"". Indeed, some Scottish football clubs in Europe have recently modified it even further by actually running backwards with the ball. Sadly, continental football coaches have resisted the temptation to slow the game down in the modern Scottish tradition. Instead, they persist with deploying very skilful players who can pass the ball quickly ... and to players in their own team. The consequences of this have been stark for Scotland who have now failed to qualify for an international tournament for 11 years. The Stone of Destiny will be back at Scone Palace before Scotland ever competes at the business end of a major tournament again. Yet, when London won the contract to host the 2012 Olympic Games, there appeared a glimmer of hope that, for some lucky Scottish footballers, the international stage may indeed soon become a reality. For the British Olympic Committee stated that a football team representing GB would take part in the football tournament for the first time since 1972. Darren Fletcher, Manchester United's estimable midfielder and Sunderland's athletic young goalkeeper, Craig Gordon, would have been candidates for the team. Last Friday though, their hopes were dashed. For it was finally announced that football team GB would be represented solely by English players after the home associations of Scotland, Ireland and Wales, principally influenced by the Scots, barred any of their players from taking part. George Peat and Gordon Smith, the Laurel and Hardy act who run Scottish football, were fearful that to have taken part in the UK team would be to compromise the future existence of a sovereign Scottish football team. It is an utterly fatuous claim and without any foundation in reality. Football's governing body, Fifa, had given private guarantees that there would be no question of Scotland's football independence being lost. So effectively, Peat and Smith have said to their international masters: ""We don't believe you."" Very possibly this may not make it into Henry Kissinger's compendium of diplomatic masterstrokes. Nor does Alex Salmond, Scotland's first minister, emerge from this mean-spirited little episode in our inglorious football history with much credit. From the touchline, he encouraged the easily led Smith to adopt this ridiculous position. Salmond's position on this issue makes no political sense. Not long after it had been announced that London had secured the games, Salmond was whining about this being an event for the whole of the United Kingdom and that Scottish construction firms should be allowed to fill their boots with a healthy share of building contracts. His part in Scotland's twisted refusal to allow our players to join Team GB will surely have resonated with those principal contractors who otherwise may have been disposed to helping our struggling construction industry with some juicy wee projects. And surely Salmond must realise that, if ever there were a serious threat to the future existence of a Scottish international football team, there would follow a 90% Yes vote in any independence referendum? One of the primary jobs of the Scottish Football Association and its chief executive, Gordon Smith, is to foster the playing of the game at every level. He also has a duty to encourage the highest ideals of sportsmanship and universal participation, the same ideals that the Olympic movement encourages throughout the planet. Preventing players such as Darren Fletcher and Craig Gordon from participating in a once-in-a-lifetime event is shameful. It's thought that at least one Scottish footballer is so incensed at losing the chance to represent his country in 2012 that he has considered making a legal challenge. In this, he should be encouraged. And he may gain succour from the experience of Lionel Messi, Barcelona FC's Argentinian forward who is currently the world's best player. So desperate was Messi to represent his country at the last Olympics that he risked the wrath of his employers to do so. Barcelona were not keen on their prize asset playing at Beijing in 2008 and appealed to football's governing authorities to prevent it. In this, they were given short shrift and Messi duly represented his country with distinction. If any Scottish player made a similar appeal to Fifa , they may find it difficult to turn down.

"Come Dawkinsites and Hitchenistas, militant atheists and unrelenting secularists: not that I am a believer, you understand, but if you want a sobering lesson in the fact that religion can be a thoroughly progressive force and a source of hope in otherwise desperate circumstances – to quote Karl Marx out of context, ""the heart in a heartless world"" – well, you really should spend an hour and a bit in the company of the former archbishop of Cape Town. Desmond Tutu spoke at the Hay festival last night. His appearance was billed as a lecture, though as it turned out, he was interviewed by the festival director Peter Florence, before taking a handful of questions from the floor. For anyone of a halfway irreverent disposition (and in this, I think I'd include Tutu himself), these things can be rather strange affairs, so brimming with lovey-dovey admiration that they end up turning ever-so-slightly surreal, and so it proved: when he merely said ""Good evening"", they clapped. There again, if anyone deserves the full liberal love-bomb treatment, he does. Point one, then: the progressive uses of religion. Tutu is something of an advert for the humble, flexible, self-questioning ways of many Anglicans, as proved by this quote in particular: ""'Islam is a violent faith' – Christians are not the best people to say that. We burnt witches. We burnt people we said were heretics. Just think of all the wars… and more recently, the people who perpetrated apartheid were not heathens – they said they had the support of the Bible. The crusades? Ha! We have to be a lot more modest."" Either side of that point were parts of the conversation to which I would love to hear Dawkins, Hitchens et al respond. If a country is emerging from great convulsive change, and a drive for retribution hangs in the air, it is surely a good thing to have Tutu's kind of Christianity around, replete with its cool insistence on even-handedness, peace, and the necessity of always holding fast to an idea of common humanity. After that, he talked about the way that, during the apartheid years' lowest points, faith had not only hardened his resolve, but often defined the emancipatory ideas clung to by truly desperate people. I am still enough of an atheist to find quoting this stuff a little discomfiting; if you want to argue with it, feel free, but I'm not sure how you can. ""It was as if the scriptures had been written directly for us,"" he said. ""If you want to oppress people, the last thing you should give them is the Bible. Don't!"" And here, just to make things really go off, is point two: apartheid, Israel-Palestine, and the parallels therein. Tutu talked at length about Zimbabwe (the details are here), but it was when he spoke about a recent visit to Gaza – under the auspices of the United Nations human rights commission – that the evening reached its most heart-stopping moment. Going through Israeli checkpoints, he said, ""brought back memories of what things had been like back home"": arbitrariness and arrogance as a demonstration of power, and an ongoing challenge to anyone would threaten it. He then told the story of a woman scooping the remains of her baby off a floor and watching another son die (it was more grisly than that, but mere text wouldn't do it justice), and then said though many aspects of life in Gaza reminded him of South Africa, these horrors represented something else again. Tutu said he still supported a two-state solution, which, as far as I could see, was his only real weakness. Comparisons, of course, are odious – but there again, within the vague plans for peace peddled by far too many people, there may well be echoes of some of the apartheid state's most mendacious aspects: the Palestinian state as an archipelago of Middle Eastern Bantustans, and that region's iniquitous power balance barely altered. ""One of the reasons God put South Africa as an example of success,"" he said, ""was to give the world some tangible notice that there's no situation that is totally intractable, so the world would have to say: 'If they can do it in South Africa then they can do it anywhere.'"" It's a nice thought, but if it's to have any force, it needs the proviso that too many people ignore: that if the Almighty could hand down a universal peace plan, at its heart would be one insistence above all others: that, to use a very earthly pun, one state fits all.","Hay festival: Tutu, an archbishop for unbelievers | John Harris",2009-05-29T12:00:00Z,John Harris,world
"Is Wales finally claiming Hay for its own? The town is half in Wales, but in years of coming to the festival I have sometimes wondered. Bilingual signs are the nearest to a sense of foreign parts, and the occasional inclusion of Welsh writers and exhibitors has seemed token. Not this year. The Welsh National Library chose Hay for the launch of its online compendium of Welsh journalism at the festival, a project way ahead of England's equivalent. The Oxfam young writers' competition was won by a novel first written in Welsh and the completion of the Pevsner guides to Welsh buildings with the volume on Gwynedd was celebrated by its co-author, Julian Orbach, at a packed meeting. More than that, for once I detected that questions from the floor, on Gwynedd and in the session on my book on Welsh castles, houses and churches, had Welsh accents predominating. References to the beauty of Wales, to its growing political cohesion and to a need for it to show greater confidence in selling itself were all greeting with rounds of applause. These were Welsh audiences for sure. I have a growing sense of a place whose identity is in transition. Wales's emergence nine years ago, however tentative, with its own regional government can now be seen as seminal. Not for 600 years since Glendower had Wales enjoyed anything remotely like self-rule. The number of voters prepared to tolerate the much-abused Welsh assembly rises by the year. As in Scotland, the establishment of something like self-government has been enough to draw attention and controversy to the capital and to its political apparatus. Unlike in Scotland, this had to emerge afresh. While the participants have been of variable quality, it was noticeable how many questioners referred to them, warts and all. The abolition of devolution is already unthinkable. Whether the literary culture of Wales, represented in Welsh at the national Eisteddfod, can co-operate with what is in truth Wales's premier literary festival – but in English – remains to be seen. Hay prides itself on its national and international status, but that status is essentially English. Just as I believe the Eisteddfod should be more open to Welsh writers in English, so Hay should welcome the gorsedd and its extraordinary literary richness into its marquees.

"There is something to be said for having a celebrity parachute herself into your constituency. No protracted fussing on the doorstep. Only: ""Hello, I'm from me."" The policy conversation is also brief. As it's impossible to know what line the celebrity might take in a parliamentary vote except, perhaps, where higher rate taxation is concerned, these candidates ask only that you believe in their niceness. In the case of Martin Bell, it helped that he wore a white suit and was brave. Esther Rantzen, in what must be an inviting prospect for Luton South, prefers the symbolic effect of her legs, in fishnet tights. ""I weigh about the same as I did at 30,"" she said, flashing them last year in the Daily Mail. ""I pride myself that I have the spring, bounce and youthful energy of a lamb."" So can she depend on your vote? This may depend on whether you remember Esther sharing a recent compliment from her gynaecologist, following a routine examination. ""It's all in excellent working order; don't waste it."" Last week, the celebrity asked readers to disregard what might look like the comparative atrophy of her political responses, progressing over four or five decades. ""I have always been fascinated by politics,"" she insisted, ""but never found any one party manifesto that I could swallow whole."" Where individual politicians are concerned, however, there is some evidence that she has leant towards the Conservative. Older readers may remember the late Sir Nicholas Fairbairn, the tartan-suited dipsomaniac and Tory MP for Kinross and Western Perthshire. He makes a surprise appearance in an early section of Esther, the autobiography, a book which must serve, for the time being, as Rantzen's manifesto. ""How did he seduce me?"" Rantzen asks, in a passage which one of her admirers, Craig Brown, has already rendered into the libretto form, in the event of its inspiring a modern opera. ""He took me to lunch at the Ritz. He gave me a long-stemmed red rose and ordered Beluga caviare and Krug champagne. I had never eaten Beluga caviare by the potful before. The Beluga consisted of huge, succulent globes that exploded on the tongue. If ever there was an aphrodisiac meal, this was it. Nicholas took me to some lord's house where he was staying and the rest was inevitable."" As persuasive as this might be to a certain kind of floating voter, it resists comparison with standard party literature relating to schools and hospitals. Perhaps it would be fairer, in future, if celebrities could stand against one another: Barbara Windsor against Gloria Hunniford, for example, Anne Robinson v Judy Finnigan. Until then, as Esther Rantzen has pointed out, there is a danger she might be discriminated against, come election time, just for being famous. ""The first decision was to assess whether voters there would welcome my intervention,"" she writes of Luton South. ""Would they share the view of a few professional politicians who have begun to sneer about a 'celebrity', a mere 'TV personality', muscling in on their act."" To visit Luton incognito was clearly out of the question. ""Communication,"" she says, ""is an important part of a politician's role."" It is a measure of her skill, in this department, that so many of us are familiar with Esther's work as the face of Accident Advice Helpline. ""Have you been injured in an accident that wasn't your fault?"" This is something that the voters of Luton South might want to think about. Can no one help them with Esther, on a no-win, no-fee basis? You might reflect, as a Luton South voter, that it is enough for your MP (Margaret Moran) to go awol following her Southampton disgrace. Must your constituency be further punished, as the arena in which Britain's rebellious tradition finds its ultimate expression: a demand for government by celebrity? But, given the existing number of celebrity satellites, with Carol Vorderman (popular voice of debt consolidation), appointed Cameron's maths mistress, and Mariella Frostrup adding lustre to appearances by Gordon Brown, the scandal has only accelerated an inevitable movement towards the centre of things. And if Joanna Lumley is too intelligent to lead them into the coming election, Rantzen is by no means the worst alternative. Alan Sugar, Richard Branson, and Simon Cowell are among the attention-seeking plutocrats already mentioned as preferable to your resident parliamentary shyster. To the point that, for the first time since the whole unravelling began, one begins to feel a sneaking sympathy for the average parliamentary kleptomaniac. He is unlikely, after all, to have diverted the profits of his soft-furnishing scam into an account in the Virgin Islands. In fact, most pretenders to an independent parliamentary career, famous or not, will need to have enriched themselves somehow for that purpose, in ways which may never be examined by the Daily Telegraph Even if one were satisfied, where individuals such as Mr Branson are concerned, with the self-declaration of philanthropy, there would remain some doubt over their potential to change things, once they had also changed habitat. Joanna Lumley, for example, triumphed over Phil Woolas because she, unlike him, is famous, and uncontaminated by politics. As Joanna Lumley, MP, she would face a horrifying reverse: Mr Woolas, useless thesp that he is, would be allowed to patronise her. How, then, would she continue to do good? Ms Rantzen is not alone in believing that a contingent of random, unpredictable show-offs would be an ornament to the house. ""Voters can trust independent MPs not to be motivated by a lust for power,"" she explains, ""as they'll never achieve office."" Yet the set-up does not sound dissimilar from I'm a Celebrity... Get me Out of Here. Can we trust celebrity independents not to regard political showtime as a natural next step for any reality-TV specialist for whom Strictly Come Dancing is but a distant memory? If the number of plausible MPs is now alarmingly diminished, the pool of acceptable celebrity choices is, surely, smaller still. So much so that one cannot even propose a straightforward life-swap whereby, for example, the Ivy acquires Alan Duncan and Hazel Blears, in exchange for Graham Norton and Kate Winslet. Who would you give for Jonathan Ross? Anthony Steen and Stephen Fry cancel one another out. The one kind of MP who cannot be parachuted into a constituency is, by definition, the one you might actually want: the local candidate. It would help if they were also honest, idealistic, practical and diligent. But perhaps the academics who study human venality are right. Such people never existed. Everyone is on the take. Everything the government says about the voluntary sector is bilge. You are less likely to find an ordinary, incorruptible individual prepared to serve her community than to see a person in fishnets plummeting from the sky. If she asks if you have recently been injured in an accident that wasn't your fault you will know it is Esther Rantzen. Representing herself.",Government by celebrity?

"So pretty much everyone is delighted that all the Gurkhas can stay in Britain, not just the ones who retired after 1997. While cogent arguments were made that the Gurkhas originally agreed to their terms, and had already been treated fairly well, this was drowned out by the roar of adulation for Joanna Lumley, our actress heroine in pashminas, whose father had fought with the Gurkhas and who, at the point of victory, shouted: ""Ayo Gurkhali"" (""The Gurkhas are coming""), with tears in her lovely eyes. By the end, the people were calling for a damehood for Lumley, Gordon Brown praised her ""campaigning skills"", big guns from all the political parties jostled to claim her victory as their own, to the point where you couldn't help but wonder: what is it with Joanna - is she the minister whisperer? More to the point, what does Lumley fever say about Britain?  Is a beautiful, popular, charming actress the only hope of getting this morally inert nation going? Let's be clear, I have nothing against Lumley, who was simply being a good daughter, fighting for the comrades of her father, nor do I have a problem with the Gurkhas settling in Britain. What does concern me is the Lumley effect and how ridiculous it has made Britain look.  Yes, you read right - ridiculous. Not decent, honourable, noble or any of the other qualities certain Britons liked to feel they were displaying regarding their solidarity with the Gurkhas; instead, how about silly, suggestible, not to mention disingenuous? Before Lumley came along, I'd have been surprised if more than 20% of the country even knew who the Gurkhas were. Even if they did, they'd probably never have been more than vaguely ""pro"". So why the hysteria and is there any hope of it translating to other deserving causes? Some have pinpointed the plight of the abandoned Iraqi translators; who will ""Lumley"" for them? Or does it just stop here, the giant gushing tap of Great British international fair play, turned off, left to rust again, because Lovely Lumley isn't around. There were even times during her campaign when she became rather unlovely, verging on po-faced and self-righteous, reminding one of Tony Blair at his messianic worst. However, in fairness, she had no choice. She knew it had to be a drama and one about her. This most intelligent of actresses knew she had to keep that story going or everyone would lose interest. However, did our ministers, including the prime minister, have to be quite so pathetic? It stumps me that it is being portrayed as wonderful that Lumley's charisma won the day. Had the old boy's network brought this about (""Come on, old bean!""), there would have been outrage, but somehow a beautiful female's charm offensive is fine. Personally, I'd rather presume that Gordon Brown made a cynical decision based on public mood than think of him blushing, grovelling and changing policy because a nice, smart woman asked him to. It is actually disturbing to think that if Purdy hadn't smiled at the prime minister, the Gurkhas would not have been helped. As for the Tories, who did naff all for the Gurkhas when they were in power, shame on them for now grabbing for the limelight like two-minute wonders in a talent contest. And there lies the point. In America, there seemed much less fuss when Mia Farrow went on a hunger strike for Darfur, probably because Farrow is not as popular in the US as Lumley is here. Ultimately, what happened here was not so much a campaign as a popularity contest (Britain's Got Ethics?) and the ""best gal"" won. I, for one, do not begrudge Lumley or the Gurkhas, just so long as we remember that what this says about Britain as a nation may not be what we'd like it to be. Your crocodile tears are wasted on me, Mother P How disturbing was the letter the mother of Baby P wrote to the judge on the eve of sentencing, seemingly begging for mercy? For herself, that is. Formal, stiff, coy and self-pitying, it was all about her ""regret"" for the ""mistakes"" she'd made, how she had ""failed"" her son, ""let down"" her children. From this, anyone would have supposed her worst crime to be sending her son to nursery without a warm jumper, not at the very least allowing two brutes to snap his back and ribs in a series of assaults culminating in more than 50 separate injuries. All the while, she was fending off social services and smearing her son's tiny face with chocolate to conceal the bruises. In the end, Judge Stephen Kramer jailed her indefinitely, which in this case means at least five years. Her Nazi-obsessed boyfriend received 12 years for Baby P, life for raping a two-year-old girl (he must serve at least 10) and the lodger was jailed ""indefinitely"" (three years). Not enough, you might cry, but at least the judge saw through the mother, branding her, among other things, ""manipulative"". Which seems true enough, though she's not awfully good at it. Who else gets the feeling that Mother P is limbering up for the Myra Hindley defence of ""I was frightened of him. He made me do it""? It's the belief that suddenly comes over certain women locked in cells that, all along, they'd been terrified, dominated, intimidated and, come to think of it, Mr Appeal Lawyer, were almost definitely victims too. I am in no way decrying those victims of domestic violence too paralysed with fear and devoid of self-esteem to extricate themselves. However, even for these poor souls, it tends to be a tipping point when a man inflicts cruelty on a child. Which is why, while most women would feel nothing but sympathy for someone under the control of a violent man, as with Hindley and Brady, the compassion does not extend to women who hide behind psychopaths, refusing to accept responsibility for their own actions. The mother of Baby P had countless opportunities to save her child, but she chose not to. Now she should have the decency to restrict her crocodile tears to the confines of her cell. And you thought it was the proles who ate all the pies Could doctors, lawyers and others of the professional persuasion put down their kebabs and pay attention? This obesity alert relates to you. A survey by Quorn has revealed that it is the middle classes who are the biggest buyers of take-aways, more so than plumbers, taxi drivers or others of the so-called lower orders. And there we were, fondly imagining the professional classes go to bed, practically cuddling flasks of authentic balsamic vinegar, while all the time they were scarfing samosas, storing up God knows what health trouble for the future. Does Boden do gastric bands, do you think? But wait! The reason given for the middle-class takeaway binge is the financial climate, the stress and fatigue of dealing with ongoing global upheaval causing their terrible diets. Fancy. From credit crunch to credit munch in one easy step. Or do I smell a rat and this time not one scurrying among the cold cuts in one of Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares Correct me if I'm wrong, but when the working classes stuff down greasy, calorific, life-shortening take-aways, the fault is all theirs. How many times have I heard it said that they are feckless morons, who need to take personal responsibility for their lardy lifestyles and don't deserve any help from the NHS? By contrast, when the middle classes are caught vacuuming up nightly tubs of sweet'n'sour, it's magically not their fault; they are merely hapless victims of global financial forces. Poor things. Talk about convenience food. Isn't the credit munch just the most convenient excuse ever? The Bonnie and Clyde of our times I am secretly cheering on that New Zealand couple who did a runner after their bank mistakenly gave them £4m when they asked for a £4k loan. An appalling opportunistic crime? Of course, but who wouldn't if they had the guts? They are a Bonnie and Clyde for our times, particularly considering the bank's slogan: ""Make the most of life.""

"There were three things I had vowed never to do, but on a Scottish hillside last month, under a glowering sky, I succumbed to each of them in one fell day. I would never wear a rucksack. I would never compound that felony by taking a picture of other people wearing rucksacks. And I would never, ever bore the tits off my friends by subsequently telling them about Highland lochs, purple heather and rolling glens. I have been a bit of a disappointment to my mother country over the years. I love being Scottish, but there are many Scottish things I don't really like. ""The best wee country in the world,"" was the slogan dreamt up by our last first minister to greet visitors in the arrivals lounge at Glasgow Airport. It was a dreadful description of this country and summed up the couthy, chippy, small town, wha's like us? attitude of Scotland at its very worst. And don't even begin to talk to me about kilts. They're not even very Scottish or very traditional and they make the wearer look like he is appearing in his own grim Caledonian pantomime. Most Scottish men insist on wearing them at weddings and subsequently insist on failing to wear underwear with them. And when, late in the proceedings, and they are howling with the bevvy they always think that what all the women in the immediate vicinity really want at that tired hour is to discover that he is minus his foundation garments. I also love England and English people and it is perhaps this that has proved to be the source of my mother country's gravest disappointment in me. There is little not to love about England, the most civilised, reasonable and influential country on the planet, but unfortunately many of my countrymen, including several who really ought to know better, believe that hating the bastard English has to be a badge of their Scottish chauvinism. Often, they will try to disguise it as harmless wit, but it is about as funny as a Glasgow kiss at closing time. It is unworthy of my country and I wish she would grow out of it. And, until one fateful April day this year, I would have no truck with Munro-ism, the bewildering syndrome that enslaves many of my otherwise commendable countrymen and turns them into the most crashing of pub and dinner bores. There are nearly 300 Munros in Scotland, hills of more than 3,000 feet and awarded this banal appellation by someone called... Munro.  Lots of people collect Munros by ascending them, getting someone to take their picture at a blameless, hilltop cairn and then ensuring that it is their duty to tell urban and nocturnal dwellers such as myself about the Highland lochs, purple heather and rolling glens. They buy all their gear in outdoor shops belonging to a cartel of specialist retailers who charge them obscene amounts of money to make them look like Nanook of the bleedin' North. You also discover that there is an insidious pecking order in the practice of Munroism and their other hill-walking pursuits. You will find, for instance, that the experienced and knowledgeable Munroist will eschew Lowland areas such as Ben Lomond or the West Highland Way. For it is on places such as these that he may encounter the loathed Glaswegian day-tripper and his family who must be avoided at all costs. It is not difficult to discern a reason for their hauteur. For while the grim-faced, professional Munroist is done up to look like Scott of the Antarctic for the rigours ahead, the Glaswegian walker will sally forth on to these great wildernesses clad in little more than a cagoule, a Burberry baseball cap and a pair of Doctor Martens' finest on his feet. There may even be a couple of bottles of tonic wine to fortify him for the rigours of his bucolic peregrinations ahead. And, worst of all, from his relentlessly sunny features, he will issue a cheery: ""How goes it?"" or: ""Crackin' day for it."" A few weeks ago though, I was finally persuaded to let go of my prejudices and venture up one of these Munros by my wife and some friends. It was a cheeky wee mountain called Ben something or other and located somewhere between the Trossachs and the Cairngorms. And somewhere near the top, and after four hours of tramping, something very good happened. I gradually began to cease my cynical and increasingly unfunny asides with which I had assailed Stewart, my agreeably normal guide for the day. For a gap in the clouds had revealed a little hilltop loch, serene and shimmering under its own little sunburst and I believed I had glimpsed something almost perfect. A few steps later, I reached the summit and there my country finally revealed itself to me for the first time and it was beautiful and heartbreaking at the same time. And the heather was indeed purple and the glens truly did roll away and as I unscrewed my bottle of Buckfast, I knew that I would have to come back to that place once more.",Once I was a fervent anti-rucksack man | Kevin McKenna,2009-05-23T23:01:00Z,Kevin McKenna,uk
"Democracy is a process and an attitude of mind. It understands that the to-and-fro of argument is the best way communities feel their way to good decisions and good law. It holds executive power to account day by day for its actions, and periodically through elections. It protects liberty. British democracy falls short of these aspirations in many ways. For example, it is a two-chamber system that may genuflect to the role of deliberation and argument, but the House of Commons is ruthlessly controlled by the executive while the House of Lords is a useful revising chamber, but essentially a democratic cipher. That must change. The British will always site the government of the day in the House of Commons. As a result, its capacity to revise, deliberate and argue will always be weak. The role must fall to the House of Lords. Its standing must be raised to become the co-determiner of British law. The House of Commons must lose its power always to trump the Lords. That will require that the Lords is composed through democratic mandate. But to avoid relative party strengths predetermining outcomes so that it becomes a mere simulacrum of the Commons, there need to be substantive innovations. The first is that a critical mass of Lords – say, a third – must be elected as independent crossbenchers in order that the government of the day must win assent for its legislation through force of argument and not political arm-twisting. The second is that each nation and region of the UK must be represented as a nation and region, so that larger interests are considered. The third is that its select and working committees should be able to co-opt external experts as members.  Britain would then have a 21st-century democratic chamber of which it could be proud.

"Each day, as more names are added to the villainy index, the reputations of the MPs who disdained to join in the great fiddle rise in public esteem. The Telegraph calls them ""the saints"". But is it possible to be both virtuous and, as some of these saints seem to be, a specialist in state-funded nepotism? Hilary Benn, for instance, is one of many MPs who couldn't think of a better parliamentary assistant than the person he had previously married. Not that one can deny the economies that must come from key staff sharing beds, free food and stimulating dvds with their line managers. In fact, to listen to Margaret Beckett, explaining what fabulous value her husband Leo represents, being available to the minister at all hours, even on caravanning holidays, is to wonder why more public servants aren't encouraged to recruit within the home. Don't most of them have a spouse, child, sibling, or even, like Peter Hain, an elderly parent, who could use the money? Before the expenses debacle, Damian McBride's abject emails underlined the need for a purge of the legion of parasites calling themselves ""special advisers"". But even parasites must compete with other parasites. Has Mrs Chris Grayling, for example, encountered many pretenders to the role of hubby's helpmeet? MPs' patronage, under the guise of a ""staffing allowance"", is up there with their expenses as an insulting, salary-boosting scam parading as baroque parliamentary tradition. Even before they've got their heads round the moral complexities of not nicking stuff, MPs wishing to continue in that role should sack any relations in their employment and replace them with properly recruited staff, to be paid directly by the House of Commons.

"Bourgeois"" is rarely heard as a pejorative these days – usually it compliments a kind of French cooking – but this week Stephen Fry used it as though he were the last surviving member of the Bloomsbury Group. ""Let's not confuse what politicians get really wrong,"" the performer told a television interviewer, ""things like wars, things where people die, with the rather tedious bourgeois obsession with whether or not they've charged for their wisteria."" There spoke a man familiar with an expenses sheet and its printed divisions – vertical by date and horizontal by category (""Travel"", ""Entertainment"", ""Other"") – to be filled in with the little bourgeois lies that have helped sustain thousands of little bourgeois lives for several generations. It has been especially true of journalists. Fry said he had never met ""a more venal and disgusting crowd of people when it comes to expenses and allowances"", and when his pavement interviewer let out an affronted little squeak (""Oh, not all of us surely?""), Fry came right back with a winning mixture of confession and accusation: ""I've cheated [on] expenses. I've fiddled things."" Then to the camera or possibly its operator: ""You have. 'Course you have."" Of course we have; perhaps not all of us, but very many. Our venality usually began in small ways, the charge for a taxi, say, when a bus had been taken, but soon crept up the scale to include ""drinks with contact"" when there had been no drinks and no contact, and ""supper with MP Reg Smythe re Indian poverty (receipt attached)"" when the information from Smythe had come from a telephone call and the restaurant bill from lunch with a girlfriend. Anyone who worked as a newspaper reporter in the last century must have lied in this way occasionally. A few of us made it a daily occurrence: expense sheets recorded alternative and entirely fictional lives led in a great whirl of taxis, drinks and meals as we dug out a version of the truth that was, apparently, only available over alcohol and overpriced food and not from a sober hour spent in a reference library. Blank receipts were taken from friendly restaurateurs and, eventually, taxi drivers (until the 1990s, claims for taxis needed no supporting evidence); first-class fares were paid out for second-class rail journeys; car mileages exaggerated; newsagents' bills enlarged to cover favourite but inessential magazines. Then there was the ""pink slip system"" whereby a cash advance against future expenses could be taken from the accounts department if you tendered a pink form with a sum of money written on it – £30, £50 or more – and an executive's signature. The executive, who could be very junior, would sign it without hesitation. ""Hi, Bob, could you sign my pinkie?"" And the executive would lift his pen abstractedly from the proofs he was reading and scribble on the dotted line, no questions asked. A system designed to meet the needs of a reporter who needed to get quickly to Heathrow airport or Huddersfield had been debased to an early form of ATM, used by anyone who needed ready money. It had a built-in inflationary effect, because when the day of reckoning came your submitted expenses would need – at least – to match your advances. Returning money to the company was unthinkable, for all we knew impossible. And the interesting thing is: we did not find ourselves despicable. We worked on a fine newspaper, the Sunday Times, and, after all, only some of our expense in the pursuit of our duties was fictional. Moreover, fiddling expenses was a craft tradition, and a much less damaging one (we told ourselves) than the down-tools antics and triple overtime of the printers several floors below. Journalists' memoirs tend to describe our greedy little scams fondly, as the trickery of strolling vagabonds rather than personal immorality, which is not how they could be depicted in the personal histories of vicars, chartered accountants or members of parliament. There was a long history. In Evelyn Waugh's Scoop, the foreign editor of the Beast tries to explain to the ingénue William Boot how he can top up his salary. ""Take a single example,"" he said. ""Supposing you want to have dinner. Well, you go to a restaurant and do yourself proud, best of everything. Bill perhaps may be two pounds. Well, you put down five pounds for entertainment on your expenses. You've had a slap-up dinner, you're three pounds to the good, and everyone is satisfied … Or supposing you want to send flowers to your girl. You just go to a shop, send a great spray of orchids and put them down as 'Information'."" ""But I haven't got a girl and there are heaps of flowers at home."" On the Sunday Times 40 years later, everybody had stories about how they had been told to bump up their exes because they were charging too little (""Come on now – your predecessor charged £80 a week""). The writer Murray Sayle set out in his yacht on a transatlantic race with the last-minute purchase of a secondhand line: he boasted that he'd managed to write ""buying piece of old rope"" on his expenses claim. And yet the newspaper itself, in its reporting and opinions, was just as moralistic as the House of Commons. The paper corrected injustices and exposed untruths. Only very rarely did we reflect on our personal behaviour, as when Phillip Knightley, toiling to reveal the trickery by which the enormously wealthy Vestey family avoided British taxation, was taken aside by the paper's lawyer and advised to keep his own tax returns and expenses claims beyond reproach. I suppose we thought of ourselves as social guerrillas; that we might be Gandhians, personally exemplifying what we preached, would have been as rare a thought among us as among Westminster parliamentarians. Later on another newspaper it became one of my duties as an editor to endorse expenses claims for payment. Sometimes the claimant would wait for your signature – an awkward moment. The best thing to do was sign quickly. To scrutinise the sheet and its paper-clipped evidence was to suggest distrust, and we were all, after all, honourable gentlemen and women. Sometimes, however, the management would declare a ""purge"" on expenses and demand more vigilance. It could be like unravelling bad knitting; taxis taken to such unlikely destinations as the Foreign Office on a Sunday night; lunch with ""Hungarian historian"" where two people had enjoyed five soups, five steaks and five carafes. I gently pointed out to this particular claimant, an admirable, clever and impeccable moralist on the page, that he would need to try harder. In other words, lie better. ""Oh, I didn't realise you actually needed to check that stuff,"" he said. He'd been doing the same for 30 years. It was ""the system"" – a perk, just as the miners used to get free coal (and all gone now because newspapers are so impoverished). I imagine so many similar scenes at the House of Commons Fees Office. The slightly deferential questions from the parliamentary servant to the Hon Member; the wish to oblige him or her, to cut them the best deal; the confusion over new rules; the notion that you both belong to a cultish elite that vulgar outside forces are trying to destroy. To try to explain the consequence as ""an error of judgment"" is laughable. It has been like a giant version of the pink slip, a way of adding to your wage, month on month, year on year – grasped with the same unexamined conscience but with public taxation rather than Lord Thomson or Rupert Murdoch meeting the bill.",MPs expenses: We never found ourselves despicable,2009-05-15T22:54:59Z,Ian Jack,politics
"So is it over? The culture war between the Prince of Wales and the doyens of modern architecture has been running for a quarter century. It was supposedly ended on Tuesday night at the Royal Institute of British Architects in London where the massed ranks of the profession sat in dark suits and politely applauded. The prince's 1984 ""carbuncle"" speech depicted architects as self-obsessed popinjays strutting the streets of Britain, smashing and sneering at anything traditional and erecting cheapjack glass and steel memorials to their egos. It caught a public mood, not just for who he was but for what he said. It also struck a professional nerve. Those who consider themselves artists hate their work being discussed (as opposed to adored) by laymen, even when the work is as public as architecture. Architects see themselves as ­surgeons gathered round the body of the urban environment, unquestioned in their authority over it. The shamelessness of the prince's attack sustained decades of visceral hatred. Architects insulted him as archaic, luddite, whimsical, lost in translation from the middle ages. They seldom addressed his argument but claimed that he had lost them fees, and without being elected. He replied, in as many words, that they had lost him whole cities without being elected. The prince must be the last public figure to take architecture seriously. Perhaps that was why the RIBA audience received his half-kiss and make up so warmly. To a profession that often seems interested only in icons and cash – witness magazines such as ­Architects Journal and Building Design – he ­ruminates on style, tradition and ­context. In among the herbivore ­organics and ­holistics, he is clearly plugged into a public mood. So is the clash of the titans over? I think not. Tuesday's speech was an attempt to forge a consensus between the prince and those architects who win big public commissions and city centre renewals. The prince duly apologised for having, 25 years ago, ""kick-started some kind of style war between classicists and modernists"". All he wanted, he said, was to ""value the lessons of history"", to plead for an architecture of context, of ""natural patterns and rhythms … that respected courtesy, consideration and good manners"". I cannot see why the prince should apologise. His carbuncle speech was the call (among others) that saved Trafalgar Square from not one but two frigid glass boxes, and spurred a genuine debate about urban design, the better for being often bad-tempered. He made the British talk about beauty, a subject they hate. Architects, like Tate artists, revel in the barren thesis that beauty is in the eye of the beholder (and the RIBA). It is not. It is in the eye of everyman. The debate has never died. It is kicking dust down at the old barracks site in Chelsea, where a proposed cluster of towers in a park by Lord Rogers, in the style of postwar Roehampton, is pitted against a terrace by Quinlan Terry in the even older style of Wren. In support of the latter, the ""unelected"" prince has written to the unelected owner of the site, the Qatari royal family, while the unelected architects have written to the unelected press. Never has the concept of franchise been so abused. Despite a plea for a few joint seminars, a hopeless gulf still separates the prince's argument from that of the modernists. The best line on Tuesday was from the RIBA's president, Sunand Prasad, that his profession had put behind it the postwar obsession with ugliness, traffic and grandiose planning as so much ""car-bungle"". But I see no RIBA truth and reconciliation commission, no inquiry into system-building or deck-access, into traffic separation or street-in-the-sky. Architects who welcomed the destruction of Georgian and Victorian neighbourhoods even tried recently to get the ""brutalist"" Robin Hood estate in east London preserved, as one of theirs. They know no irony. The energy-guzzling glass boxes, lumps, blobs and phalluses now emerging from architects' computer programmes show how little has changed. They stand empty in London's Docklands and the City, their cranes waving idly in the wind, like Shelley's trunkless legs of stone. Rogers's latest work, a bling apartment block for the Candy brothers in Knightsbridge – shrieking money – is wildly overbearing for its site. I doubt if today's Westminster ­planners know what that means. There is no meeting of mind or eye between such icons and the prince's plea for context and courtesy. There is no meeting of wood, brick and stone with cold steel and plate glass. There is certainly no meeting of skyscraper and curtain wall with Britain's urban vernacular of high-density, low-rise streetscape. It is as if Jane Jacobs, 1960s champion of the privacy and social cohesion of the city street, had never written. The prince is unfair in appearing to blame architects alone. All are subject to planning and thus to a political process. It is not architects who should be blamed for the carbon-wasting destruction of acres of central Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and elsewhere. The current Pathfinder demolitions in the Midlands and north, championed by Yvette Cooper as housing minister, were the result not of architects (though they were eager consultants) but of too much public money and political arrogance. Nor can the prince, whose constitutional power is zero, be said to ""abuse his position"" in commenting on style. He commands publicity, but so do architects, whose peerages, publicists and influential access have been deployed against the prince. As adviser to the London mayor, Ken Livingstone, Rogers vigorously fuelled the poor man's obsession with architectural virility. Like Lord Foster, he leaves the prince far behind as a master lobbyist. Provincial city fathers are often persuaded that a crazy skyscraper will somehow bring life to miles of run-down derelict land, yet the public votes for a quite different architecture when ­allowed to choose for itself. On the executive estates beloved of John Prescott as planning minister, they crave neo-Georgian, neo-Tudor, neo-traditional. They are derided by richer professionals who can afford the real thing for opting for ""pastiche"", yet they are seeking within their price range precisely the qualities espoused by the prince. Democracy is about choice. If architects were democrats, they would be with the prince. Many modern designers have worked well within the rhythm of existing city streets, from Terry Farrell's Covent Garden triangle to Richard McCormack's new BBC. Most do not merit naming, because their essence is discretion not ostentation. It is big money that seems to drives architects crazy, as it does bankers and politicians. The solution lies, as always, in debate and transparency. I am not aware of any choice of design being offered for the Chelsea barracks site to the public ­bodies which discuss it? Yet these are not esoteric games for drawing-room argument. They are the public realm. We can avert our eyes from most art forms, but not from modern ­architecture. Too much of it has ­devastated Britain's cities, making too many mistakes for the RIBA's Prasad to dismiss them as history. The ­profession's refusal ever to confront its past remains a scandal. It is not for the prince to make his peace with ­architecture. It is for architecture to make its peace with people. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com",Charles should stick to his guns.

"Private schools are closing or merging at the rate of one a week; there are just over 2,500 in the ­country, so in 48 years they could be all but gone. At the moment this is causing comment principally because teachers in the ­independent sector now face redundancy, but they at least have the option of ­being ­unemployed – those poor children still have to go to school, so the state system is squeezed. This is currently anecdotal – ­parent chatboards are abuzz with the topic. However, councils, while they will confirm that they are under pressure, generally have not had time to ­conduct any research into whether this is due to demand from parents who, in non-­recessionary conditions, would have gone private. It's not really in a ­council's interests to attribute the spike in demand to a temporary set of circumstances, either – if they are to put effective pressure on the Department for Children, Schools and Families for more funding, it has to be on the basis that this is a problem that won't go away. They prefer to cite high birth rates and smaller classes. There are subtle markers, however, that boroughs are facing private-sector overspill: in the London borough of Southwark, for instance, there is no shortage of places across the borough, but there is elevated competition for primary school places in the more affluent wards. In neighbouring Lambeth, the number of children getting into their first-choice primary has dropped from 80.2% to 74.5% (I should add that I still think that's pretty good, and these changes are not massive). I concentrate on primary schools, because decisions at secondary level are a bit more momentous, so take longer to reflect a change in economic conditions. My question is: why isn't there already in place some kind of formula that puts people who would normally be aiming for the private sector at the bottom of the waiting lists for the sought-after places in community schools? Never mind whether or not privateers (let's call them) are swamping state primaries now, or will be swamping them in a year, or aren't swamping them at all, or are merely displacing one or two children whose parents are committed to the state system. People who would prefer to go private waste no time at all explaining to you why: why their child is too gifted for the state system; why parental love is such an elemental force that considerations of civic duty are trumped; why it's not their precious parenting but the inadequate state system that has failed to head off the economic apartheid caused by private schooling. Finally, now, we have a new situation in which we don't have to thrash out those arguments again, in which we can start an entirely new argument. Let's say all of those things are true. Let's say the pupils at private schools are too gifted for state schooling; let's say their parents do love them more than regular parents; let's say the state sector is rubbish – if the queue for your local primary was too rufty tufty and not intellectually challenging enough before the economic calamity that was 2008, you can bloody well get to the back of that queue now. Yes, yes, this seems unviable and vindictive – but I think it is no less viable than the admissions process for faith schools – and as for vindictive, ha! Good. At the very bottom of the waiting list, put the kids who have been removed from a private school, since the intentions of their parents are the most transparent: somewhat above them, but below everybody else, put the kids who have siblings at private schools; also near the bottom, put the children whose parents' first choice was a faith school. (I've always thought atheists rather spineless – why have we not established faithless schools? We could get funded by taxpayers while bypassing those inconvenient government guidelines meant to ensure money is spent in an equitable way. And we could have Richard Dawkins's face made into a crest.) There are other questions an admissions process could use to whittle out privateers. Do they have a 4x4? Can the parents provide a letter from any local leftwing organisation, attesting to their commitment to open-access state education? Did they go to any meetings? This argument has been dominated for too long by binary positions: opting out versus opting in; faith schools versus non-faith schools. So it's all been framed in terms of the regular state system being the one you'd want to escape. But of course there are schools of great excellence in this system, built by regular teachers and parents who were never trying to create an elite, who believed in parity. With that excellence now being recognised, and these schools in demand, it's time to defend their places for the bog-standard locals who were never trying to pay or pray their way out of them.

"The fury at the expenses scandal is rising – rightly so – and it's prompting some to contemplate desperate steps. Lord Naseby, the former deputy speaker of the Commons, says parliament should be dissolved and a new election called immediately. The commentator Peter Oborne says that nothing less than a criminal conspiracy to defraud the taxpayer has been exposed and that prosecutions should follow. Moreover, he suggests that Britons are now morally compelled not to vote for any of the main parties, so riddled are they with thieves (in the moral, if not legal sense). You can't help but be drawn to the severity of those sanctions, along with demands for the immediate resignation of Speaker Michael Martin and the sacking by the party leaders of those MPs who have so blatantly gorged themselves at the public trough. Trouble is, all those steps are in the hands of the politicians themselves. It's up to MPs to vote out Speaker Martin; it's up to offending members to do the decent thing and resign; it's up to Gordon Brown or David Cameron whether or not they sack their closest colleagues. None of which seems that likely. Of course, voters can simply punish the money-grabbing politicians at the next general election by voting for their opponents. But that means waiting a year. And it's a pretty blunt instrument: why should Labour supporters in Luton South have to vote Tory to unseat Margaret Moran, the woman who believed it was taxpayers' duty to pay for her third home – not in London or Luton but by the sea in Southampton? Not voting at all – as Oborne suggests – has the moral appeal of washing one's hands of the whole rotten lot of them. But the only beneficiaries of that will be the extremist likes of the BNP (who will surely receive a plague-on-all-your-houses boost in next month's European elections). So what are those outside the moral leper colony that is Westminster meant to do? In the United States, there would be at least two options. Outraged citizens might gather signatures for a petition demanding the ""recall"" of the person they had elected. Or, more simply and more likely, they could launch a primary challenge. That is what happened in the early 1990s when a slew of congressmen were found to have helped themselves to public cash in what became known as the congressional Post Office scandal. Those who sat on safe seats suddenly found themselves facing a rival for their own party's nomination. They were incumbent veterans who had grown complacent and corrupt, forced to fight for their lives. During the height of the Clinton vs Obama battle last year, I wrote here that we could do with a shot of primary magic to shake up and excite our politics. Now we need it to clean up our mess. Of course, introducing a primary system will take time. For now, we will have to make do with the next best thing: deselection. Local constituency Labour parties and Conservative associations should take a hard look at the Andrew Lansleys and Hazel Blears, even at the Alistair Darlings and Michael Goves – all named as players of the great parliamentary property game — and ask themselves if they really want to knock on doors for people who have been so keen to line their pockets at public expense. Activists could demand a new selection contest, offering new and untainted figures to replace those who thought it OK to claim for dog food and Tudor beams. Such an approach is suitably discriminating: there would be no need to challenge those MPs – and they exist – who have been scrupulous. Moran's nextdoor neighbour, the irreproachable Kelvin Hopkins, would face no such selection battle. And it would offer an alternative to voters that falls short of the nuclear option – voting for a party they don't like simply to rid themselves of an individual they can no longer trust. Deselection was once a staple of the Labour lexicon, back in the fratricidal 1980s. It's time to bring it back, across all parties – not to advance one partisan ideology, but to save the reputation of democratic politics itself.",Expenses abuses make deselection the natural choice | Jonathan Freedland,2009-05-11T13:02:43Z,Jonathan Freedland,politics
"Baffled? It's hardly surprising. On the one hand, euphoric stock markets, up more than 20% in two months, proclaim the recession is nearly over. On the other, dark stories circulate about the chiefs of the Bank of England worrying that the banking crisis is intensifying. One banker says the banks are back; another that there is no sign of light. One businessmen says he can see green shoots; another that recession is deepening. Whom and what to believe? The answer is that the situation remains very serious, very fragile, beset by risks. Recovery, when it comes, may not bring much in terms of new jobs and rising production. The threat of a Great Depression may be receding (but that's by no means absolutely certain) but this is hardly reassuring, the new prospect being a worldwide Great Recession. After all, shares two months ago were valued more cheaply than in October 1940 when there were fears of a German invasion. Now stock markets think the threat has receded, but only to a state of mass unemployment and protracted economic stagnation. Some relief, but hardly an occasion for wild celebration. On the plus side, markets have been reassured that governments will underwrite their stricken banking systems, a commitment made at the London G20 summit. Interbank markets worldwide are less stressed. Some of the sickening drops in production in Japan and elsewhere at the turn of the year were because retailers and distributors around the world were meeting lower demand from their stocks. That period of ""destocking"" is coming to a close; orders are beginning to be placed at factories again. That is reflected in less pessimistic surveys of business confidence and reports that the pace of decline is easing. On top of this, as I have written a number of times, it would be very extraordinary if the British economy did not stabilise given the scale of the stimulus it is receiving. Interest rates at 0.5%, a deep devaluation, a budget deficit of 12% of GDP, along with the Bank of England printing £75bn, injecting it into the financial system (so-called quantitative easing), and announcing plans to print a further £50bn last week, is about as much as can be done to stimulate an economy in recession. We know from other bad recessions – 1929-1931, 1979-1981, – that after 12 to 15 months the worst of the fall begins to ease. That is likely now. But that is about all one can say with any confidence. The scale of the British stimulus is an acknowledgement of the scale of the unprecedented economic catastrophe. I doubt that the Bank of England embarked on its second round of quantitative easing because it thinks a second British banking crisis is imminent, as some reports suggested yesterday; there would be storm warnings in the interbank markets if it were. Rather, it is acutely concerned, as it should be, that the British financial system is short of hard cash and lending capacity. The risk is that further problems in US or European banks may bring fresh contagion here. The US government is opting for what Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman dismisses as a policy of ""muddling through"", largely because Obama knows that winning more cash as ""welfare"" for bankers will be almost impossible to get through Congress. The compromise deal announced last week in Washington over how much money American banks had to raise to stay solvent was the barest minimum. Everybody has to hope it is enough.  European governments are even more complacent. The German financial markets last week were rife with rumours that undeclared losses of nearly a trillion dollars meant the German banking system is bust. France's is in no better shape. You might hope that other government were urgently dealing with toxic debts and being as aggressive as the Bank of England in printing money and injecting cash into their systems to reduce the risk of a further round of bank runs and bail-outs. No chance. All this is worrying for Britain for two reasons. The first is that any British recovery depends upon world recovery; the more that is at risk from banking crises elsewhere, the greater the chance of a second round of bank runs caused by confidence collapsing overseas and the more protracted our recession. The second is that we allowed our economy to be dependent upon overseas banks for supplies of credit – £700bn a year by 2007. Crippled foreign banks are being forced by their governments to lend in their home countries as a priority. Our banks have to close the gap and they don't have the capacity. For example, the FT manufacturing barometer for April showed a further decline; lack of credit is freezing the supply chain and procurement process with companies terrified that buyers don't have the cash to complete purchases. It is a form of bank run, but between manufacturers. Production falls, the worst since records began in 1968, are accelerating. What is needed urgently is more bank capacity. We need to create a network of public/private banks to support industrial and infrastructure investment and we need a wholesale transformation in the short-term, risk-averse way in which British banks have treated manufacturing companies for more than a century. Instead, we were treated last week to an ultra-complacent report on UK financial services by the chancellor and Sir Win Bischoff, former chair of Citigroup. The City needed more regulation to regain trust, it conceded, but then, as if the last 18 months had not happened, the government's job was to back the financial services industry as it stands, incapable as it is of supplying credit to British industry. Sir Win even complained about the City having to suffer extra taxes, as the government struggles to close its prospective £175bn deficit because of the very credit crunch the City has caused.  This is the heart of the problem. Today's recession promises to be as severe as that of 1929-1931, as the National Institute of Economic and Social Research warned last week. Recovery then was the result of a determined intervention in the banking system and wider economy that has insufficient echo today. Where is the equivalent of the Bankers' Industrial Development Corporation that spearheaded support for manufacturing in the 1930s? British banks were cajoled into supporting new industries and restructuring old ones. Ramsay MacDonald and Stanley Baldwin would never have put their names to a report like Bischoff's. Nor was that all. The government swung behind key industries even before the war so that between 1931 and 1950 there was an astonishing industrial renaissance. Whatever today's immediate economic prospects, the prospects for the next decade are sober – a government struggling to get its finances in order against a background of an economy whose consumers, businesses and banks are trying to work off the debts incurred in the heady 2000s. We need a mindset more like the 1930s – trying to develop our economy, encouraging innovation and insisting our banks serve business. Britain needs to think like a state committed to economic development. We are a long way from that. Hoping for green shoots because the stock market is recovering obscures the scale of financial and industrial restructuring that is needed.

"Gordon Brown looks more and more like the kind of pathetic animal beloved by Victorian picture-makers: like Landseer's The Stag at Bay, cornered in the waters of a Highland loch and about to be savaged by the hounds; or Holman Hunt's The Scapegoat, driven from the temple into the wilderness on the Day of Atonement to carry the burden of human sin. On Thursday night, Brown's fellow son of the manse, David Steel, told a BBC Question Time audience that he felt sorry for him. A good part of the audience applauded sympathetically. This may be partly explained by the fact that the programme came from Brown's Fife constituency, where last time round he had an 18,000 majority, but my guess is that the pity for him stretches well beyond Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath. Anyone who has fled from a school playground anywhere – eyes prickling from the taunts of quicker-witted though not cleverer children – must have some idea of how Brown feels after a session of prime minister's questions with the junior smart-alecs Cameron and Clegg. The anger with yourself that you couldn't get back at them; their unwarranted cruelty; the knowledge that a friend, supposing you still have any, will chide you for being ""too sensitive"" or that a parent will repeat that eternal saying, eternally untrue, about sticks and stones. And this playground business in the House of Commons is just a fraction of the hurt Brown must suffer. Every day, in every medium, a fresh tsunami of ridicule crashes down on him. How does he manage to carry on? Why would he want to? Before Brown, the biggest prime ministerial failure of modern times was widely reckoned to be Anthony Eden, under whose orders Britain disastrously invaded Suez in 1956. The tempting parallel is with Blair. Eden was notoriously handsome (women would swoon) and puffed up with a moral vanity that told him he knew best when it came to foreign threats to the British way of life. In Eden's world view, Egypt's Nasser was the new Hitler and, that being the case, it was excusable to cook up a plan of enormous deceit to get rid of him. The analogy with Blair's adventure comes as close as anything history has to offer, with the striking exception that Blair survived to win the next election and eventually resigned when Brown's fevered ambition could no longer be held at bay. Now, as the Brown months lurch on, it becomes clear that he and not Blair is Eden's true successor. The famous quote is from Eden's great rival, Harold Macmillan: ""The trouble with Anthony Eden was that he was trained to win the Derby in 1938; unfortunately, he was not let out of the starting stalls until 1955."" Eden's particular trouble was Churchill, who even at the age of 80 was giving confusing signals about when he might step down. He made it awkward for Eden: ""I don't believe Anthony can do it,"" he told his private secretary, Jock Colville. The Tory party, like Labour now, was divided by factions from the day Eden took office. Long before the ignominy of Suez, he felt beleaguered by real or imagined treachery. Donald MacLachlan in the Daily Telegraph coined a phrase that lives on. He noticed that a favourite gesture of Eden's was to smash a fist into an open palm, but the sound of actual contact was seldom heard and people waited in vain for the ""smack of firm government"". How mild this criticism seems compared with what Brown or any other modern politician has to endure, but it wounded Eden as part of what he called ""torrents of abuse"". The Suez debacle, of course, made his life a thousand times worse. Washington told him off, friends deserted him, Britain revealed itself to the world as a fallen power. Eden was ill and exhausted. How did he cope? His excellent biographer, DR Thorpe, discounts drugs, despite the many rumours. Eden, says Thorpe, began to take small amounts of Benzedrine only after the worst of the crisis; he was probably no more addicted to the pills than Margaret Thatcher was to whisky or Harold Wilson to brandy, and less so than Churchill to alcohol. Eden's preferred remedy was a fortnight's holiday at Ian Fleming's house in Jamaica. He should have resigned before he went and spared himself another 50 days of anguish; but he genuinely believed the ""responsibility of unravelling the situation"" was his. The notion never seems to have occurred to him that in the eyes of his party he was the problem. Self-knowledge tends to go fugitive in these situations. When, shortly before he became prime minister in 2007, I went to interview Brown at his home in Fife – Damian McBride keeping a watchful ear from the sofa – one quality about him struck me above all others. He hated ""appearing"". When the photographer arrived, he became intensely self-conscious. Previously, he had perhaps been a little hammy; now, looking at a camera, he was like a rabbit frozen by headlights. It seems an unfortunate quality in anyone aspiring to political leadership. Brown must have known this and decided, on balance, that a little personal torture was worth enduring for the sake of his greater ambition. His mistake was not to understand that self-consciousness wasn't a public-relations flaw on the same level as Michael Foot's reefer jacket. It was much more untreatable. It made him awkward. It spread unease. It meant that Brown desperately wanted a job at which a part of him would be profoundly unsuited: see YouTube. Blind ambition is the only phrase that fits, but the truth is that none of us wants to be seen as a professional failure. Ambition extracts an especially high price among political leaders whose vocabularies stress high-flying words such as duty, courage, destiny and fate. When the Edens came home, his wife Clarissa noted in her diary, ""Returned to find everyone looking at us with thoughtful eyes"". He quit one month later, in January 1957, after a premiership lasting 18 months. All his successes came earlier as foreign secretary and later, in a rather smaller way, as president of the Royal Shakespeare Company and the MCC. His three-volume memoir made him the equivalent of £3m in today's money. He resigned when he was 59, which is the age Gordon Brown will be next February, a few months before the deadline for the next general election runs out. The ""thoughtful eyes"" described by Clarissa Eden belonged to a far quieter and more deferential society. More than 50 years later, the media is sleeplessly excited: emails, expenses, Gurkhas – how can thoughtfulness find a place in all this? But it still exists. It accounts for our pity towards Gordon Brown – if you prick him, and so on – as we wonder if, like Lady Eden, Mrs Brown is watching the people watching her husband and understands, also like Mrs Eden, that the public is pitifully glued to a ­developing tragedy.",Gordon Brown feels  the dread hand of sympathy | Ian Jack,2009-05-08T23:13:22Z,Ian Jack,politics
"Now somebody says it was actually Gaugin who cut Van Gogh's ear off, I realise how incredibly unlikely that ""I did it myself"" story was to begin with. Just thinking about the angle, and the unyielding gristle of an ear, should have made us pause. Yet Van Gogh's tale stalked its way across more than a century. The reason is that to fully appreciate someone's creative vision, we like to polish them free of any pragmatic impulses. The obvious first step is to establish an opposition between creativity and money – the ­latter is held to stand for practicality, self-interest, every­thing base and tedious about humanity. Ergo, creative ­people must be poor, just to mark their distance from corporeal reality. That's where self-harm comes in – the documented hurting of oneself is proof of superhuman liberation from self-interest. Unfortunately, self-harm among real people more often than not coincides with self-esteem and depression issues, in the grip of which it's hard to get much painting done. Alcoholism is a good self-destructive second fiddle, and critical circles remain gripped by a passionate, rueful admiration for any artist prepared to drink ­himself or herself to death. You simply don't get the same tenor of respect for alcoholic politicians, or doctors, or pilots. Addiction as self-destruction is also unlikely to be discredited by academics. Gaugin may now diminish Van Gogh for us, but it is unlikely that anyone will unearth evidence showing that Byron wasn't a boozer, and Thomas de Quincey never really took opium. The whole self-harm paradigm is a bogus component of creativity, which we cling to for another reason: aspiration. How much more satisfying it is, to yearn for a personal fulfilment that changes the course of history and needn't interfere with extremities of foolishness and/or hedonism. How much better than that pesky other theory, that genius proceeds from incredibly hard work. Even though it comes from the same source – a need to idolise and idealise the artist – the unease we feel at seeing creative people money-grubbing is more rational. Take the Young British Artists: the movement reflected urgent greed as a point of principle. Its radicalism, innovation and uniqueness all lay in overturning the final, essential truths of art: that it must be separate from commerce, and must exist wholly untainted by the market. The YBAs rejected these orthodoxies exuberantly, whether they themselves were motivated by cash or not. It was exciting to watch the old truths overturned, but it turned out those truths held sway all that time because they were true. Art and commerce should be separate. How do I know lusting after money is an impediment to genius? I know because of an instinctive revulsion at the sight of Tracey Emin cavorting with the Tory party. She voted Boris, hangs out with Tories, and thinks they would ""make a difference"". She criticised Gordon Brown for not taking enough pride in the arts. She is doing that poisonous, Jeanette Winterson manoeuvre where you moan about arts budgets on the one hand, and whinge about your tax burden on the other (where do these people think arts funding comes from?). Perhaps consistency is a bit 70s, but to build a reputation kicking down the ramparts of conservative sexual politics, and then start cosying up to the party that's still punishing single-parents and tossing away tax breaks on married people … is beyond inconsistent. It is thick. So, a new sliding scale of artistic authenticity: you don't have to cut your ear off, though it helped; you don't have to be an alcoholic, but you'll be in good company; you don't have to be poor, but you can't be rich; and you don't have to be on the left, at least not by current Westminster definitions; but you can't be on the right.",The Van Gogh way | Zoe Williams,2009-05-06T11:05:35Z,Zoe Williams,world
"As a consummate practitioner of public relations, David Cameron is famous for leaving no presentational detail to chance. So the scene at last week's spring conference - that fine crowd of senior men hailing their young leader in his pink tie - must have looked to him, as it was choreographed, just darling. Over at Mount Athos, it's gone down as their favourite spring conference photo, ever. Here, on the other hand, it was no time at all before the whingeing began. Where were the senior Tory women? Mr Cameron suggested that the scene had been wilfully misrepresented. Just because you couldn't see a woman anywhere near him didn't mean there weren't any there, did it? ""What you couldn't see were the four women on my other side,"" he wrote. And you should have seen the large ones, some of the most impressive women ever seen in politics, that got away. But all credit to Mr Cameron, the tableau was certainly an improvement on an earlier, though still better-known scene, in which he is surrounded by another group of smart, supremely confident young men. He said: ""We will change the way we look."" And he has. Hairstyles have been transformed beyond recognition since he posed with fellow members of the Bullingdon. And a neat lounge suit, as any Foxtons operative will tell you, always inspires more confidence these days than the waistcoat and tails of Cameron's early years. On the other hand, outside Afghanistan, there will always be the occasional nightmare buyer who insists on being served by a woman. Isn't it plain perverse not to cater for them? As we know, Cameron does not need telling. In his first appearance as Tory leader he said: ""We need to change the scandalous under-representation of women in the Conservative party and we will do that."" One thing his party has done, for example, is pay for advice from a consultancy calling itself Pretty Little Head, whose founders, Jane Cunningham and Philippa Roberts, keen students of evolutionary biology, specialise in telling businesses how to sell things to women. For instance, they have discovered, women are hard-wired to ""create a safe environment in which they, their offspring, and other people upon whom they depend, feel safe, secure and happy"". Or to put it another way, ""women do like shopping"". And women like frills, so why not present your products more prettily, like the White Company, with its tissue paper and ribbons? Women are suckers for that kind of stuff. ""What is actually being bought,"" say Cunningham and Roberts, ""is participation in an aesthetic that promises sun-drenched mornings and a crisp, clean world of calm."" Has anyone thought of wrapping Eric Pickles in a gorgeous, beautifully starched white tablecloth? ""Without wishing to appear cynical,"" say the consultants, ""this represents such an easy win for so many brands."" Or perhaps Eric should just be Eric? When they were advertisers, the same women made Dawn French the face of Terry's Chocolate Orange, the 900-calorie snack. Although evolutionary biology indicates that these would have been irresistible to a starving ancestor building up fat for the winter, a modern woman's susceptibility to the campaign probably depended on whether French, the comedian, doubled as her dietary role-model. At any rate, the York factory in which Chocolate Oranges were made has since closed down, with the loss of 316 jobs. As for the Tory party, it will have learnt from its marketing tutorials that it is easier for an organisation to flog stuff to women if it also employs them. So why not take the risk? ""An organisation that is overwhelmingly masculine in culture will inevitably project that bias through misunderstanding of, or insensitivity to, feminine ideals,"" the women from Pretty Little Head argue. Without wishing to appear cynical, this would be such an easy win for the Tories that it seems inexplicable they haven't bothered. Except that, to judge by his apologia, Cameron clearly thinks he has. ""In my private office,"" he declared, proudly, ""four of the most senior posts are filled by exceptionally able women who I personally appointed myself."" The fight against the scandal of female non-representation does not stop with hand-picked clerical staff. ""This is very personal to me,"" continues Cameron. ""I live with the embodiment of can-do, no-nonsense, female dynamism - my wife, Samantha"". What a pity that, unlike King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, with his 30 or so helpmeets, he cannot collect a few more. The more of these can-do embodiments of female dynamism the better. Admittedly, if it falls to the leader's wife to embody female advancement in the modern Conservative party, we could do a lot worse than Mrs Cameron, creative director of Smythson. She has a charming face and manner, and bag experts speak highly of the distended pouch known as the ""Nancy"", said to be her own design. But not much is known about Sammy's political leanings. Where would she cut public spending? Or does she, perhaps, sympathise with her mother, Lady Astor, in sensing that the fiscal calamity has been needlessly talked up? ""Even when one goes out to restaurants one finds that they are all full,"" Mr Cameron's mother-in-law said last week, ""so you do wonder where all this panic is."" Yet, for all this inspiring female companionship, Cameron's refusal to change his party's look in line with public expectations remains disappointing, if not - as his own women2win recruiters suggest - actually fatal to his party's prospects. ""We have yet to win back the female vote,"" say these designated missionaries, ""and continuing failure to do so will mean continuing electoral failure."" Why won't Cameron promote women? It can't be numeracy; this must be the last profession in which it is redundant. New height requirements, then? But the Australian politician Hajnal Ban has shown how simply, with eight fractures (four per leg) and some patience, a determined woman deals with that. Something else must be stopping him. Possibly, like the ""Punch and Judy politics"" Cameron denounced before mastering his own trademark blare, the misogyny that prevails in and around the Westminster yob house begins, after a while, to make the importing of external values look like an aberration. For a person who has, like him, gone native, the promotion of women in a place where custom dictates that they are, when not invisible, second class, may seem pointless. Even disrespectful.  Just as, once an MP has fully adapted to this foreign setting, it would seem obtuse not to shout abuse, spread damaging gossip, make threatening phone calls, bully colleagues, pretend your wife works for you, spend half the year on holiday, bang on about your family in public or call your sister's bedroom your primary residence for reasons that have to do with defrauding taxpayers. The only thing that could possibly exonerate Cameron for behaviour that seems to belong to a remote and backward culture that time forgot is that he does belong to a remote and backward culture that we pay for. And if it wasn't called Westminster, the anthropologists would be on to it like a shot.",Catherine Bennett: David Cameron - It's time to get in touch with your feminine side,2009-05-02T23:01:00Z,Catherine Bennett,politics
"The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Tuesday 12 May 2009. In the article below we repeated the legend that ""Milton earned only a fiver from the first printing of Paradise Lost"" (The age of the gifted amateur has returned, 2 May, page 31). Under the contract agreed in 1667, publisher Samuel Simmons paid John Milton an initial £5, followed by another £5 when sales of the edition were complete. We are in the twilight years of a certain kind of paid employment: the business of inking words on paper, to be read by a large audience that is largely unknown to the author. The crisis in newspapers is especially acute. But neither is book publishing immune. Advances against royalties are tumbling, staff have been cut, publishers take far fewer risks. The recession offers only a small part of the explanation. The fact is that generations are now growing up with the idea that words should be read electronically for free - a new human right - which has grave consequences for the people paid to compose and edit them. Writers and journalists like me, old enough to know manual typewriters, tend when we meet to congratulate ourselves on having seen ""the best of it"", meaning the years when a career could be based solely - mortgage secured, lunches enjoyed, etc - on small or large acts of English composition, often flawed. This way of living reached its full bloom only recently, between the late 1980s and early 2000s, when the enormous expansion in newspaper pagination and a burst of new lifestyle magazines increased the demand for wordage and publishers bid against each other to pay out large advances (the sums look incredible now - £500,000 for a first ""literary"" novel) for no other reason, it sometimes seemed, than to give an editorial director crowing rights over his rivals. What nobody considered (certainly not me) was that paid authorship rested on certain technical, social and legal developments, old but far from ancient, that were about to be undermined and overtaken by a new technology that was much more democratic. In other words, that paying an author to read his work wasn't an unchallengeable habit set in stone, like buying bread from a baker, but the result of two German inventions, moveable type and the rotary press, and two British ones, copyright law and that first large audience for print known as ""the reading public"".  Before Gutenberg devised his letterpress, literary production lay in the hands of scriveners, and writing was a spare-time hobby sustained by the patronage of the church or aristocrats. For a long time, the printed book did little to change this. Among writers, the play offered the best chance of a full-time writing career because a play had paying audiences - Shakespeare got a tenner for Hamlet whereas more than 60 years later Milton earned only a fiver from the first printing of Paradise Lost. By the 18th century, reading had spread from the aristocracy to the bourgeoisie. Alexander Pope received £5,000 for his translation of the Iliad when an agriculture worker's wage was 10 shillings (50p) a week, while Daniel Defoe wrote his way out of debt and had enough left over to set himself up in a country house in Stoke Newington.  But these were exceptions. Patronage declined, and the writer at the end of the 18th century was often poorer than his equivalent had been at the beginning. Books were luxury items. A literate craftsman on £1 a week was hardly likely to fork out 13s 6d for a copy of Tom Jones, which meant that its author, Henry Fielding, depended for his living on his post at Bow Street magistrates court.  Only with the swelling of the British middle class did writing become a real possibility as a career. In 1812, the editors at the Edinburgh Review reckoned that there were ""probably not less than 200,000 persons who read for amusement and instruction, among the middling classes of society"". The Review paid its contributors well; it was anxious to establish the writer as a professional. Walter Scott is the most famous example of a new breed, exchanging a legal salary of £1,300 for a series of furiously written novels that sometimes earned him £20,000 a year, a lot of which went into building his Gothic castle in the Scottish Borders. By the time Dickens, Balzac and Dumas were producing their highly profitable serial novels, the triangular foundations of the modern book trade - author, publisher, bookseller - had already been laid. Writers got advances against unwritten work and then flattered booksellers at ""trade dinners"" to persuade them to up their orders. A bestselling author could make a small fortune for his publisher: Byron for John Murray, Dickens for Chapman & Hall, the word of God for William Collins, who bought a country house and a steam yacht by selling 300,000 bibles a year.  Until now, remarkably little about literary production has changed. Some authors - JK Rowling is the modern Scott - generate big profits, while others - let's think of Ian McEwan as Byron - certainly earn enough to keep wolves from their various doors. A misleading idea has arisen, however, that writers generally can earn enough money to do nothing else. The idea is ignorant of history, of TS Eliot keeping himself comfortable on academic stipends and a publishing house directorship, of Angus Wilson superintending the reading room at the British Museum. It may be that we have it because authorship is now so visible, with the author turned into a small celebrity. But we can all be authors now and publish ourselves on the web. What you might call the moral and aesthetic case for writing - to think, imagine and describe and then communicate the result to an audience - can be satisfied online. It just doesn't make any money. The age of the gifted amateur is surely about to return. At British and American universities, this future has to be kept as a woeful secret. A great paradox of the age is that while newspapers continue their inexorable decline and publishing cuts its costs, journalism and creative writing degrees have never been more popular. Year on year, journalist applicants stood a quarter higher at 13,229 for courses beginning this autumn. Creative writing can now be learned at nearly every British institute of higher learning. Figures are hard to come by, but Britain is probably turning out about 1,300 ""creative writers"" every year.  Why do young people apply? Because they think they can be the next Zadie Smith. Why do universities encourage them? Because money can be made from fees. Is this responsible behaviour? We need to weigh the smashed hopes of creative writers against the financial needs of their tutors, who are themselves writers, and earning the kind of money that writing would never supply. A closed little dance: tutors teach students who in turn teach other students, like silversmiths in a medieval guild where a bangle is rarely bought though many are crafted, and everyone lives in a previous world.",The age of the gifted amateur has returned,2009-05-01T23:01:00Z,Ian Jack,uk
"There is a simple solution for the many parents who jammed TV switchboards to complain about the first showing of the cartoon advert for the morning-after pill Levonelle. The advert was shown post-watershed, but many teenagers still saw it. Perhaps in future the complaining parents should have their impressionable teens tucked up in bed by then, teeth brushed, lights out. Impractical? Not easy to get a teenager into bed that early? I understand. But then, if these parents have scant influence over the mundane bedtime aspect of their child's life, what makes them feel they can control the sexual part of it? First things first. Why wouldn't a parent want their teenage child to see an advert about the morning-after pill? Do they think this will be the first time they'll have heard of it, that, at school, or out with friends, all their precious, purer-than-pure darlings talk about is oiling their skateboards or getting up a campaign to bring back Follyfoot Then the dread day the nasty morning-after pill advert comes on screen and there's an anguished cry of: ""Mummy, they're putting sex thoughts into my head in a bad, accessible way."" Sweet, innocent teenagers everywhere collapse to the floor with an attack of the vapours. Dream on, mater and pater. The truth is that, one way or another, the vast majority of teenagers are already thinking about sex. To stop the boys in particular, you'd probably have to boil their brains in neat bromide. So what's so wrong about encouraging these young, hormonally driven people to consider contraception, even the morning-after pill, if necessary? Nothing, when you think about it, except perhaps that it jars with the modern British penchant for ostrich parenting. It used to be the children who couldn't bear to imagine their parents naked ""doing it"". Now it seems to be the parents squeamishly blocking the thought of their progeny becoming in any way sexually active, all of which is quite understandable and normal. Still, how deep into the sand do we want this parental ostrich neck to burrow? Indeed, it has long seemed bizarre that whenever this subject comes up there is only the same droning, judgmental talk of the wayward teens and the feckless ""bad parents"" who allow them to be wayward. Sure, they exist, but what about the other sorts of parents - the prudish, controlling, anti-liberal ""good"" and ""respectable"" kind? Aren't they part of the problem, too? What about those people, much given to panicking, screeching like some breed of middle England Amish, about TV adverts for morning-after pills, while all the time exuding a Victorian mentality that does their children no good and even slightly reminds one of Michael Jackson creepily putting covers over his children's heads? Continue down this route and what do we end up with? Short answer: what we've always had. Too many British teenagers who know nothing about sex, or protection, bar a couple of giggly biology lessons and any ill-informed gibberish they can glean from one another. Yet more groping, blundering, lost innocents who use the fingers-crossed method of contraception at a time in their lives when they couldn't be more fertile and end up hiding bumps under jumpers. Or tearfully confessing in time for their delightful pre-uni abortion, the one occasion there isn't a Hallmark card for. Yet. Is this what we are doing when we are ""protecting"" our teenage children from those dreadful, corrupting, morning-after pill adverts? Aren't we basically calling for an information blackout, harking back to the Dark Ages, instead of instigating something useful, the dawn of a kind of Stark Ages, of information, information, information, so drilled into our youngsters' psyches, that even when the hormones hit, they will have some chance of making it through? One really has to wonder what kind of ""good parent"" would want barrier protection against that? It's time for your happy pills, Hillary Should we start worrying about Hillary Clinton? In the middle of a speech about climate change, the US secretary of state suddenly pronounced it ""overwhelming, like trying to lose weight, which I know something about"". Hmm, disintegrating ozone, rising oceans, global destruction, the same as Hillary's struggles with her Spanx pants - you can see the link. Well, actually, you can't, but here's Hillary to illuminate: ""You think, oh, I only have to lose X number of pounds, but it seems such a faraway goal. It's kind of like world peace and so therefore why even try?"" Rrright ... ""Now Mrs Clinton, come this way, that man in the white coat wants you to sit down and take these pretty pills, after which you'll feel a lot better."" Happily, Clinton went on to see ""the point"" in both global warming and world peace but, dare we ask, what is going on here - has ennui finally hit home with our would-be first female president, following that very public hammering from Obama? Or are we going too deep and it was just a truly killer fat day? Was Clinton subconsciously linking global warming to the diet pill, Alli, just on sale in the UK, which has generated widespread anecdotal controversy all over the internet for bringing on certain noxious emissions of its own? It's along the lines of: ""It's great, it really works and I'd tell you more but unfortunately I've just gone and pooed myself."" Come to think of it, climate change, clothes change. Perhaps our Hills was right. Susan should be thankful she's not in The Apprentice Regarding Britain's Got Talent's Susan Boyle, you have to wonder whether public attitudes to reality TV are starting to verge on the surreal. The poor woman spent the week scurrying around, head bent, as furtive as a mass murderer going for sentencing at the Old Bailey. Her crime? To get a new hairdo, which upset people who keep harping on about how Boyle must remain unchanged, as if she were some kind of public woodland or listed building. This flags up the self-serving undercurrent in all this Boyle-worship: aren't we all super for loving her voice and not minding about her appearance? This has nothing to do with how Boyle looks, but how we think we look (the fabulous, non-judgmental British public). Talk about Gwyneth Paltrow's ""frenemy"" (the friend who was really an enemy); Britain is one big ""frenemy"" to Boyle right now, to the point where we get sulky when she attempts to escape from the pre-assigned role bestowed upon her by the media. Over on The Apprentice, the reality gets yet more surreal. It's one of my favourite shows, but what's with this year's sexist bullying? Maybe it's the editing, but Ben, a sprouting potato in braces, and Philip, the missing link that should have remained missing, are constantly rounding on female colleagues, shouting in their faces, in a way they simply don't with the men. Moreover, the female victims who've complained have been fired. Is this reality? Surely in the real corporate world, this kind of behaviour results in a tribunal?  Bizarre. How can people cry sexist when Alan Sugar inquires about previous contestant Katie Hopkins's childcare arrangements, but when it comes to all-out, misogynistic bullying, not a peep - it's just ""good telly"". Likewise, does the nation really care if a middle-aged churchgoer wishes to treat herself to a demi-wave? Basically, it boils down to experience. Long-time fans of reality TV such as myself know how to pace ourselves. It's a gift. By contrast, just like those kids said to be rotting their brains on Facebook, certain members of the British viewing public seem to be taking this kind of television either far too seriously or not quite seriously enough. Maybe it's time for reality TV to get a reality check. A dullsville shade of paler Hard to take seriously the news that Procol Harum have been fighting over who wrote dreary, overrated, prog anthem A Whiter Shade of Pale. Sure it's had a zillion radio plays, but Whiter ... remains the aural equivalent of falling face first into a pile of hippy vomit in the Green Fields at Glastonbury. Subtract money from the equation and they'd probably all be fighting to prove they didn't write it.",Barbara Ellen: Ostrich parents encourage teen pregnancies,2009-04-25T23:01:00Z,Barbara Ellen,society
"If analysts of the Susan Boyle phenomenon are correct, there has never been a better time to be weird looking. In hairdressers all around the world, women are praying that a cut ""just like Susan's"" will change their lives. Others may want to emulate the prominent journalist and Boyle supporter Tina Brown, who is rumoured to be growing her eyebrows out. What's the point of plucking? In a kindlier, post-Boyle world, people will see your inner loveliness shining through. ""We're all getting sick of being bullied by bad values. Sick of disappearing everyone who's plain or strange or not one of the cool crowd,"" Tina writes on her website on the Daily Beast. Susan Boyle, she adds, is an ""avatar of global yearning"". Over here, the former spin doctor turned BBC personality, Alastair Campbell, has also noticed that there once was an ugly duckling, with feathers all stubby and brown. What else can we learn from Susan? ""If there is a lesson from her success for politicians,"" he decides, ""it is authenticity. It is the only communication that works."" We can only regret that this epiphany occurred too late for a man who may be best remembered, when history is written, for his choreography of Tony Blair's specials. His diaries, The Blair Years, reveal a former commitment to authentic detail that once extended to making Blair swap his overcoat with a policeman's for a photocall in Moscow. A protesting Cherie called Campbell a ""total fascist"". ""I said there was no way he could wear that,"" the spin doctor records. ""Putin was looking on a bit bemused and TB, a bit embarrassed, said, 'He doesn't like my coat very much.'"" But for GB's advisers, there is still a chance to learn from Boyle's direct appeal to the public. Perhaps their new, intimate video, in which Brown shares his unpopular scheme to reform parliamentary expenses, will also allow an overwhelming appreciation of innate decency to sweep away vacuous conventions relating to personal attractiveness? At least, like the unfortunate decision to let us see what a handwritten letter of apology from Brown would look like, the film was presumably inspired by a belief in the prime minister's appeal as a man, rather than by a straightforward desire to evade democratic processes. In the event, the video met with such uniform popular revulsion that comments have been disabled on YouTube (although they can still be left after a doctored version, with canned laughter, entitled Gordon Brown Doing Stand-up). In his usual, Manichaean way, Brown revealed himself as the opposite of Boyle: an avatar of global gurning. In one respect, though, his achievement equalled hers. Moved by his performance, the nation spoke with one voice. ""Totally demented"", ""barking mad"" and ""this man is unhinged"" were typical comments on blogs of all political complexions. As for getting the message across: few people appear to have noticed, with so much else to distract them, that he was saying something about expenses reform being essential if young people are to be inspired to go into politics. Instead, viewers were mesmerised by Brown's idiosyncratic body language, in particular the lateral swaying and series of sudden, inappropriate smiles with which his little talk was punctuated, giving the impression of an unusually intelligent alien who has made a careful study of human beings, without ever having had the opportunity to meet one. Although there were complaints about Browns' artificiality, it seems unlikely that many of his viewers objected in principle, after so many decades of political image-building, to a prime minister being trained to act more appealingly in public. It was not the inauthenticity of Brown's performance that really annoyed his audience - even Susan Boyle is to be allowed some level of enhanced personal grooming - but presentational difficulties that appear, if anything, to be made worse by media training. We may not like Brown looking over-rehearsed but, to think back to his sullen, writhing days, we didn't like him natural, either. His predecessor, a born actor, obviously required little encouragement to strum on his guitar, talk estuary, press a humble teacup to his bosom, blink away a tear: whatever it took to make the nation's pupils dilate. But is the humanising of Brown so much more challenging than, say, the differentiating of Harold Wilson from Alec Douglas-Home? All that was required, in his case, was not wearing plus fours, a kickabout with some urchins and two accessories: a pipe and HP Sauce. More recently, Sir Gordon Reece had to deal, in Mrs Thatcher, with an imperious, piping voice, frightful hats and complete unfamiliarity with the real world. On paper, once he lost the Scottish accent, the reinvention of Brown would appear a relatively straightforward task. And from the latest video, it is clear that his failure in this department is no longer for want of trying - the pitiful smiling attests to that - but what worked for Mrs Thatcher never seems to work for him. You might almost congratulate Brown on a level of authenticity that is so resistant to Reece-like attempts to turn an awkward loner into a twinklesome people's friend. Except that nowadays the public is so rarely confronted with public figures who are not fluent, good looking or, failing that, young, that, even for a politician, any substantial divergence from TV presenting standards is a career liability. As much as presidents Berlusconi and Sarkozy have been mocked over here for promoting only the attractive, what other explanation can we offer for the existence of a Burnham, the triumph of a Cameron over a Gove, a Clegg over a Cable? There was clearly a time, pre-YouTube, if not pre-Obama, when some deficiencies in age, appearance and people skills were accepted, almost expected, in a premier. Of course, as Robin Cook told one broadcaster, there were limits to public tolerance: it was possible to be too ugly. But it was also possible to be too young, too well turned out and smarmily demotic. In the approach to Britain's first, proper, internet election, political requirements are changing. YouTube, for example, is for young people's gags and only the most assured or baby-faced politicians, if they are not there as jokes (like Prescott), look or sound good on it. Anyone else, as Brown discovered with his doomed bid for laptop stardom, is likely to be consigned to the outer circle of losers, into ""watching your dad dancing"" oblivion. Useless on it, but dated without it, Brown's difficulty with the internet points to yet another future recruitment problem. Forget expenses: questions of age, appearance and perceived oddness may put even more people off going into politics than Jacqui Smith's bath plug. With the internet demanding ever-improving performance skills from its principal actors, Westminster can only become less hospitable to people who look more like Menzies Campbell than Ant and Dec. Unless, that is, they can produce an official ugliness pardon from Simon Cowell and his authentic, travelling freakshow.",Catherine Bennett on YouTube and politicians,2009-04-25T23:01:00Z,Catherine Bennett,politics
"If politics were colour-coded, today would be the scarlet and the black. Scarlet for the red ink sloshing all over Alistair Darling's budget, forcing him to confess to borrowing levels that could reach £175bn the year after next - and black for the deep, dark hole that he and the rest of the government are standing in. But what of the way out? If Dorothy was urged to follow the yellow brick road, what path should Darling (tin man) and Gordon Brown (cowardly lion) take - and might the route be coloured green, with an unexpected hint of blue? There was a time when even to talk green at a time of economic meltdown would have been diagnosed as a sign of political madness. Surely what mattered were jobs - which will dominate today's budget - and homes, not the environment. Nevertheless, the notion that economy and ecology stand apart has been exploded. Credit goes in part to Rahm Emanuel, the hardball chief of staff to Barack Obama, who coined what is fast becoming the most quoted political aphorism of the age: ""Never allow a crisis to go to waste,"" he said days after Obama was elected. ""They are opportunities to do big things."" With that, Emanuel encapsulated what had been one of the new president's core campaign themes: that the economic crisis and the climate crisis had a common solution - massive federal spending that would simultaneously shift America's infrastructure towards low-carbon and provide millions of jobs. Obama's stimulus package went some way towards that goal, with about 10% of spending coloured green. But what about here? At first glance, the UK government's record looks stellar. Not only is Britain committed to an 80% reduction in carbon emissions by 2050, but Ed Miliband, the energy and climate change secretary, has imposed a stringent interim target, insisting that we cut our carbon output by at least 34% of 1990 levels by 2020. Today Darling will make Britain the first country in the world to introduce binding ""carbon budgets"", setting out exactly how much carbon the economy is allowed to produce over the next four years, starting now. If we overshoot, we'll have to pay, by buying emission allowances from other countries. That may sound harsh, but ministers have promised to spend £100bn on renewable energy between now and 2020 - so they reckon we can make it. There'll be more in the same vein, I'm told, when Darling announces money to develop not just one but several coal-fired power stations able to capture and store the carbon they generate rather than release it into the atmosphere - so far there is not a single such power station anywhere in the world - along with £4bn from the European Investment Bank for green energy. It sounds great. ""These are amazing targets, amazing acts of parliament,"" says John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace. The trouble only comes when you examine what exactly the government is doing to turn these admirable goals into hard, immediate reality. ""Then,"" says Sauven, ""you see a lot of holes."" It's partly a matter of money. The word earlier this week was that Darling would announce an extra £500m for reducing carbon emissions, including £40m on grants for renewable-energy technologies. That's peanuts compared to the scale of the task. Witness South Korea - an economy a fraction the size of ours - gearing up to spend £23bn on projects that aim to slash Seoul's emissions and position it as the world's leading producer of low-carbon appliances. But the reasons for scepticism about Britain's efforts are not solely about cash. Rather, it's hard to believe ministers are sincere about reaching targets - set for dates long after their political lifetimes - when they, to take the most neuralgic example, give the go-ahead to a third runway at Heathrow. Instead it encourages the belief that Labour is a lush shade of green when it's in the realm of rhetoric and the distant future - but the colour of concrete and tarmac when it comes to the now. So listen closely if Alistair Darling promises £5,000 for motorists who buy an electric car, along with a cash incentive for scrapping their old, gas-guzzling one. Even some government insiders admit it's an empty gesture. There are no electric cars to speak of, apart from the tiny G-Wiz (and that's more of a ""quadricycle"", says Greenpeace) and there won't be till 2011. What would be more meaningful is if Darling were to invest heavily in creating a network of plug-in charge-points around the UK, so that when electric cars finally arrive, we're ready for them. And such vehicles will only be green if they use clean electricity. Yet right now Britain languishes close to the bottom of Europe's renewable league table (just above Luxembourg and Malta) - even though we're naturally well off for wind power and other ""fuels from heaven"", as opposed to dirty, fossil ""fuels from hell"". We've missed our 2010 renewables target and are still deriving a measly 2% of our energy from clean sources. We should apply similar vigilance to any talk from the chancellor of home insulation. It's a good and necessary idea, but it needs to be on a massive scale - affecting millions of houses, not just a few thousand here and there under the odd scheme. We need to hear Darling offer both a serious scale of commitment and a big picture, holistic vision of Britain as a low-carbon society before we can believe the change is real. I'm told that the government got close to such a shift in last November's pre-budget report - only to back off and cut 2.5% from VAT instead. Why is green the right path for Labour? Partly because it would tackle the jobs crisis: insulating Britain's homes alone would employ tens of thousands of people and do so right away. Partly because it would re-tool the economy for the rest of the 21st century, when low-carbon nations will flourish while the fossil-fuel dinosaurs are left behind. But also, as Ed Miliband likes to say, because it's very Labour. It's about fairness, ensuring future generations don't pay for our folly, and about a task too big to be left to markets or individuals - one that has to be tackled by governments, working together internationally, especially in the European Union. This is not natural Conservative terrain. So much for the green path out of the black hole; what about that hint of blue? Tonight in London's Conway Hall Phillip Blond, whose recent call for a Red Toryism caused such a stir, will debate with fellow academic Maurice Glasman, who seeks to trump Blond's Red Toryism with his own coinage: ""Blue Labour."" Glasman suggests a return to the roots of the early Labour movement, with its initial focus on the small scale and local, on mutuality and equal representation in the workplace, on the integrity of the family. He argues that the Tories might want to claim the values of the old friendly societies and voluntary associations as blue. But they cannot: they are Labour's. True, they were lost in 1945 when the party became committed to ""the nationalisation of society"" - but they can and should be reclaimed. Both these paths, green and blue, would require a major shift by today's Labour party. But that's the advantage of being in a deep, black hole. Anywhere is better than here.freedland@theguardian.com","Jonathan Freedland: Labour's route out of the black hole has to be green, with just a hint of blue",2009-04-21T23:01:00Z,Jonathan Freedland,politics
"Paddy Ashdown was born a few hours after his mother was bitten by a rabid dog while shooting snipe in India, an incident she seems to have dismissed with aplomb. And this mix of swashbuckling insouciance and cheery pragmatism seems to have set the tone for her son's subsequent, rather extraordinary, life.  This is not really a political memoir at all. Ashdown's was not a classic political life - soldier, spy, politician, Bosnian hero, then almost envoy to Afghanistan, until President Karzai rejected him - but that is perhaps not the whole story. The man revealed here is that rarity - a politician not terribly interested in power - which makes this book very likable and rather frustrating. Those seeking Machiavellian insights should look elsewhere. What the book actually offers is a terrific guide to battlecraft, from how to deter jungle leeches to the importance of homebrew in wooing Lib Dem activists. The terrain varies from the Malaysian jungle to half-empty Somerset village halls, but what is always lovingly detailed is the planning of the campaign: scoping the target, setting tactics, leading the troops, charging towards gunfire.  What comes after victory (or defeat: Ashdown treats both with equanimity) does not much interest him. Had he ever won a general election, it seems not impossible that he would have handed over the Downing Street keys and thundered off to do something else.  His reaction when Gordon Brown offers him a cabinet job is horror; his 10 years as leader of the Liberal Democrats take up a dutiful three chapters, but are written with palpable impatience, as if he is itching to get this stuff over with.  Perhaps after his political diaries, this is just overly familiar territory. But he takes barely four pages to cover how the Liberal Democrats under his early leadership went from being virtually bankrupt and facing extinction to by-election revival, leaving the reader little wiser as to how it happened.  By contrast, he devotes many pages to explaining how he taught himself to make election leaflets, even buying an elderly printing machine nicknamed Clarissa, while stalking his Yeovil seat. This is not as boring as it sounds; Ashdown has a self-deprecatory sense of humour and a keen eye for the absurd.  But what he lacks is insight. The big turning points of his life are barely explained: why leave the military, which he clearly adored? What made him a Liberal? Why, even, have an affair with his secretary? How did his early life, which appears from brief, scattergun reminiscences to have been both wildly exciting and sometimes tragic, affect him? He argues that he lived like a ""17th-century merchant adventurer"", blown wherever the winds of fate took him, devoid of a plan. But impulsive or not, it is not that easy for a relatively novice MP to become a party leader by accident.  Some of the blanks are perhaps kindly: the book radiates admiration, tinged with guilt, for his wife Jane, a saintly background presence, who copes patiently with dysentery, poverty, death threats and activists. This might explain why he dismisses the affair with his secretary in two curt paragraphs. The omission of anything potentially damaging to Nick Clegg also seems carefully judged.  But his observation that ""I never much liked Westminster, and the feeling was, I think, mutual"" - referring ostensibly to the clubbability of political life - leaves one suspecting that Ashdown's political career was really an aberration. The emotional heart of his professional life seems to have been foreign policy. The book opens with a vivid account of two days in Bosnia, during the dark period when the west in effect abandoned thousands to their deaths and the section dealing with his time as high representative there suggests the disparate strands of Ashdown's life finally came together in a job he loved.  This is perhaps partly thanks to his evident love of the near-death experience - his only response to a €2m-contract taken out on his life in Bosnia is that it seems ""insultingly cheap""; towards the end of his political career, he perks up when his car is firebombed by a local thug. Hence the job he was perhaps born to do was the one he was prevented from doing: peacebuilding in Afghanistan.  A confidential memo on this conflict he wrote for Downing Street, attached as an appendix, reads as presciently today as it must have when it was sent in 2007, with its crisp assessment that the west would not win in Afghanistan at least until it redefined the idea of winning. Ashdown insists he didn't really want to go to Afghanistan, but as he ticks off the blessings of retirement - the garden, the grandchildren - one suspects a part of him still hankers for Kabul. And while A Fortunate Life speaks of a man content with his lot, what remains is a vague sense of dissatisfaction, crystallised in the postscript's admission that despite writing the book he cannot connect the 18-year-old self who left to join the Royal Marines with the man he is now: ""I have almost no idea how I got from there to here."" And after reading the book, neither, really, have we.  • Gaby Hinsliff is the Observer's political editor",Review: A Fortunate Life by Paddy Ashdown,2009-04-18T23:01:00Z,Gaby Hinsliff,review
"Without presuming to psychoanalyse Damian McBride, I imagine he is upset about the way he has been condemned by colleagues he recently believed to be friends. Has he considered therapy to help deal with feelings which may surface in the shape of obscenities, incontinent rage or other forms of unacceptable behaviour? By way of a first step, he might want to consult a new work by one of the country's best-known psychotherapists. ""If you are beset by clouds, do not despair,"" writes Derek Draper, in a characteristic line from Life Support. ""It may be hard to believe, but behind them your own personal sun is still shining, waiting to burst through."" None the less, Mr McBride will want to delve deeper into his ""negative dynamics"", as Draper calls them in a chapter called ""Dealing with the Past"". Are we talking about all-round gittishness here? Or could we be dealing with something buried in McBride's childhood? From his own trusted supervisor, Susie Orbach, Mr Draper says he has learnt to ask, in a negative dynamic situation, if ""anything else might be going on"". In Draper's case, he and Susie were trying to understand feelings of hostility towards Tony Blair, a man who was once his friend. ""So if you find yourself in a similar cycle of conflict, try and step aside from it for a moment and ask yourself that question: what does this person (or thing) mean to me?"" With a bit of effort, McBride may not need to undergo therapy. ""Some people,"" writes Draper, ""find that writing down their thoughts and feelings, either in a journal or just on a piece of paper, can stimulate greater understanding of why we do what we do."" In his case, routes to self-knowledge include the multiple, cross-referenced promotional identities featured on derekdraper.net and his contributions on LabourList, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, his incessant interventions on rival blogs (""I ask that you correct your original post by midday today or I will place this matter in the hands of my lawyers Schillings"") and the Draper-packed pages of Life Support However useless this assortment of banalities might be, Draper presumably derives comfort from setting down thoughts and feelings about himself: his fascination with celebrities, for instance, his birthday musings (""happy birthday to me!"") or his agonies over a ""major rejection"". ""Prior to that moment I'd been on a high,"" he writes, in ""Being Popular"", after being excluded from the Murdoch party at Labour's conference. ""A rejection like this can puncture our self-possession."" People who have suffered similar episodes of negative invitation may feel that an absurd oversensitivity on this point makes Draper the ideal psychotherapist for them. As Draper says: ""We are healers, not heroes"" and: ""There will be occasions when we are struggling with our own issues while trying to help our patients."" But still, given the explosion of demand for psychotherapy and the haphazard regulation of its 50,000 practitioners, it seems reasonable to ask how often and to what extent a healer is allowed to be reprehensible. We may accept a therapist who is, from time to time, bullying, boastful, greedy, shallow, self-obsessed, vulgar, unprincipled, childish and hypocritical. But should it be possible for Draper to work in mental health now he is known to endorse the use of mental health rumours as not merely an acceptable political weapon, but ""absolutely totally brilliant, Damian""? The British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, BACP, of which Draper is a member, will respond to complaints that he has contravened its ethics. Although (perhaps because it is thought to be confined to novels by Wilkie Collins) there does not seem to be an explicit prohibition against false allegations of madness, a list of desired ""personal moral qualities"" includes those of empathy and humility. But in the event that the BACP did exclude Draper, it would be possible for him to continue to practise as a psychotherapist or counsellor, since neither term is protected. Anyone in need of podiatry, on the other hand, can be reassured that Draper will never be allowed to mess with their feet. An end to his BACP membership would require only minimal adjustments to a professional website in which Draper is opaque about his therapeutic approach. ""The kind of therapy I practise rests on the interaction between two people as it unfolds in the therapy room,"" he says, mysteriously. ""I urge you to take that difficult first step and bring whatever is on your mind directly to me."" Well, Derek, what's on my mind is this: does anyone with a problem deserve to have you, after your second public disgrace, as their psychotherapist? Is there no presumption, in your line of therapy, of an enhanced degree of self-knowledge on the part of the healer? I notice that even though you have apologised to Labour supporters for ""juvenile"" emails, presumably written by your inner child, there has been, as yet, no similar courtesy to fellow practitioners of your day job. Admittedly, to listen to some of his colleagues, the inherent unpredictability of an hour with Draper would be part of the attraction of a therapeutic process that lies beyond definition, let alone questions of qualifications, conduct or humdrum notions of ""feeling better"". A government project to bring all psychotherapists and counsellors under statutory regulation has recently inspired an argument about the nature of talking treatments that is as revealing as it is bitter, even by the impressive attritional standards of the psychotherapeutic community. Negotiations between psychotherapists and their designated regulator, the Health Professions Council, had no sooner begun last year than anti-regulator Denis Postle compared participating clinicians to Nazi collaborators in Vichy France. A pained Mark Seale, chief executive of HPC, said he did not expect a spokesman claiming to represent ""a caring profession"" to resort to ""offensive and demeaning propaganda"". The therapist retorted that ""caring profession"" had nothing to do with it. ""My occupation is personal and professional development, with a special emphasis on group process."" Anyway, so far as an outsider can understand it, the camps are currently divided into 1) an alliance of psychotherapists who accept, grudgingly, the argument for protecting vulnerable patients; and 2) an alliance of psychotherapists who believe it is not in the nature of talking treatments to be susceptible to state-imposed regulation. ""Psychotherapy and counselling,"" says the anti-alliance, ""though usually helpful, are inherently 'risky'; they cannot be made to conform to safety-first culture."" It seems unlikely, then, that any of Draper's clients will be able to get their money back on the grounds of proven non-empathy, even if it was Mrs George Osborne and not them he had hoped to pass off as loopy. But - see the sun bursting through - his untouchability as a psychotherapist provides one of the clearest arguments possible for the proper regulation of talking treatments. And that is absolutely totally brilliant, Derek.",Catherine Bennett on Derek Draper's psyche,2009-04-18T23:01:00Z,Catherine Bennett,politics
"It seems like several centuries ago now – but around the time that Gordon Brown took over Labour's leadership, there was a lot of talk about an end to the clique-based warfare at the top of the party. ""No more Blairites, no more Brownites"" said the eternally optimistic Hazel Blears. ""We're all Labour."" But look what's just happened. No sooner had the Damian McBride story taken over the headlines than such hardened Tony-followers as Alan Milburn and Steven Byers were queuing to get on the radio and TV, and seize the opportunity to have a pop at their old enemies. Morale among these people is palpably on the up: come Brown's increasingly inevitable defeat at the next election, there will be a drive to get back to the certainties of the pre-Gordon era. It speaks volumes that, give or take renewed zeal, for supposed public service ""reform"", this won't be about any seismic ideological shifts; the key point is to secure the succession of the right faces: James Purnell, say, rather than Ed Balls. Meanwhile, debate about the state of the Labour party has become so dried-up and rancorous that you cannot shine light on one faction without a chorus of accusations claiming you're only doing so at the behest of the other. Criticise supposed Blairites, and it's axiomatic that you have a Brownite axe to grind; have a pop at the prime minister and his allies, and you're doing the work of the restorationists. It's happened to me this week. In Wednesday's paper, I wrote a piece centred on the selection contest in the South London seat of Erith and Thamesmead, and what it says about Labour's tin ear for the public mood. Since then, the odd blog, article and email has offered the opinion that to express unease about what's been happening there is essentially to do the bidding of Brown's old henchman Charlie Whelan, so as to secure his favoured candidate the job and thus see off his Blairite enemies. In this reading of events, you are essentially either on the side of the angels, or an ally-cum-dupe of people with the same brutal mindset as Damian McBride, and the Erith and Thamesmead story is simply just another Blairite/Brownite tussle, with the former cast in the role of victims. This is so much nonsense. The piece I wrote centred on 1) stories surrounding the use and alleged abuse of postal votes, and 2) the damage that may be done to Labour if the job goes to Georgia Gould, the 22 year-old daughter of the New Labour high-up Philip Gould. Not that the point has been reflected in some of the subsequent comment, but the nub of the latter argument was simple enough: even if you're a paid-up believer that the Blair premiership represented a shining progressive age, such an apparently nepotistic move – let alone trying to sell a 22-year-old with a flimsy CV as a credible candidate for parliament – may well cause Labour electoral problems it can ill afford. While we're here, it's worth noting that the BNP is very active in that part of outer London, peddling the idea that Labour is now run by a distant metropolitan elite with no understanding of life at the blunt end. They are, I'm sure, watching the Erith and Thamesmead story, and drooling. Moreover, subsequent developments have proved that unease about what's going on defies any attempt to characterise it as orchestrated mischief. John Austin, the sitting MP, is no Brownite bag-carrier or Whelan-stooge, and he's just announced that he's writing to Labour's general secretary to demand an official investigation into the postal-vote allegations, as well as registering a complaint about a local appearance by Tessa Jowell. Neither do I count the Daily Telegraph as a slavish mouthpiece of the Brownites and their allies in the trade unions, but they've run stories this week on both Erith and Thamesmead, and allegedly rum doings in the Northern seat of Calder Valley. But here's the really crucial point. Back in the mid 1990s, both sides of New Labour's broken marriage co-operated in the capture of the Labour party, and its subsequent running along the most emasculated lines. They both briefed for England – and if the Brown camp's whispers seemed more poisonous, that was at least partly because they were usually on the back foot (there again, remember the once-ubiquitous charge that Brown was ""psychologically flawed""). As proved by such well-worn stories as the pre-2005 fiasco in the Welsh seat of Blaenau Gwent, both sides are well-versed in the art of stitch-ups, which go on – and are arguably getting worse. Take note: in very varied parts of the country and in settings that run much wider than selection contests, there are current allegations of Labour fixes that seem to point up one thing in particular: that as their power ebbs away, both high-up cliques are getting very panicky indeed. As ever, what remains of the Labour membership – let alone what academics call civil society – remains something to be feared and held in check; what matters is the preservation of power in the hands of people who number no more than a few hundred. If the Labour party is going to revive itself – indeed, if it's to survive – to imagine that a switch-back from one arrogant cabal to another is the key to its future is essentially to seal its fate. To paraphrase the old Socialist Workers party strap-line, what Labour needs now is neither Brownism nor Blairism, but what used to be called (and this may seem quaint, but what the hell) democratic socialism, with renewed emphasis on the 'd' word.

"Of what use to us, we Glasgow state secondary pupils, was a ticket to the Scotland v England rugby international at Murrayfield? The free tickets, provided by a naive, young, rugby-loving PE teacher, were part of his losing battle to persuade us to play this alien sport so beloved of private school games masters everywhere.  There was only one solution: a first-ever journey to Edinburgh where the streets were paved with shortbread and where, we had been told, the locals, never normally eager to part with hard poppy, would none the less pay over the odds for the tickets we possessed.  The trip was a resounding success. The prices we secured were enough to get us into Celtic Park for the rest of the season and we found that Edinburgh store detectives had all been trained by Inspector Clouseau. Fifteen summers more were to elapse ere next I visited Auld Reekie, but this lovely old city had found favour with me. As we made our merry way back west, exulting in our good fortune and joyously dodging the train fare by jouking in and out of the lavatories, we had the warm glow you get when you have just been to your severe but kindly maiden auntie's. The one with a past whispered about only when the sherries flowed at yet another family christening.  And though she had admonished you again for your slovenliness and checked that you had washed behind your ears, nevertheless she had that glint in her eye as she slipped a pound note into your hand and you just knew that once upon a time she had travelled with a native man-servant.  I harbour yet that same secret thrill whenever I sally forth along the M8, but recently it has become evident that my Edinburgh is hurting and the reasons why are not hard to fathom.  The hand-wringing and introspection started when the Royal Bank of Scotland and the Bank of Scotland began their swift and catastrophic collapses, revealing a core rotting with the sort of risky financial adventurism Edinburgh would normally disdainfully associate with we spendthrift and reckless Glaswegians. Until the last weeks of 2008, RBS and HBOS had stood like sentinels guarding all those values that Edinburgh held to be sacrosanct: thrift, caution and temperance.  Now they could not have been more mortified if they had found that grandfather had sold the big house in Bruntsfield and had been found blowing hashish rings into the sweaty armpits of a Turkish rent boy in a souk in Istanbul.  Yet the anger and recrimination over Sir Fred's folly is as nothing compared with the civic war that has been raging over the city's £100m tram system. It's unnecessary, it costs too much, it'll be a year late and Princes Street will be like a building site while the work takes place. Anyone who has seen what Edinburgh City Council has allowed to happen to their main street over the last 30 years may conclude, though, that a building site would be an improvement. Is there any other main capital thoroughfare in the world where such a divinely appointed vista of Castle, Mound and Royal Mile is faced with a scowling road of shops that resembles Bucharest High Street before the revolution?  When the Edinburgh latterati are not enduring a dark night of the soul over their banks and their trams, they can usually be heard clucking over the plight of the grand old Scotsman newspaper. And it's true, the old girl is having a torrid time of it. The circulation has collapsed and last week their financial masters refused to bear the cost of sending a football writer to Amsterdam to cover Scotland's most important match in years. It is not difficult to lampoon the douce citizenry of Edinburgh when they get like this. Indeed, it is not difficult to have fun at their expense on most occasions. As when you ask whose turn it is to purchase the next round of drinks and suddenly find that a terrible silence has descended, broken only by Craig and Charlie of the Proclaimers on the jukebox. Or when you discover that most have never been to Glasgow because they get nosebleeds at the Harthill services.  Yet in the 10 years when I laboured on their newspaper presses, I grew to love the natural reserve, the refusal to rush to judgment and the Presbyterian rectitude. These did not spring from an absence of warmth or affection, but simply a natural wisdom in Edinburghers' dealings with people as they assessed your fitness for their friendship. And when my Glaswegian ""How's it gaun'?"" gallusness required occasionally to be punctured, then there was never a shortage of kind volunteers. So it pains me to see my beloved capital so vexed. For once, not so very long ago, this beautiful old city took me in, gave me sanctuary, listened to my woes, took pity on me and set me on my path again. And now it is my turn to return the kindness. The douce citizens of Edinburgh must not worry about the trams, they will be a resounding success. More people will be inclined to travel on them rather than buses because their special routes will bear them to their offices much more quickly. Traffic congestion will be cut and with it pollution. They will be pleasing to the eyes. Just ask the people of Nottingham and Dublin, who are now clamouring for expanded routes, when once they were aghast at the very idea.  Nor should they be concerned about their newspapers; they have stood for nigh on 200 years and, like the foundation garments of a Morningside matron, they will not be down for long. And they must not fash themselves over their banks for they simply cannot have everything. Already they have the brilliant Scottish parliament building, every one of our national art galleries and the world's best music, art and books festivals. There are some things, though, that it would not be worth their while to covet. And so they must leave style to Glasgow, for we simply do it better.",Kevin McKenna on why Edinburgh will prosper again,2009-04-11T23:01:00Z,Kevin McKenna,uk
"So admit it, who found Jade Goody's funeral tacky? The milling crowds gawping at the white coffin bearing the ""Bermondsey Diana"". Doves released into the sky. The wreaths Goody chose to reflect her life (perfume bottles, cameras, ""East Angular"", ""Kebab"", ""Minging""). But if you sneered, you missed the point. The funeral, including the floral gags, did the job, reflecting Goody's gobby, ballsy, sometimes clumsy, cruelly truncated rampage through life and fame, allowing family, friends and public to smile a little as we said our goodbyes.  If that is what we were doing. For, with due respect, let's hope saying goodbye was what yesterday was all about, not only to Jade, finally resting in peace, but to all of it. And them. Mum Jackiey, with a paralysed arm, electronically tagged Jack, upset little boys, mawkish waffle about bodies laid out in wedding dresses, all-night vigils, ""final words"", the dark carnival of exploitation that surrounded Goody not only up until her death, but also, it would seem, beyond.  I saw nothing wrong in Goody's wish to make money for her sons by selling the rights to her death. The middle classes could flinch all they liked. Unless you grew up in poverty, it's impossible to comprehend how these early experiences lurk, like anxious, whispering shadows, behind every decision you make. By signing up for media exposure, Goody wasn't being stupid, misguided, attention-seeking - she was being practical, forward-thinking, a mum. To my mind, Max Clifford did not exploit Jade Goody - he empowered her.  That said, everything has its limit. Showing her sons distressed and sobbing on the Living channel wedding coverage was indefensible. The black-edged ""death edition"" of OK! while Goody was still breathing redefined the outer limits of wrong. And so it went on even after her death.  It would be heartless to judge Goody's mother or widower. However, with her daughter safely buried, will we need to hear quite so much from Jackiey? Likewise, did we ever need the daily updates on Jack's adventures with his electronic tag? Or headlines such as: ""I leave the window open at night so that Jade can fly in""? (Sorry - she's a vampire now?) Since Goody's death, the coverage has been creepy, tacky and, to be blunt, not what we signed up for. Which was Jade, her fight for life, her cruel leaving of it, not some posthumous circus, featuring bit-part players, willing and unwilling alike.  Maybe this is why Jade's ex, Jeff Brazier, wisely opted to keep his sons away from the funeral, flying them to Australia. Clearly he thought they'd had enough, as surely now have we. Jade is buried, gone. And as she was the point, the sun at the centre of this media orbit, without her, it stands to reason that all the other planets (people around her, stories, gossip, interest) must also fade. Otherwise, what is the next farcical step to being unable to let go - a camera stuck in the coffin so that we can watch the poor girl rot? A voiceover droning: ""It's what Jade would have wanted.""  As Goody is not around anymore to want anything, it should now be about what her children need, which is for all this to be over. And what's so bad about that? In those last terrible months, Jade achieved everything she wanted, and more. A 50% increase in cervical smears. A wedding that was a twirl around her own Disneyland. Her sons set up for life. A place in the public's hearts reserved for our more colourful eccentrics. She did it. Good on her. Now perhaps it's up to us to ensure that Jade really does rest in peace. Why put a pretty face on the true nature of domestic violence? Well done Keira Knightley for appearing in the latest Women's Aid domestic violence advert. Knightley may act like she's swallowed one of her bangles, but she did step up to the plate. Saying that, I can't be alone in having mixed feelings about the result. Knightley certainly doesn't deserve to be criticised as Anna Friel was for appearing ""battered and bruised"" in the 2007 campaign. (Are we saying that young and beautiful women aren't allowed to care about their fellow females?) That said, there is always the spectre of battered babe syndrome. Perhaps that's why I preferred the 2007 campaign. As well as Friel, it also featured, among others, Honor Blackman and Fern Britton, so more of an age range (more of a woman range, come to think of it). By contrast, there is something queasy-making about exclusively using nubile females for this kind of thing, as if they were the only types who ever get beaten up or who manage to look hot enough afterwards for anyone to care. Indeed, while it's understood that Women's Aid needs maximum impact for its campaigns, and Keira should be applauded, one wishes the end result was not so narrow, did not stand quite so alone, that there were more adverts, other scenarios, not just ""pretty girl gets hit"". While the battered babe has long been with us, from cinema (Isabella Rossellini in Blue Velvet, Susan George in Straw Dogs) to life itself (Sheryl Gascoigne, Ulrika, Rihanna), the very last place we expect or want to see her is in a domestic violence campaign. Women always fall for funny men? Don't make me laugh Enough! I am speaking of the latest ""scientific study"" proclaiming that women are more attracted to funny men. Why? Apparently because deep within our primal, fluffy brains women find funny men ""more intelligent, trustworthy and empathetic"". And it is this GSOH we ladies are eternally searching for in Mr Right, not good looks, charisma, interesting jobs, six-packs, own hair and teeth. Hmm. It's time men heard the terrible truth. Women have been lying. The truth is out. Women are easily as shallow as men. We made up all that ""the funny guy always get the girl"" stuff to make ugly, unsuccessful and/or mildly insane guys feel better about their chances. We figured this was better than ignoring them and turning them into serial killers. And why not? Men constantly opine that ""we prefer curves"", while continuing to chase women shaped like liquorice laces. It's these little white lies that keep both genders happy, albeit deluded. But it can go too far. Just as it is enraging when Kelly Brook is endlessly cited as ""proof"" of the male preference for the fuller figure (adorable though she is, Kelly does not represent the size 18 woman struggling to find something ""sparkly, with coverage"" for the office do), why are these ""funny guy"" studies always illustrated with pictures of Billy Connolly or Adam Sandler? Please explain how these rich, successful, talented, professional comics represent the average goon spouting punchlines in the pub? In reality, hearing that a man is ""hilarious!"" is guaranteed to give a single woman prickles of dread, and yet they're everywhere. Some men even seem to view ""funny"" as a fall-back option when all else (career, hair, teeth) fails, when genuine ""funny"" is highly prized by women precisely because it is as rare in men as genuine beauty is in women. So just as stuffing my ""curvy"" bits into Spanx pants doesn't make me Scarlett Johansson, liking to have a laugh doesn't transform a man into Chris Rock or Paul Merton. Now, gentlemen - have a GSOH about that. • Educationalists have slammed suggestions that we try a US model of ""bribing"" children to perform better in exams, saying it's a moral minefield. Moral minefield? It's not even new. British parents have been doing cash-for-grades deals for years. But there's no need to call it a bribe - unpleasant word - we prefer incentive.","Barbara Ellen: Now Jade's gone, let the curtain come down on the show",2009-04-04T23:01:00Z,Barbara Ellen,society
"Even by Scottish football standards it was a swally of Homeric proportions. The Rangers and Scotland captain, Barry Ferguson, accompanied by his team-mate Allan McGregor, started it at last Sunday at 4am and finished around noon. Most of the sessions I've ever been forced to sit through tended to start at noon ... Not only does Scotland do drinking sessions well, we have also perfected the art of moral outrage. Over the 72 hours since the pair's misdemeanours were revealed, the outpouring of indignation in the nation's public prints and on television has been sickening. The public hanging of this hapless pair makes the Salem witch trial the very acme of justice and objectivity. Ferguson and McGregor have been handed life bans from representing their country and have been suspended for two weeks and fined by their club. It is believed that neither will ever play for Rangers again. The players compounded their drinking crimes by being pictured giving the V-sign to a battery of photographers who were in their faces before the start of Scotland's match against Iceland on Wednesday night. It was a petulant gesture rather than the gross offence to public decency it has been portrayed as by the scribes and pharisees of the Scottish sporting press, none of whom needs lessons in how to conduct a bevvy session. It is a shattering blow to Ferguson in particular as he has been a Rangers player from his early teens and was groomed to become a future captain of the club. He is an excellent and thoughtful footballer who plays, at all times, with his head up, looking to make the searching pass. This makes him different from the usual assortment of scufflers and ankle-biters that Scottish football coaches, fans and writers tend to admire.  Ferguson's chest visibly swells with the pride of captaining the club he has followed since childhood and for whom he has always been a polite ambassador until his act of folly last week. Last season, while ignoring a number of injuries, he led his players to a European final, only the third Rangers captain to do so. None of this though was allowed to be entered on his behalf when the hanging judges donned their black caps. The Tartan Army jeered Ferguson and McGregor when their names were read out at Hampden Park before the match. Presumably they, too, had felt violated at the alcoholic excesses of these players. This from a group of people who rejoice in their reputation for emptying every European city they visit of all available liquor. Scottish football has a long and proud tradition of booze-drenched incidents, each of which has added to the gaiety of the nation. The finest one occurred in 1974 when the famed Celtic winger Jimmy Johnstone commandeered a rowing boat in Largs at 5am before realising, too late, that there were no oars. He should have been preparing diligently for a match against England. The coastguard had to be brought in and Johnstone looked a bit sheepish at breakfast the following morning. Luckily for the rest of us, Scotland were then managed by a gentleman called Willie Ormond, himself no stranger to the odd glass, and who displayed a sense of proportion tragically absent in our latterday inquisitors. A few days later, Johnstone duly inspired Scotland to a splendid 2-0 win over the English. He also flashed a very extravagant V-sign at the members of the Scottish press perched high in their Hampden ivory tower and has since been rightly lauded for his justifiable act of defiance. Barry Ferguson would have flourished under a manager like Willie Ormond and we would have a better international football team.","Kevin McKenna: Cheers, Ferguson, you deserve better",2009-04-04T23:01:00Z,Kevin McKenna,uk
"Not since the Book of Revelation flourished as a predictive tool in mainstream Protestant society have we felt such certainty about the way our world will end. We know it because we've seen it so often in films and television serials. The story begins with an event that causes interest rather than alarm. The source can be various: an unidentifiable plant species might be discovered in an English country garden, or birdsong could mysteriously fall silent in Patagonia. Human reason and ingenuity are still fully in control, and then suddenly not. Political leaders broadcast television appeals for calm - the best brains are working on the problem - but many people aren't persuaded. They begin to gather and demonstrate; and how pathetic and bewildered they seem, with their heterodox views of the best means of human salvation and their ingrained belief that ""the system"" they are protesting against still vigorously exists (little do they know it, but the system is just as fearful and powerless as they are). The camera sweeps across the crowd or perhaps different crowds - the subtitles identify New York, London, Rio, Mumbai. We see holy men closing their eyes and chanting, kids throwing rocks at the police, banners advertising Marxism and the vegan diet. Useless, all useless! By the film's end all will be dead, except possibly the good-looking actor who's carrying his daughter on his shoulders and knows what to do.  This familiarity with the early stages of the apocalypse in fiction has an inevitable consequence in fact. To participate in the past week's street demonstrations in London was - as my wife said to me last Saturday, turning the corner into Hyde Park - ""like being in a film"". Behind us, a trade union brass band played Sousa marches. In front of us a man wore a sandwich board: ""There's much worse to come."" Compared to the Iraq protests in 2003, it was not a big march and much less racially diverse. There were probably around 30,000 marchers, nearly all of them white.  What did we want? Oh, social justice, a sustainable planet, troops out of Afghanistan, an end to capitalist greed, and some of that homemade ginger cake that a girl was selling from a basket on the grass. What did we not want? Another copy of the newspaper produced by the Workers Revolutionary Party. What did we get? The high point came with a short speech by Mark Thomas that was both funny and passionate, ending with the instruction to go out and ""kill - kill, kill, kill - neo-liberal capitalism"". Very few people could have taken that awkward phrase and used it both with and without ironic quotation marks in the course of the same speech.  Then the rain came on and the crowd began to drift back towards Marble Arch. What had we achieved? The annoying thing, perhaps, was lovability. A rich mixture of environmentalists, trade unionists, and lobbyists from every cause to the left of Peter Mandelson had strolled down Piccadilly to Hyde Park accompanied by light music. However angry people felt about inequity, the unfettered free market, banks, bonuses and looming unemployment, very little of that found frightening expression. We were all kind to each other, and kind to the police, who were kind in return. In this way, we were an advertisement for a certain kind of British behaviour: the ""peaceful demonstration"" that never frightens the horses, loved and admired by all. We felt we were mainly reasonable people - ""decent"" is the adjective knocking to get in - but too various in our concerns and unsure of our demands. On the one hand, workers scared at the prospect of the dole; and on the other, climate-change activists who thought a sustainable planet could be achieved only by abolishing economic growth, which, if not the dole, surely means less well-rewarded work. We threatened nothing and nobody. Several newspaper columnists have made this point in a rather lordly way, decrying the eccentricity of many protesters and their ""lack of focus"", and the truth is that the demonstrations failed as a public spectacle, despite 122 arrests, broken windows at the Royal Bank of Scotland and the scrum caused by the police's ""kettling"" operation. But to anyone who had the time or inclination to register their unease or anger visibly no alternative offered itself. In any event, to judge from the size of the demonstrations there were few such people outside students and committed campaigners. It may be that we aren't yet as distressed as we thought.  I went down to the G20 summit on Thursday, through that strange landscape - the Dome, Canary Wharf, those decorative rectangles of water that started life as the Royal Docks - which now looks like so much evidence of Britain's latest, perhaps final, attempt to perpetuate for itself a leading economic role in the world (when I first came here, the docks were lined with white-hulled ships; throughout my life, it sometimes seems, Britain's day of reckoning has been one long postponement). Canning Town station was filled with police. Some demonstrators were searched and identified before they were allowed to leave to attend a vigil for the man, now known to be Ian Tomlinson, who died in the crowd on Wednesday. Already, his death had become the protest's key event. Elias Stokes, a student at East London University who witnessed it, told me the coverage had been misleading. Only one or two plastic bottles had been thrown towards the police medical team sent to his aid, and those were from the back of the crowd. Everybody close to Tomlinson was trying to help.  So far as I could tell, both sides on the platform behaved with dignity and restraint. The students had their bags searched and were given little slips of paper describing what had happened to them, under which law. Nobody said, ""But this is a free country!""  I walked down the dual carriageway towards the ExCel Centre. It was a lovely day. I met a 66-year-old Marxist from the far north of Scotland who'd travelled 650 miles by coach to be there; a Christian lady from Watford who thought government by the antichrist was a distinct possibility; and an American student bearing a placard with well thought-out messages, including ""An end to the policies that have China consuming too little and the US too much."" Outside the ruins of the Tidal Basin Tavern, the ExCel Centre not even in sight, steel barricades brought all forward progress to a halt. About 100 Ethiopians had gathered there to blow whistles and chant slogans against the treatment of the Ogaden. They were by far the largest group. No, none of this will have neo-liberal capitalism shaking in its shoes. I doubt that any G20 leader even noticed it. But neo-liberal capitalism is shaking in any case. The real fear prompted by this week's demonstrations is different: that, if the G20 meeting proves no more than theatre, they may be among the last of their orderly kind.",Ian Jack: Apocalypse now: please form an orderly queue,2009-04-03T23:01:00Z,Ian Jack,world
"We're not quite talking pitched battles outside banks - but nonetheless, thanks to rather more polite methods than those seen in London this week, it's all going off on the Wirral. In both the Merseyside borough's post-industrial badlands, and neighbourhoods that are all golf courses and double garages, mad blood has been stirring for months. There have been marches, 55,000 names on a petition, and a continuing intervention by the local government ombudsman. Some people are even talking about forming a new political party. The reason: a ""strategic asset review"" by the Labour-Lib Dem council that means the closure of nearly half the borough's libraries - 11 in all - by early July. There is festering local anger about culture secretary Andy Burnham's refusal to intervene, and things look increasingly grim, though the proposals' outraged opponents have one last hope: allegations that the obligatory consultation was so half-cocked that it should be subject to judicial review. This week, a Tory turned independent councillor, David Kirwan, served notice of a legal challenge, warning that if the plan prevailed the result would be a ""cultural desert"". For his pains, he was banned from the very places he was trying to save. Such is one drama within a chronically under-reported story. Fixate on Westminster and Whitehall, and you'd think that the age of austerity will arrive in either April 2011 (if Labour miraculously get a fourth term), or that little bit sooner, as and when the Tories usher in the era of fiscal conservatism. But for millions of us, cuts land is not a place in which we'll arrive a couple of years from now: we already live there. According to the Local Government Association, half the local authorities in England have shed jobs in recent months, and seven out of 10 expect to do so in the near future. Recession means demand for their most urgently needed services is up, receipts are down, and sizable increases in council tax are unthinkable. Ergo the municipal axe, and the newly familiar austerity. When it comes to libraries Wirral is by far the worst case, but it is hardly alone. Warwickshire's Conservative council recently pushed through a 35% drop in its book-buying budget. In Labour-controlled Nottingham, as well as lean times for such vital services as social care, planned council cuts of £14m will mean the shutting of one museum, shortened opening hours at heritage sites including the city's castle, and closure for at least two libraries. Swindon's Tory administration plans to shave £100,000 from its libraries budget: one place is about to shut, two more may do so, and there's a quest to find ""volunteers"" to run another.  As things stand, libraries will always be vulnerable. The Public Libraries and Museums Act 1964 compels councils to run ""comprehensive"" and ""efficient"" services, but what that means has never been made clear. Thirty-odd years of underinvestment has often led to libraries becoming so shabby and poorly resourced that warnings about their supposed unpopularity become self-fulfilling prophecies. Worse, many are housed in the kind of mouthwatering town-centre real estate that cash-strapped councils always want to sell off.  Which brings us to the question of national leadership. Last October, apparently to avenge charges of drift, the Culture Department launched its library services modernisation review in an avalanche of wonk-speak that suggested little understanding of what brilliant places libraries can be. Apparently, it's all about ""new business, governance and delivery models"" and ""relevant cross-governmental agendas"". There's a lot of emphasis on the idea of ""capturing impact"", which looks like another term for the grim stuff of output-specified monitoring - or, in plain terms, targets.  So, here's an uncomfortable truth: libraries will always fall foul of all that, highlighting instead the old-fashioned idea that though you might not be able to nail down why some things are necessary, that doesn't mean you won't miss them when they're gone.  Besides, if you want to look at the simplest measures of all, there is strong evidence that the recession is making libraries more attractive. Between September and December 2008, new membership of libraries in Cumbria was up 39% on the same period the year before. The borough of Westminster recently saw library visits rise 10.5%, or 634,000. This surely chimes with the details of millions of lives: I was recently one of those people who used to spend £20 on books I didn't end up reading; now I make weekly trips with my two-year-old son to the library round the corner. The problem is, as the downturn bites, I fear that library may eventually be gone - taking with it a share of our future prospects that might be infinitesimally small but could also be huge. The adolescent dropping in after school to borrow books of guitar chords could be tomorrow's hero of the so-called creative industries; the eccentric fella spending hours poring over technical manuals might just turn out to be the next James Dyson. Not that they seem aware of it in Nottingham, Swindon or the Wirral, but that's how important this is. john.harris@theguardian.com",John Harris: Our libraries are at risk - just when we need them most,2009-04-01T23:01:00Z,John Harris,society
"Are we supposed to be impressed by the aching worthiness of the gay icons exhibition recently announced by the National Portrait Gallery? Selected by a panel of 10 prominent gay people, including Elton John, Ian McKellen, Sarah Waters and Billie Jean King, there's is no Kylie, Judy, Liza, Barbra, Shirley, David and Victoria, Bette, Joan or Madonna to be seen. Instead, we get Nelson Mandela, Virginia Woolf, poet Maya Angelou, Enigma mathematician Alan Turing, sculptor Rosa Bonheur, cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, and so it goes on. A gently lapping sea of academia-pleasing, well-behaved, hushed library tone, don't scare the horses gay goodliness. There's a cursory sprinkling of Joe Ortons and Quentin Crisps to keep the people in the cheap seats happy, presumably so that the thicker, less moneyed/metropolitan homosexual can cry: ""Phew, I've heard of that one."" Clearly some point is being made that ""it's not all disco balls and Kylie"". Only Lord Alli opted for unashamedly populist choices such as Lily Savage and Will Young, and you can bet the rest of the panel were bitching about him behind his back. ""Did you see what Waheed did? He might as well have said Zac Efron. How mortifying!"" And if you think all this is anti-gay you're missing the point. To my mind, it is the thinking behind this exhibition that seems curiously homophobic. Granted, the full list has not been released yet. Moreover, the chair, Sandi Toksvig, said that the exhibition's aim was to challenge cliched perceptions of gay life: ""There is no such thing as a gay community any more than there's a straight community."" Toksvig also stressed that the struggle goes on, especially when nearly one in five mental health professionals admits, as they did last week, to attempting to ""cure"" homosexuality. Points taken, but still, did the NPG panel have to be quite this contrary and dreary? Elton namechecks a cellist but every time you see him, he's hanging out with Posh and Donatella Versace. And why not? Haven't gay icons routinely been fashioned from The Beautiful and the Damned rather than The Dry and the Worthy? Isn't this a tradition worth keeping? Arguably, the exclusion of obvious icons such as Garland or Minogue could be construed as self-hating, anti-gay in itself. Certainly anti a particular strain of gayness, a stern slapping down of ""queens and screamers"", almost as if they are the wrong kind of gay, throwbacks, embarrassments, who should quieten down, shut up. Which, ironically, is what homophobic elements of straight society have always wanted too. The NPG list also seems to replace old prejudices with a new one, namely that the only gay people who matter are rich, cultured, London-based and too individualistic to be lazily lumped together as a gay community. They're forgetting, perhaps, that away from their creamy, relatively easy existences, all over the country many young men and women, terrified, nervous, preparing to come out, would find the concept of a gay community less an insult than a comfort; that, similarly, some of them may prefer their gay icons to be shiny, obvious, easy to spot, rather than, as seems here, obscure, worthy and requiring extensive googling and/or a pass for the British Library. There, for me, lies the essential problem with the NPG list. Not only does it stuffily refuse to have fun (and we straights thought that was our forte!), it speaks only to the elegant, assimilated gay cream and leaves the rest, the less moneyed, metropolitan and established stranded. Just as those mental health professionals tried to cure homosexuals, it would appear that some homosexuals would quite like to ""cure"" a certain kind of gayness - to once and for all banish the brash camp, noisy and joyous to the gay cultural wilderness. So, yes we get it: for some gay people, it's not all disco balls and Kylie. But perhaps for others, it actually is and there's nothing wrong with that. Just fancy that - publicity-shy superstars. What twits I hope it would not be too unfashionable to beg for a merciful release from all the twittering about Twittering. Or would that be tweeting about the Twitter? Give me a moment to consult my diary to pencil in the cold day in hell on which I'll care. You can't blame ""yoof"" for this one. People into Twitter are the same people who fell for MySpace, in turn the people who used to project their holiday snaps on to walls at dinner parties. Every generation throws them up - painful, self-promoting bores, uber-narcissists to the nth degree, so fascinated by their every dreary, pointless move they can't believe we're not. Just last week, Ashton Kutcher tweeted wife Demi Moore bending over in her pants. Classy. Next, they ""couple-tweeted"" themselves dressed up in nun and bishop-type garb, clearly believing this to be ""like, totally hip and hilarious"". In reality, they looked as though they were en route to some sad, suburban swinging party. The only sane reaction is: ""Please keep your hideous relationship to yourselves."" The irony is that this pair represent the kind of person who would carp about press intrusion, just as other high-profile Tweeters (Stephen Fry, hang your noble head in shame) would probably instinctively balk at the notion of identity cards. And yet here they are, these twittering tweeters, or tweeting twitterers, famous and non-famous, basically tailing themselves, doing the government's surveillance job for them, acting as their own paparazzi. Indeed, in this, the golden age of the uber-narcissist, who needs outside forces to invade your privacy when you can do such a fine job yourself? Stop talking about 'date rape'. It's rape pure and simple A mere fortnight on from the case of John Worboys, the ""black-cab rapist"", can we really be seeing yet more police blunders, this time enabling Kirk Reid to attack at least 71 women in south London in a 12-year campaign of sex attacks? Elsewhere, a jury found 26-year-old chef Peter Bacon not guilty of raping a lawyer in her forties. She was so drunk she had to ask whether they'd had sex the next morning and then claimed she'd been too inebriated to give consent. In the end, it was decided that drunkenness ""doesn't necessarily affect consent"". Fair enough, except for the way the case seemed to be billed throughout as yet another woolly subdivision of ""date rape"" - a kind of ""too rat-arsed to say yes"" rape. It isn't morally blurred where this case is concerned (Bacon was innocent), but does provoke a few questions. Just how elastic is this date rape thing?  Does its capacity to cover numerous scenarios mean we should take it more (or less) seriously? Finally, and maybe most crucially, has the great date rape social experiment run its course? I'm an old-fashioned girl and I happen to think that rape is just rape. It's the crime of forcing someone to have sex against their will, whether this occurs in a dark alleyway or on your sofa.  Why, then, when rape is the most black and white of crimes, does society continue to insist on greying (blurring, over-complicating) the issue with a nonsensical concept such as date rape? As things stand, the widespread usage of the term date rape dovetails all too neatly with the suspicion that sex attacks against women are doomed to be taken less than seriously, especially by the police. After all, what other serious crimes are trivialised in such a way? Anyone ever heard of ""date murder"", ""date fraud"", ""date theft""? It's odd to think that if someone kills you or nicks your stereo on a date, it remains plain old murder or theft. However, throw a sex attack into the mix and - tada! - it's ""date rape"". Indeed, while the guilty sometimes gets away with rape, and the innocent are sometimes accused, surely it's time to accept that the term only serves to muddy what are already dark and complex waters. • More Hitler art up for auction, more learned crowing about how ""mediocre"" he was. Admittedly, his self-portrait resembles Tintin crossed with a sponge finger, but why do people love pointing this out, as if it somehow redresses the balance?

"King George VI was discovered dead in bed in the early morning of 6 February 1952. He was 56. A few hours later I was walking home at lunchtime with a few classmates from primary school. ""Look at that flag!"" one of them said, and we looked across the playing fields towards a cotton mill that had a flagpole on its roof. The flag was only halfway up the mast: ""It means the king has died."" This is my earliest memory of public death.  A period of severe public mourning followed. Cinemas and theatres closed, BBC broadcasts were restricted to news bulletins and solemn music. It would be impossible to live in Britain then, even as a six-year-old, and not recognise that a serious mood had been imposed and was, for many people, being fretfully endured. For every one of us this week who couldn't bear to read or hear another word about Jade Goody - we were absolutely up to here (the gullet) with her and her alleged significance - there would be somebody in 1952 angrily wondering when Abbot and Costello would resume at the Odeon. The difference then was that the grievous instructions arrived from above, by fiat, and not, as now, through a media anxious to feed and develop what it sensed to be a public appetite.  As to what the king died of and why he died of it, these things to most people remained more or less unknown. The king had long been known to have ""a lung condition"". Like his brother, grandfather and younger daughter, he was a great smoker and by 1952 the link between smoking and lung cancer had already been established - but not until several decades later were ""lung cancer"" and ""cigarettes"" and ""the king"" connected in the same sentence. This can partly be explained by the respectful reticence once shown towards the royal family, but with that explanation comes a more general and now faded idea of good behaviour involving stoicism, privacy and never mentioning the most dreaded disease by name.  Consider this scene from July 1952. The new Queen is staying with her uncle, David Bowes-Lyon, and hears that Kathleen Ferrier, the celebrated contralto, is spending the weekend nearby. She has 15 more months to live. The Queen sends word inviting Ferrier to sing for her. Ferrier obliges. After the recital, the Queen sits next to her on a sofa and, in the words of Ferrier's sister ""knowing the true nature of her illness"", asks her how she is. ""Just the odd ache, Ma'am"", is the reply. ""You have to expect these things.""  The contrast between Ferrier and Goody in terms of talent and achievement needs no spelling out. The second was an awkward, graceless, shouty woman who liked appearing on TV. The first had one of the most beautiful voices among classical singers in the last century. The conductor Bruno Walter said that the two greatest musical experiences in his life had been knowing Ferrier and Mahler - ""in that order"" - while to the critic Neville Cardus not since Ellen Terry had any artist ""been so universally loved""; by the time of her death aged 41 in 1953 she may well have been the most celebrated woman in Britain after the Queen.  But the more interesting contrast between Ferrier and Goody, and between then and now, is how the process of suffering has become a public act. Ferrier had feared cancer ever since childhood, when she saw a neighbour in Blackburn die slowly of it. Throughout the 1940s she'd worried about pains in her breasts. In July 1950, she went to a doctor and emerged shouting to her voice teacher, waiting outside, ""Look, Prof! He's given me a clean bill of health."" A wrong diagnosis, however. The next March she asked her assistant, who happened to be trained nurse, to have a look at a lump. A mastectomy followed. Ferrier wrote cheerfully to close friends about a ""rather formidable op"" to remove a ""bump on mi busto"", but then heavy doses of radium therapy began to exhaust her and in any event the cancer had already metastasised. She collapsed during a recording of Mahler's Das Lied von der Erde in Vienna. The femur in her left leg snapped during the second performance of Orpheus at Covent Garden in February 1953 - her last public appearance. She vomited in the wings, but with the aid of morphine took several curtain calls. She was dead seven months later.  And what did the public know of her disease during the years between diagnosis and death? Almost nothing. Ferrier spoke of her ""rheumatics"" and wrote to friends in America that they should ignore any ""malicious rumours"", behaviour probably motivated by a combination of subconscious denial and a fear for the truth's effect on her career. In May 1953, the Sunday Times wrote that during her last Covent Garden performance she had concealed from the audience ""the fact that she was suffering most painfully from arthritis"". It took death to prize out the forbidden word, and at first not extensively; ""cancer"" is hard to find in her anthology of tributes.  Her friends remembered, however, that she'd promised that when she recovered she would give a fundraising recital for the radiotherapy department at University College hospital, which had treated her kindly. A charity was established, the Kathleen Ferrier Cancer Research Fund. All kinds of people sent money; newspapers reported £5 notes in envelopes from pensioners in Huddersfield. Ferrier (like Goody) had touched the British public, but (unlike Goody) through her superb art rather than the depiction of her dying; through Blow the Wind Southerly and Gluck's What is Life? rather than a shaved head and a white wedding dress, though after her death those same songs took on a more resonant melancholy.  And yet in the end what does the difference matter? Ferrier was perhaps the first well-publicised female victim of cancer in this country. University College hospital now has both a Kathleen Ferrier professor and reader of Oncology. Thanks to Jade Goody, more young women are aware of cervical smear tests than ever before.  This week I tried to find the plaque to Ferrier that her biographers said had been placed in UCH's radiotherapy department - unsuccessfully because the hospital has been rebuilt. Watching people come and go through reception on those urgent errands that sooner or later we shall all be the object of, I thought of how many lives might have been prolonged, perhaps including Ferrier's, if so much earlier cancer had stopped being taken like a shaming secret to the grave.",Ian Jack: How suffering became a public act,2009-03-28T00:01:00Z,Ian Jack,uk
"Here we go again. The Scots want their chessmen ""back"". The little fellows sit glowing at the centre of the British Museum's exquisite new medieval gallery, opened on Monday. Pop-eyed faces peer from walrus ivory figures, mournful kings and queens, knights on jolly horses and obelisk pawns. The Lewis chessmen evoke long, dark, Hebridean nights, with candlelight flickering on the bearded faces of Nordic warriors. Gnarled hands move bishop-to-queen's-pawn-two, and fingers tighten round broadswords as someone grunts check in Norse or Gaelic. No sooner is this delight unveiled than Scotland's first minister, Alex Salmond, is on the warpath. Not content with winning back the Stone of Destiny (or of Scone) to Edinburgh in 1996 – ironically sent by John Major to atone for refusing devolution – Salmond wants chessmen. What will he want next? Will he take offence at London being the domicile of the House of Stuart and demand the return of the royal family? The chessmen, 93 pieces from four sets, were found near Uig on the island of Lewis in 1831. Eleven were sold to the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, which said it was unable to afford the rest. These 11 now reside in Edinburgh's National Museum of Scotland. A dealer stepped in and sold the remainder to the British Museum. There is a stronger argument for London demanding the 11 than for Scotland demanding the 82. More to the point, the chessmen are Scandinavian, almost certainly Norwegian. They date from the late 12th century when the Isle of Lewis was not Scotland but Norway, and were probably buried for safekeeping by a merchant en route to Ireland. Unless Salmond is laying claim to Norway, they are not his. Oslo should be demanding them back, or at least the descendants of the Viking colony on Lewis. Scotland's Elgin Marbles they are not. The trouble is that any treasure trove can become someone's crown jewels if he chooses to make it so. Nationalism is in the breast of the believer. That is why it never goes away, as all will attest who follow the tortuous stories of Elgin Marbles, Ashanti regalia, Benin bronzes, Maori skulls, Tasmanian skeletons and Hungarian crowns. The so-called Priam's treasure, looted from Troy by the German archaeologist, Heinrich Schliemann, has met with successive claims from Turkey, Greece, Germany and Russia, where it now resides. That is before American lawyers and DNA archaeologists discover Priam's real-life descendants, as they claim to have found Genghis Khan's. We hardly dare ponder the fate of the walls of Babylon or the obelisks of the Nile. The British tend to patronise countries that display an obsessive covetousness towards objects buried in the west's museum basements. But they are the most chauvinist of all. The British Museum would not allow Melina Mercouri even to enter its door because of her claim to the marbles. More recently, a xenophobic hysteria was generated by the museum establishment to extract tens of millions of pounds from taxpayers and lottery players to ""save"" the Duke of Northumberland's Raphael Madonna or the Duke of Sutherland's Titian. Neither was at risk. These treasures ""belong"" only to the world and if new nations, from America to Arabia, have the means to acquire them and look after them, as once did Britain, what is so terrible? Yet smaller sums were not found to keep in Britain Turner's beautiful picture of Pope's Villa, which had obvious domestic references. The truth is that Raphael and Titian were bigger names. The hoarding of pictures and objects in the world's grandest museums remains a scandal. What began as a desire to rescue and display has become an institutional craving to own. Only 20% of pictures in public ownership in Britain are on a wall. While others may be fragile, thousands of works are simply removed from view and buried. They would at least be seen and enjoyed were they in private hands. A report of the National Museums Directors' Conference in 2003 pointed out that collections are not held for any institution's benefit ""but for the public as a whole"". It proposed that works should be sold as ""a proper part of collections management"" where they were not ever displayed, and if disposal meant objects would be more widely enjoyed or ""placed in a context where they are more valued and better understood"". This proposal was disregarded. ""Saving for the nation"" has become code for a professional belief that anything hidden in a curator's store was better off there than when shared with the public: the ultimate conspiracy against the laity. Technical innovation means that many demands for wider dissemination of art and artefacts can be met, by travelling, lending, copying and putting online. An astonishing device now enables internet ""visitors"" to Madrid's Prado to call up its treasures and focus on their minutest detail. Facsimiles of the Lewis chessmen, visually indistinguishable from the originals, now glorify chessboards round the globe. Like casts of any bronze masterpiece (itself a cast), such copies convey the same aesthetic delight as the authentic work. Were this not true, there would be no market for art books. Some museums are changing. While it refuses to dispose of its vast store, the British Museum has taken strides towards regarding itself as an open resource: what its director, Neil MacGregor, niftily calls not just ""funded to show but funded to share"". It loans incessantly and has at last offered to lend the Elgin Marbles to Athens – the only obstacle being Greece's refusal to acknowledge London's ownership, and thus promise to send them back (for once in this eternal row, I am rather on London's side). Religious and political objects have been returned to Africa and Australasia, sometimes permanently, sometimes on loan. The fall of the Berlin wall led to much exchange of war loot between east and west Europe, including the Hungarian royal regalia, sent back from America. The Lewis chessmen are poor candidates for restitution. They are portable, easily copied and widely borrowed. In the last decade, the figures have returned to Lewis as well as visiting Edinburgh, Glasgow, various English cities, Washington and east Asia. They are stars of the museological jet set. This wider lending should help blow open the concept of the museum as just a storehouse and shrine. Objects can enjoy a partial repatriation to the places from which they were acquired or stolen. When the ""virtual visitor"" can go not only into galleries and halls, but deep into basements and reserve collections, wandering round objects and exploring details, some of the resentment at exclusivity might lessen. But the British, so avaricious of possession, should realise that museum collections can never be immune from nationalism. The mystery of the authentic survives. Peoples will want to have and to hold what they see as symbols of their territorial identity. Lindisfarne will always want its gospels, Egypt its Sphinx's nose, Athens its marbles and Scotland its chessmen. Copies or loans will never do. Blood is thicker than marble. • simon.jenkins@theguardian.com",Simon Jenkins: Hoarding of art by museums is a scandal,2009-03-27T00:01:00Z,Simon Jenkins,uk
"The Tories have hurled plenty of abuse at the government, but one attack hit hard, striking a raw nerve. It came from George Osborne, the shadow chancellor, last November, as he responded to the pre-budget report. ""In the end all Labour chancellors run out of money,"" he said with acid scorn, ""and all Labour governments bring this country to the verge of bankruptcy."" I'm told that sent a shudder along the Labour benches. One cabinet minister says he feared that Osborne's line might resonate with the public - because it seemed to express a truth. Denis Healey held out a begging bowl to the IMF in 1976, now Brown and Darling are presiding over the worst economic crisis for 60, if not 100, years. Others detect the telltale signs associated not only with a Labour sunset but with any government entering its final days. The serial revelations of extravagant expenses claims, ministers clinging to the letter of the law to justify taking large fistfuls of taxpayers' money, along with the allegations of cash-for-amendments in the House of Lords, recall unhappy memories of the dying months of the Major administration. Plenty of Labourites, from the government on down, are shaking their heads and muttering: ""So this is how it ends."" The result is tearoom talk about the post-election leadership, all predicated on the assumption that Labour will lose. Will it be Harriet, will it be Ed? Who will be the bearer of the New Labour torch, David Miliband or James Purnell? Or might wily Jack Straw surprise them all by playing the elder statesman? It's all good fun, in a miserable kind of way. Of course, the autumn 2010 contest will turn entirely on the scale and circumstances of the general election defeat that summer. If it's seen as a personal repudiation of Gordon Brown, that will make it hard for his longest-serving ally, Ed Balls. If, on the other hand, defeat is viewed as a verdict on Labour's too-warm embrace of neoliberal economics, that will hamper bearers of the Blairite brand, such as Purnell. The same is true of the ideological debate, if not civil war, that will surely follow Labour's ejection from office. How it plays out will depend on just what is seen to have failed: New Labour or market fundamentalism, or both. As it happens, that debate is already under way. It does not involve those at the top of party. They are suffering from what another cabinet minister calls ""governmentitis"": too consumed dealing with their own departmental briefs to give any thought to the wider political struggle (still less to the prospect of a three-week campaign against the Tories, a sense of distraction that might hand the opposition a key advantage). Instead it is those on the outside - either used-to-be's or hope-to-be's - who are making the running. In the former category comes the one-time cabinet minister Stephen Byers, who called yesterday for an end to the 2.5% cut in VAT and for a more realistic, less grandiose target than reshaping the global financial architecture at next month's G20 meeting in London. In the latter category are those looking further ahead, trying to chart a Labour course for the next few years, rather than months. Here an intriguing dividing line is forming, marked out by a single question: how should we view the current economic crisis? Is it a hurricane that has ripped up the entire neoliberal settlement of the last three decades - or a severe, but narrowly focused, gale confined to the banking sector? Those two positions are well represented in an exchange due to be published in Progress magazine between two men who share a Downing Street past and could well be an important part of Labour's future: the MP Jon Cruddas, who fought an effective underdog's campaign for the Labour deputy leadership in 2007, and Philip Collins, a former speechwriter to Tony Blair. Cruddas believes the economic calamity could not be more significant. He suggests that 15 September 2008 should be etched in the history books as the day the world changed. For that was the moment when Lehman Brothers declared itself insolvent. (Perhaps we should refer to it as 9/15.) Neoliberal economics cannot recover from that event unchanged, he says; it will have to be profoundly reconfigured, as will the relationship between market and state. Collins draws narrower conclusions. Yes, there has been ""a massive, colossal failure"" in the banking sector - ""but not in the market for, I don't know, crisps or haircuts"". In other words, Labour will err if it believes the crash of 2008 necessitates a root-and-branch rethink of capitalism itself. The financial services sector needs to be sorted out with more muscular regulation, he concedes, and there will be a case for similar action in other industries. But the answer will be deft regulation, not state control. This, then, will be a crucial fault line in Labour's future; where people stand will depend on their interpretation of the immediate past. Some will try to project on the two camps that form the old Blairite-Brownite allegiances, though Cruddas and Collins unite in wishing to bury those labels, along with any talk of old and new Labour. They might struggle. Cruddas and his allies in Compass want to put some areas of national life beyond the reach of the market, specifically public services whose ethos would be undermined by the intrusion of profit-seeking players. Collins says he is truly agnostic about who provides a service, whether it's a private company or a government agency; all that matters is that it's a good service. This has some echoes, at the very least, of old v New Labour. Still, some of the coming dividing lines - and the coalitions that form on either side - will be new. Both Cruddas and Collins are decentralisers, criticising New Labour for hoarding too much power in Whitehall. It's frustrating how this insight seems to dawn on political parties as they are about to enter office or leave it - but rarely at the height of their powers. The Blair-Brown era has been one of tight, central control, with targets and incentives emanating constantly from Whitehall. It will be refreshing if Labour's next generation concludes that that was a mistake, and vows to embrace not only devolution - a word that implies power belongs at the centre unless some of it is then ""devolved"" downward - but the much more radical notion of self-government. This approach holds that power starts at the lowest possible level, with an individual sovereign over his own body, and that it is gradually lent upward in order to achieve what no individual can achieve alone - by pooling sovereignty through neighbourhoods, then cities, and only finally at the national level. The fact that figures once associated with the left and right of the party now agree on, for example, locally elected officials having the right to raise and spend money, independent of central government, is encouraging. It suggests a new alignment, with the centralisers, both left and right, on one side and the dispersers of power, both left and right, on the other. Such a discussion will seem remote just now, with the economy in a ditch and defeat apparently looming on the horizon. But the time will come when Labour has to reckon with what exactly went wrong these last 12 years. Only once it reaches a settled view of that question can it possibly hope to ask for power once more. freedland@theguardian.com",Jonathan Freedland: Call it 9/15 - the day the crucial divide in the post-Tony Blair/Gordon Brown era took shape,2009-03-25T00:01:00Z,Jonathan Freedland,politics
"When I worked on this newspaper's Diary column, we used to have a notional pair of Diary tongs, which we affected to use for the handling of regular missives from Jonathan King, and any other items ruled too odious for epidermal contact. The tongs were called back into service this week upon the arrival of OK! magazine's ""loving tribute"" to Jade Goody - published beneath the cover line ""1981-2009"", despite her still being alive - but I'm afraid they felt woefully inadequate as a means of dealing with it. I had assumed I'd never be more depressed than when a magazine published an up-skirt picture of Britney Spears showing menstrual blood on her knickers, under the headline ""She's not pregnant!"". But life has a way of surprising you. Time was you went to OK! to look at pictures of Bobby Davro in his frescoed snooker room, or WORLD EXCLUSIVE coverage of Phil Neville's wedding, suggesting the magazine had fought off rival bids from the Washington Post and some Polynesian freesheet. But even the most cynical satirists failed to predict that the logical end of all the births and marriages buy-ups that have characterised this mad decade would be a magazine actually buying up someone's death. Despite only forking out for her wedding, OK! now sees Jade as its media property - a point it rammed home by refusing to allow Jade's close friend and biographer to attend her wedding on the basis that she worked for another magazine. The same demented impulse presumably led OK! to decide that the only way to avoid being scooped on the obituary issue was to publish it while she was still alive. But let's hear the justification. ""OK!'s tribute issue is a celebration of Jade's amazing life,"" it ran. ""Jade's family have spoken to OK! to reiterate that they understand the tribute issue and view it as being very kind to Jade. They would like to also state that they are extremely grateful for the support that OK! has provided during this distressing period."" It's the tone that sends you over the edge, isn't it? Tone can be the most powerful provocation there is, a fact which will be acknowledged by anyone who finds that richly ironic sign-off beloved of Vodafone customer services - ""Is there anything else I can help you with today?"" - is little short of an act of war. It's all down to the tone, of course. Yet is there a more repulsive, insidious tone in British public life than the fake concern that is the stock in trade of the celebrity magazine? Fake concern is the tiger economy of ghastly tone, and you really haven't died until you've read some monstrous mag hag's ""editor's letter"" expressing concern for Amy Winehouse, say, on a page littered with paid-for paparazzi pictures of said singer weeping half-naked on her doorstep at four in the morning after they've been ringing her bell all night. OK!'s statement turned out to be another of its gutter-bound little lies, because we have since learned that Jade's mother ""wasn't happy"" about the issue. Has the magazine finally pushed the fake concern tone too far, so that even those previously able to suspend disbelief can no longer ignore the naked inhumanity when it next rears its head? The uproar is encouraging, but it's hard to call. A trawl through the Guardian's comment boards confirms that there are plenty who feel personally offended by the manner in which a dying 27-year-old of not overwhelming intellect has chosen to live out her final days. Poor lambs; our sympathies must be with them during this distressing period. But Jade's last desperate decisions are irrelevant. If we are to have any semblance of a civilised society the same standards should be applied to all, as long they haven't broken the law, regardless of whether you approve of their behaviour. To claim that Jade ""deserves"" her obituary being published while she is still alive because she took OK!'s shilling for her wedding pictures is logically indefensible, and says infinitely more about the intellect and soul of those making the accusation than it ever could about her. In fact, the issue is now so open and shut that we can expect the Press Complaints Commission to do precisely nothing about it. Which leaves the only hope of formal redress in the hands of the OK! proprietor, Richard Desmond - the real vulgarian in all of this. Will he sack the editor, just as he should have sacked his Daily Express editor Peter Hill for the almost psychotically malevolent coverage of Madeleine McCann's parents; just as he should have sacked his Scottish Sunday Express editor for the week's other jaw-droppingly vile ""exposé"" of the surviving Dunblane kids? That he hasn't suggests this is exactly how Mr Desmond wishes his employees to behave in the pursuit of profit. Perhaps our only hope is that the great and the good with whom he likes to swank about at charity functions will begin to find these serial abominations shaming by association, and cast him out of their beau monde with whatever tongs are to hand. Nothing worse than people lowering the tone, after all. • Marina Hyde's new book, Celebrity, is published next month marina.hyde@theguardian.com",Marina Hyde: The Jade obituary issue just shows how deeply OK! cares,2009-03-21T00:01:00Z,Marina Hyde,uk
"Out of America, the news about newspapers has never been so bad. Last month the Rocky Mountain News in Denver shut up shop after continuous publication for 150 years. This week the 146-year-old Seattle Post-Intelligencer published its last copy and now can be found only online. Other titles are in their death throes. The San Francisco Chronicle hangs by a thread; the Philadelphia Inquirer and the Chicago Tribune are in administration; the New York Sun and the Cincinnati Post lie already in the grave. Many statistics can be summoned in explanation, but the two most striking are these. First, more than four-fifths of Americans aged between 18 and 34 say they never look at a newspaper. Second, the average age of an American newspaper reader is 55 and rising. From evidence of this kind, the writer Philip Meyer deduced that the final copy of the final American newspaper would appear on someone's doorstep in the year 2043. That prediction, however, came in a book, The Vanishing Newspaper, published in the sunny days of 2004. In today's blizzard it would seem safe to move this pathetic scene forward by at least 20 years.  The pattern isn't worldwide. In India, for example, a growing population with rising levels of disposable income and literacy has made newspapers more prosperous than ever before. But in Britain the signs are ominous. The plight of national newspapers - that is, those published from London - tend to command the most attention: can the Independent survive? In fact, throughout the rest of the UK about 60 newspapers have already closed over the past 14 months. More than 900 regional journalists have lost their jobs since July. Nearly every newspaper that has closed so far is a freesheet, founded on the now vanished profits of property advertising. They will hardly be missed. The next round of closures, if they come, will have more serious consequences; not just for the people who'll be fired, but for our understanding of where we live and what another American writer called ""the vital habits of democracy"", which are based around reliable sources of information, and then deliberation and debate.  Local newspapers are easily sentimentalised, especially by writers who used to work on them. I served my own apprenticeship on a Lanarkshire weekly, the Cambuslang Advertiser, in the mid-1960s. It was not a good newspaper. I didn't really know what I was doing. Most of the stories came from amateur correspondents who had other jobs. Sometimes there was such a shortage of copy that the space had to be filled by a half-page ad for Capstan cigarettes. The paper hardly equipped Cambuslang's residents for democracy's vital habits. Our reporting rarely inquired into local authority decisions; the most important news came from the small local court and the football team. When the paper closed more than 40 years ago nobody mourned, and the same may come true of some of the titles that exist today - those ghosts of evening papers in formerly purposeful industrial cities and towns, their pages filled with reports of stabbings, drug abuse and drink-driving that are such a base reflection of urban life and make their readers scared to leave home at night.  Newspapers like this, inspired by the sensationalism of their ailing big brothers in London, may dent the case for the local press but they don't by any means demolish it. Neither does the notion that the most serious function of local newspapers, as an examiner as well as a describer of the areas they serve, can be just as easily fulfilled by enterprising websites. The problem is money. Online journalism is cheap to produce because it depends so much on personal assertion and on untested information taken or supplied free by individuals, institutions and organisations. This may not matter if, as on the Cambuslang Advertiser, church ministers write the church notes. The trouble comes with what the New York Times knows as ""the journalism of verification"" - discovering information, examining it for its truth, narrating it in a comprehensible way. That kind of journalism can be enormously expensive. People need to learn it and be paid. The New York Times spends $3m a year on its Baghdad bureau alone. Covering the goings-on at a hospital trust or a council committee in Lancashire may come only to a thousandth of that figure, but somebody will need to be paid to scrutinise proceedings if the official version of events isn't to become the only version.  Extracting significant revenue from websites is a challenging business, even with a print edition on hand to provide the content and the marketing. A stand-alone website without public subsidy would find it hard to pay the wages of a single reporter. When it does its job, an independent-minded paper funded by advertising and paid-for circulation remains the best scrutineer of local life, though in the new atmosphere of sackings and centralisation - offices closed, subeditors transferred to regional HQs - certain fears and temptations have become obvious. The large profits made by acquisitive newspaper groups in the boom years were not reflected in journalists' pay. The average starting salary in what has become a graduate profession is about £15,000. A job in public relations for a local authority pays far more and has a far more certain future. Recently, two PR posts advertised by Lancashire county council attracted 250 applicants, almost all of them local journalists.  What happens next is more interesting, and well described in a piece by Jon Slattery for the National Union of Journalists' paper, the Journalist. Local newspapers often reproduce the press releases of local authorities unchecked and unchallenged as the cheapest way to acknowledge new information; written by former local journalists, its style fits perfectly with the paper's. Journalism is quietly migrating with journalists to the public sector, enabling (according to the NUJ) newspaper owners to make even bigger cuts. Slattery quotes an NUJ official, Miles Barter, wondering why ""the poor council taxpayers of Burnley and Accrington"" should subsidise the shareholders of newspaper chains such as Johnston Press and Newsquest.  There are still about 1,300 local newspapers in Britain and many of them remain gloriously committed to the particulars of their communities. Other than the people who work for them, who could really care if the Daily Star and the Sunday People vanished tomorrow?

"Hovering over Dubai is a cloud called nemesis. The first time I saw the place two years ago through a plane window, its towers were hovering in the heat over the desert, gulping up water and energy and fussed round by reputedly a quarter of the world's construction cranes. Even then the vision was unmistakable, of Ozymandias and his ""vast and trunkless legs of stone"". When prices go up, buildings go up. When prices come down, buildings tend to stay up. Until recently visitors to Dubai returned gasping. This was truly a city designed from start to finish by autocrats and architects. It was the last word in iconic overkill, a festival of egotism with humanity denied. It was an architectural chorus line of towers, each shouting louder and kicking higher. People were ants. Dubai must have as many publicists as it has towers. Business and travel journalists in need of a freebie can just call. So, too, did a stage army of British writers who went to last month's Dubai International Festival of Literature, pretending to discover that it was not a free country (and practises censorship) only after being installed in their luxury rooms. A ""tower of Babel"" of a place ""with neither charm nor character"", declared an ungrateful Germaine Greer. Even as the property market turned sour last autumn, the vast Atlantis hotel, built for $1.5bn with a whale shark in its swimming pool, was spending $20m on its launch party. Yet still the supplements and television contra-deals spluttered their superlatives - recently from a near-hysterical Piers Morgan. Every time the builder of the tallest tower in the world, the monster of Burj Dubai, sees the local ruler, Sheikh Mohammed Al-Maktoum, he is told to add more storeys for fear someone else may build an even taller one.  The stockmarket is down 70% on 2005's level, and construction has ceased on half the unfinished towers that stretch out into the desert. Eighty per cent of the population of Dubai are passing migrants who are there, like gold-diggers of old, only for the cash. The cash is going and so are they, leaving expensive cars in the street and at the airport, many fleeing possible imprisonment for debt. Consider, meanwhile, the city of Detroit. Here was another that rose on the shore of an inland sea, fuelled by the cult of hypermobility. With the implosion of the motor industry it has gone to seed. Houses are pictured boarded-up or selling for a dollar. Dogs roam empty streets. Wind howls through vacant shops. The unbelievable has come to pass. The love child of America's greatest postwar passion is preparing to die.  Detroit is part of a great country that has shown itself capable of rescuing even its rustbelt municipalities. But this depends on finding people who will live in a place from which most have fled. Luckily, much of Detroit is of low-rise plot housing that could be transformed at least into Bohemian neighbourhoods, like ruined New Orleans. No such option is available to Dubai. It is the ultimate Corbusian city, rigid in format and old-fashioned in conception, based on the grids and set squares of super-planners, and on grand symbolic buildings rather than intimate streets. It cannot respond to demand and supply for land and property, let alone to the wishes of free citizens. Human scale is confined to the Las-Vegas style replicas of Florence and Venice adopted by hotels that realise guests will not come if slapped constantly in the face by modern architecture. One business that cannot afford inhumanity is a hotel. Such cities are like the planned science settlements of Soviet Russia or the instant downtowns of American ""metroplexes"", in which people do as planners ordain. There are no visual surprises, no corners of privacy away from big brother or at least big car. Buildings are exclusive and architecturally defensive, like London's Barbican. I can only imagine that Dubai will one day be seen as a punctuation mark on the architectural follies of the past half century. This off-the-shelf city state has been built on laundering the profits of oil, drugs, arms and western aid. Its sheikh was not a complete fool, like comparable African and Latin American autocrats. He realised that city states cannot live on one product alone, unless it is money. Since he had no oil, he would drill for money.  Mohammed Al-Maktoum's failing has been his belief that megalomania is best when done big. He built a giant port and a giant airport, a giant stock exchange, giant finance sector and giant shopping mall. Dubai is a monument to big-must-be-beautiful.  During the gold rush the prospectors came. But as the rush wanes, Dubai is believed to be nursing the world's biggest per-capita debt. It may have to be bailed out by its neighbouring Gulf states, whose more prudent attractions Dubai tried to outshine; indeed, the process has already begun. Nothing can bail out a tower if there is nobody to live in it. It cannot be pulled down and Chipping Camden replicated on the spot. The same goes for thousands of villas and apartment blocks along the Gulf shore and on the artificial islands in the world's most boring sea. They will stand empty in the heat.  Most were bought as investments. The value of those investments has fallen an estimated 60% in just six months. If their emptiness reaches a tipping point where there are no neighbours, no shops, no services and no social life, they will decay, like downtown Detroit. Smart money says Dubai could survive as the playground of India, even if the oil money of the Middle East moves back to more salubrious Europe. This depends on India failing to supply its own playground and, critically, on Dubai surviving what could be a Muslim backlash against its hesitantly hedonistic western lifestyle. Rivals such as Dohar, Abu Dhabi and Bahrain - especially as they are now bailing out Dubai - may welcome its swift return to the desert ecology.  Just as visitors to the Middle East see half-built, mostly abandoned concrete housing blocks and barracks littering the landscape of Syria and Jordan, so the towers of Dubai will become casualties not of human greed but of architectural folly. Their lifts and services, expensive to maintain, will collapse. Their colossal facades will shed glass. Sand will drift round their trunkless legs. Animals will inhabit their basements. Thousands of residential properties, if occupied at all, will be squatted by a migratory poor, like the hotel towers of the Spanish littoral or Corbusier's blockhouses of Chandigarh in India. Refugees will colonise the camps where Indian workers have lived as they built Dubai. Gangs will seize the gated estates and random anarchy will rule the soulless boulevards.  If it is lucky Dubai will at least be a refuge from the political cataclysms that could engulf countries such as Pakistan, Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. But mostly the dunes will reclaim the place. In centuries to come, tourists will share with Ozymandias the message: ""Look on my works ye mighty and despair."" With Shelley they will see how, ""round the decay /Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare /The lone and level sands stretch far away."" simon.jenkins@theguardian.com","Simon Jenkins: As they did Ozymandias, the dunes will reclaim the soaring folly of Dubai",2009-03-20T00:01:00Z,Simon Jenkins,world
"Now they have their Joan of Arc. Those who have long claimed that the sinister, shadowy forces of ""the Israel Lobby"" pull the strings of US foreign policy at last have a martyr. Last week Charles Freeman, a former diplomat, said he would not take the job he had been offered, chairing the US National Intelligence Council: he had, he said, been the victim of a campaign of ""character assassination"" conducted by an ""Israel Lobby [willing to] plumb the depths of dishonour and indecency"". In a furious statement, he declared that the ""aim of this Lobby is control of the policy process"". Those who in 2006 lapped up the thesis argued by the US academics John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, attributing to the mighty lobby the power to divert the US from its own interests, seized on Freeman's fall as decisive proof. Walt himself declared: ""For all of you out there who may have questioned whether there was a powerful 'Israel lobby',"" he blogged, ""think again."" As the reception to the original Mearsheimer-Walt article showed, this is radioactive terrain. Those who wade in carelessly can find themselves burnt. The explanation is not complicated. The notion that Jews wield excessive power, and do so in mysterious ways; that they advance the interests of a foreign power; that they function as some kind of fifth column, and that as such they have often led their country into needless wars - all these are accusations that have been hurled at Jews going back many centuries. It should be no surprise that Jews' ears prick up if they think they can hear these old tunes hammered out once more. And yet, after several conversations with Israel supporters in both Washington and Tel Aviv, I have found no one who denies that Freeman was indeed the victim of advocates for Israel. It is quite true that many on Capitol Hill disliked Freeman's devotion to Saudi Arabia, the country where he had once served as US ambassador: he recently suggested King Abdullah be renamed ""Abdullah the Great"". True, too, that a critical blow came from Nancy Pelosi, the house speaker, reportedly outraged by Freeman's overly indulgent attitude towards China's rulers. But I'm reliably told that these lines of attack originated with the pro-Israel crowd. Nor have Freeman's character assassins bothered to hide their fingerprints. On the contrary, several have bragged about their role, among them Steve Rosen, a former official of the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, or Aipac, who launched the attack on Freeman.  Surely, then, as Walt claimed, this settles not only the Freeman whodunit but the larger question of the mighty ""Lobby"". Clearly it is every bit as vicious - and effective - as its detractors have claimed, able to derail even a new and popular administration such as Barack Obama's simply because it had the temerity to pick a man who had, among other things, condemned the Israeli occupation as ""brutal oppression"" - right? Not quite. The flaws in the Mearsheimer-Walt case remain as visible as when they were exposed by the Palestinian-American scholar Joseph Massad, Noam Chomsky and a clutch of other anti-Zionists. For one thing, if Israel and its backers really did control United States foreign policy, there would never be any divergence between them: Washington would simply do ""the Lobby's"" bidding. But that is hardly the case. One can go back to the mid-1980s, when Israel and its friends begged the Reagan administration not to sell Awacs surveillance planes to Saudi Arabia - to no avail: the Saudis got their planes. Or spool forward to 1991 when George Bush pressured Israel to attend a peace conference against its will and withheld $10bn in much-needed loan guarantees unless Israel agreed to freeze settlements on occupied land. You might mention Israel's proposed arms sales to China: Washington compelled Israel to back down, first in 2000 and again in 2005. More awkwardly, Israel has long sought the release of those who spied for it against the US. Washington has consistently refused. Chomsky asks a useful question. If the US has been led to behave the way it does in the Middle East by the cunning ""Israel Lobby"", how come it behaves the same way elsewhere? ""What were 'the Lobbies' that led to pursuing very similar policies throughout the world?"" As for the Middle East, Chomsky quotes the scholar Stephen Zunes: ""There are far more powerful interests that have a stake in what happens in the Persian Gulf region than does Aipac [or the Lobby generally], such as the oil companies, the arms industry and other special interests whose lobbying influence and campaign contributions far surpass that of the much-vaunted Zionist lobby ..."" The naive assumption at work here is that the American dog has no interests of its own, leaving it free to be wagged by the pro-Israel tail. It's a convenient view, casting the great superpower as a hapless, and essentially innocent, victim. But guess what: the US emphatically does have its own strategic interests - oil chief among them - and it guards them fiercely. Support for Israel as a loyal, dependable ally - ready to take on Arab and other forces that might pose a threat to those interests - has served America's purposes well. That's why the US acts the way it does, not because Aipac tells it to. Perhaps the most powerful example - if only because so many believe the reverse to be true - is the Iraq war. Plenty of Mearsheimer-Walt followers reckon it was the ""Lobby"" wot done it: it was Israel that pushed for war. But as Lawrence Wilkerson, former chief of staff to Colin Powell, and others have explained, Israel's leaders in fact repeatedly warned against an attack on Saddam, fearing it would distract from, and embolden, what it regarded as the real threat, namely Iran. As it happened, they were right. So the myth of an all-powerful Israel lobby, pulling the strings, is a delusion. But it's equally false to pretend that Aipac and its allies don't exist or exert genuine influence. They do and they play hardball, as the Freeman affair has vividly demonstrated. (Indeed, the negative publicity that has resulted may make this victory a pyrrhic one.) Viewed this way, clearly and through a lens unclouded by exaggeration and mythology, they are to be strenuously opposed. Their attempt to limit the voices heard in Washington is not just an offence against pluralism, it also hurts the very cause Aipac purports to serve: Israel. Aipac's approach - not so much pro Israel as pro the Israeli right wing - ends up pushing US politicians away from the policies Israel itself needs, specifically the dialogue with enemies and territorial concessions that are necessary if Israel's long-term future is to be secured. The good news is that alternatives are emerging. Founded last year, J Street styles itself as a ""pro-Israel, pro-peace"" advocacy organisation, thereby creating a space for those US politicians who support Israel but believe the policy of recent Israeli governments is hurting Palestinians and imperilling the future of the Jewish state. Aipac and its allies have had the monopoly on Israel advocacy for too long.

"This proposal would be both good policy and good politics. Good policy because ID cards offer no protection against terror attacks, as then home secretary Charles Clarke admitted after 7/7; their confidentiality guarantees are hollow, as the serial loss of government-held data proves; and they cost an estimated £6bn – money that in these straitened times we simply cannot waste on such hare-brained schemes. A promise to spend the money saved on an intense attempt to develop a low-carbon car – whether electric or hydrogen or something else entirely – would be good policy too. It could be modelled on the wartime Manhattan Project quest for an atom bomb: gather the best brains, give them all the resources they need and tell them they have months – not years – to solve the problem. If it works, you'd have made the single biggest contribution to fighting climate change – and restored Britain's manufacturing base, by reviving the British car industry, into the bargain. What's more, you'd have reassembled much of Labour's winning 1997 coalition: appealing to liberals, greens and manual workers – all at the same time.","Jonathan Freedland: In its next manifesto, Labour should scrap ID cards",2009-03-17T19:51:04Z,Jonathan Freedland,politics
"Is it possible to be too plain speaking? Harriet Harman sometimes makes you wonder. Uncomplicated by humour, intricacy and, for much of the time, any evidence of considered thought, her oratory exhibits an unwavering commitment to simple expression. One thinks, for example, of this recent comment on Fred the Shred's pension: ""It is not acceptable and therefore it will not be accepted."" Her feats of clarity have impressed even the Plain English campaigners. Three years ago, when Harman was minister for constitutional affairs, hers was the first department to publish legislation, the draft Coroner Reform Bill, with a translation into what she called ""ordinary English"" alongside the usual legalese. ""The aim is to link government more effectively to parliament and the public,"" she explained. ""All that most members of the public can do is listen to the debate professional politicians are having about the bill … so it's hard for people just to see for themselves what a bill would mean to them."" Which, when translated, turned out to mean: Ms Harman is preternaturally sympathetic to the interests of the Primark-going classes and therefore better suited than any of her rivals to be deputy leader of the party. Perhaps it is thanks to Harman's influence that the prime minister is also increasingly translated into plain English. Compare ""I wake up in the morning thinking what we can do to help"" with his allusion, in a speech delivered 1994, to ""post-neoclassical endogenous growth theory"". Abandoning the Ed Balls demotic, the prime minister now appears to take inspiration from an easy-to-follow book by Dr Seuss: Mr Brown can moo, can you? For example, in case the public should find it hard to process the meaning of ""I wake up in the morning thinking what we can do to help"", Mr Brown is careful to repeat the line almost every time he addresses the public. This way, even hardworking toddlers can understand that they are being patronised. It seems that one thing that occurred to Mr Brown recently, when he woke up in the morning, was a helpful fiscal procedure called ""quantitative easing"". He went and told Harriet Harman about it. A week or so ago, Harriet duly told the House of Commons that ""in respect of quantitative easing, the monetary policy committee has introduced up to £75bn extra that will be put in the economy"". Given Harriet's commitment to simple speech, as well as the airy way in which she made this incomprehensible announcement, it's possible she thinks quantitative easing is so commonplace an expression that any explanation would be an insult to the intelligence of ordinary people. Unlike the legal language in her coroners bill, whose translation, unfortunately, almost no ordinary people ever appreciated because the bill was all about tinkering with the legal system and therefore of interest only to lawyers. Quantitative easing, on the other hand, is of tremendous interest to anyone who thinks that the £150bn further agreed by Alistair Darling is a lot of public money and wonders where in the economy it is going to be, to use the technical term, ""put"". Maybe, since there are no clues from the government, we are meant to work it out for ourselves. We've most of us heard the word quantitative, or at least, quantity, haven't we? Plus, Boots is full of remedies for easing this or that. So put them together and what have you got? The product increasingly known as QE: a measurable amount of making something better. Perhaps it contains tea tree oil. At any rate, this balm sounds just the ticket if you ever have the misfortune to get mixed up in an extraordinary rendition. Sorted. Or it would be if some trusted financial interpreters from outside the government were not suggesting that QE is, in fact, a glib acronym for a Japanese euphemism for a potentially disastrous variation on printing money which has only ever been tried, with debatable success, in Japan. But definitions vary. Within Westminster, there was some confusion at a committee of experts about the exact relation between QE and the ""Asset Purchase Facility"" recently discussed in letters between Mervyn King and Alistair Darling. Aren't they the same thing, ie, printing money? Certainly not, sniffed one witness, the new deputy governor of the Bank of England, a Mr Tucker. Any new money involved would not be printed, he insisted, but ""created"". But could it, once created by a divine agency, be later turned into notes by some sort of sub-lunary outfit? Like a bank? An awestruck committee did not inquire. Even if the public is accustomed, by now, to looking up all the different kinds of City junk on Wikipedia, it is surely the government's responsibility to explain this latest bit of jargon, given that it appears to be Treasury policy, as opposed to a Ponzi scheme, or a CDO or some other demi-corrupt speculator device. Maybe it believes the concept is beyond us. Is it any more complicated than the Oxford professor for the public understanding of science, Marcus du Sautoy, explaining the surprisingly high probability of two people sharing a birthday? Or how about giving the job to the panel from Melvyn Bragg's In Our Time which recently did such a brilliant job with Schrödinger's cat? On the other hand, the cat theory does feature a cat. In all the jargon and circumlocution to emerge in this recession, the words quantitative easing stand out for having no ostensible relationship with the process they are meant to describe. QE looks less like a squalid official euphemism, along the easily decipherable lines of ""collateral damage"", than a piece of deliberate concealment. But you have to admire the skill that has gone in condensing such a wealth of artful dishonesty into two words or letters. Until now, the government's preferred technique, when troublesome information could not be straightforwardly suppressed, was to inter it within thick layers of protective prose. From the monster Hutton report, to the unspeakably written EU constitution turned Lisbon treaty, and Lord Stern's scary, strictly unreadable climate change epic, crushing tedium and dreary appendices have proved superbly effective diluters of democratic debate, even on the most urgent topics. At least the information was in there, somewhere. How, Harriet Harman would once have asked, can members of the public discover what QE means to them from a random pair of words, presented without so much as a footnote? It is quite a theme with Brown, these days, to deprecate bankers who ""did not understand the risk in which they were involved"" and to scorn anyone who contradicts his own analysis as a boneheaded liability. ""If you do not understand,"" he told the BBC's Julian Worricker on a supposedly empathetic phone-in last week, ""and others don't understand what the problem is we're dealing with, we'll never solve it."" Unless, as now, he manages to pass off his favoured solution, that of PM, as QE: a cross between a popular TV programme, our beloved queen and a generous dose of laxative. Every morning, when he wakes up, Gordon must think about this and have a right laugh.","Catherine Bennett: In plain English, Harriet Harman, you're taking the public for a ride",2009-03-14T00:01:00Z,Catherine Bennett,politics
"Margaret Thatcher is now taking her turn in the stocks as an originator of the recession. On the 25th anniversary of the coal strike, it is the fault of Thatcher and her battle with the miners. It is the fault of Thatcher, the deregulation fanatic. It is the fault of Thatcher and the idolatry of greed. Commentators of the left have pitted her against the noble miners' leader, Arthur Scargill, in coalition with Karl Marx, socialism and king coal. Can we not see they were right all along? The politics of blame has found its narrative. This one is drivel. British history is getting like Soviet history under the commissars, a prisoner of the world view of its partisans. To see Scargill's miners, of all lost causes, being trundled from their stables to do duty as prophets of the credit crunch is ludicrous.  The 1984 miners' strike was undoubtedly a climax in an economic revolution in Britain that began with Callaghan's 1976 admonition to the Labour party: ""You used to think you could spend your way out of recession ... this option no longer exists."" The catchphrase was adapted by Thatcher as ""There is no alternative."" It is forgotten today.  Following the deflation of the 1980 and 1981 budgets, Thatcher's battle with the miners did what was intended. It broke the economic power of the big unions at a time when they were weakened by recession. This made privatisation possible, aided by the financial institutions created by deregulation in 1986.  Nobody can seriously hold that Britain would today be better off with the industrial structure and restrictive labour practices of the 1970s still in place. Young people today can have no conception of the collective misery that was the British political economy at the time, of a nation dubbed the sick man of Europe, its commerce enfeebled by subsidies and class-bound management, its government in perpetual funk. My own industry may have its troubles but, until the Wapping revolution of 1985, it faced a wipeout similar to that which near obliterated the American and European press. As a result of Wapping, the British national press emerged from the Thatcher years with more daily titles than at the start. The Independent owes its existence to her, as its founder, Andreas Whittam Smith, has always accepted.  Where Thatcher - or rather her chancellor, Nigel Lawson - went wrong was in the reformed structure of City finance brought on by the Big Bang of 1986. I remember a director of the Halifax building society saying at the time, ""God help us if the bankers get their hands on our mortgages, or if our brokers get their hands on their deposits.""  He was right, but that was not for more than two decades. By then the market in mortgage-backed products was a global business. The 1986 reforms were robust enough to survive the recession of the early 1990s and stockmarket collapses before and since. They brought London a commercial pre-eminence that was inconceivable in the 1970s, when Frankfurt, Brussels, Paris and even Amsterdam were bidding to be the financial capital of Europe. Besides, 1986 was necessitated by changes taking place in competition law and in the US and Japanese money markets. London had to change or die. The credit crunch is proving rich in historical irony. No one was more traumatised by the miners' strike than two young Labour politicians, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. A year earlier, Blair had been elected for Sedgefield on a leftwing, anti-Europe, pro-union, pro-CND platform, to begin one of the most spectacular U-turns in political history.  By 1989 Blair was shadow employment secretary, and was demanding that his party quietly accept Thatcher's labour and privatisation laws. He and Brown visited Australia to study Labour leader Bob Hawke's ideal of Thatcherism with a human face. He declared, ""We play the Tory game when we speak up for the underclass rather than for the broad majority."" Meanwhile Brown demanded that the party ""make an almost religious atonement for the sins of Labour's past"", in the words of his biographer, Robert Peston. Brown was so frantic to mimic Thatcherism as shadow chancellor that Peter Hain wrote in 1993: ""There is little to distinguish Labour's macroeconomic policy from that of the Tories."" John Prescott, Jack Straw and David Blunkett dismissed Brown in Tribune as a crypto-monetarist. He was against tax rises, for privatisation and an ardent defender of Kenneth Clarke's Treasury policies.  This is only relevant since whatever blame attaches to Thatcher for the financial chaos of the last six months attaches even more to Blair and Brown. In truth, Thatcherism was a consensus, built on the experience of the 1970s as the consensus of 1940s welfarism was built on that of war. The difference is that Brown, in his semi-independence for the Bank of England, was super-Thatcherite. The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 established the tripartite regulation that has so conspicuously failed. It went far beyond what Thatcher would have tolerated. Her contribution to the political economy remains hopelessly misunderstood; her impact on labour and financial markets was emphatic, beyond anything attempted elsewhere in Europe. To accuse her of ""licensing greed"" is mere name-calling. She was an exceptionally cautious deregulator. She opposed Lord Howe's decision in 1979 to cut income tax from 83% to 60%. She was soft on welfare fraud, indulgent of housing benefit, lavish on health spending and custodian of a public sector that rose in her first parliament from 41% to 44% of gross domestic product.  Meanwhile history is silent on the downside of the Thatcher era. The command structure she created to crush her foes became unrestrained, over-centralised and inefficient. Her evisceration of local democracy bred a cynicism among Britons towards political participation that remains unique in Europe. It also led to her downfall through the poll tax.  Thatcher was one of the great ""nationalisers"" of all time, taking control of the public housing stock, the rating system, a previously devolved hospital service, the universities, the courts, crown prosecution and, during the miners' strike, the police. It was Thatcher who turned Whitehall from an elite administrative corps into a demoralised, politicised officialdom which, under Blair and Brown, became besotted with targets, initiatives and useless IT systems. Thatcher removed former nationalised industries from the state. But ask any doctor, farmer, lecturer, engineer or victim of the health and safety executive if, as a result of Thatcher, they feel less or more liberated from state interference. You will get a sick laugh.  The portrayal of Thatcher as libertarian St Joan in the fight against big government is nonsense. When I once suggested to her that a policy she was proposing was hardly laissez-faire, she exploded: ""Never accuse me of that ghastly French word. I believe government should be strong in what it does.""  All politicians are creatures of paradox. The electorate expects it of them as part of the democratic compromise. The paradox of Thatcher is that she is blamed for her strengths and excused her weaknesses. She was not the person of current mythology.  • Simon Jenkins is the author of Thatcher and Sons simon.jenkins@theguardian.com",Simon Jenkins: This Thatcher mythology condemns her strengths and excuses her failings,2009-03-13T00:01:00Z,Simon Jenkins,politics
"If ever the world would have forgiven a man for not being able to walk and chew gum at the same time, it would have been now. No one would blame Barack Obama if he focused exclusively on the economic crisis, pushing the foreign policy in-tray to the back of his desk. After all, there's only so much even a Messiah can handle. But last September, when a panicked John McCain suspended his campaign to return to Washington and deal with the financial turmoil, Obama refused to follow, explaining that ""Presidents are going to have to deal with more than one thing at a time"". In that spirit, he has advanced a programme of Rooseveltian ambition at home - while not forgetting that his job description also demands he be the lead actor abroad. It's not been easy: there are reports of flashes of irritation, as well as streaks of grey on the presidential head. By all accounts the president often looks like he needs a cigarette. Badly. For all that, he has crammed a slew of foreign policy moves into his first six weeks, any one of which would have made big news in normal times. Instead, in the age of global economic meltdown, they have had to fight for more than fleeting media attention. Most visible have been the big declarations, whether announcing the beginning of the end of the Iraq war, avowing that the United States of America ""does not torture"", or ordering that Guantánamo be closed. In just the last week, we've had secretary of state Hillary Clinton dispatching officials to Syria as well as inviting Iran to talks on the future of Afghanistan - extending a hand to two states previously consigned to outer darkness. The start of the month brought the revelation that Obama had written a secret letter to his Russian counterpart, Dmitri Medvedev, hinting at a deal in which Moscow would lean on Iran, urging it to abandon its quest for nuclear weapons, in return for the US scrapping its planned installation of a missile defence system in Russia's eastern European backyard. A gesture to cap it all: the Obama administration has moved to ease trade and travel restrictions with Cuba. So there's no shortage of activity. The question - 50 days into the administration - is: what does it all amount to? Is there a common thread of logic running through these moves, one that we might describe, however prematurely, as the Obama doctrine? The first unifying theme, sounded minutes after he took the presidential oath, is a repudiation of the legacy of his predecessor. Obama is determined to signal to the world that he is the unBush. Some on both the left and right have suggested that this is more symbolic than real, that in fact the basic lineaments of US policy remain in place. Obama will keep rather a lot of troops in Iraq until the end of 2011, just as the Bush administration planned to; he has intensified US involvement in Afghanistan, sending 17,000 more troops; and Robert Gates, George Bush's defence secretary, remains in post under Obama. Put that to the Obama team, and they don't wholly deny it. The US did not become a different country on 20 January, they say; its interests have not changed overnight. It's true, they concede, that in its second term the Bush White House did become more ""realist"", opening up lines of communication with the likes of Iran. The difference, says the new team in Washington, is that while the Bush folk were ""forced"" into realism after seeing their ideological dreams in ruins, ""this is our starting point"". What no one denies is that there is a clear advantage for the US in the rest of the world believing that a profound change has come about. Which is why Joe Biden's declaration that the US is pressing the ""reset button"" has become the current catchphrase of US diplomacy. A benign assessment of the Obama record so far would see two other early traits. The first is a readiness to speak the truth. Asked by the New York Times last week if the US was winning the war in Afghanistan, he replied tersely: ""No."" After the Bush years, when those who followed the evidence were dismissed as dullards imprisoned in the narrow-minded confines of the ""reality-based community"", such candour is a relief. Second, there are some signs of imaginative thinking. Deploying the veteran of the Northern Ireland peace process, George Mitchell, to the Israel-Palestine conflict is one of those ideas that seems obvious - but only because it makes so much sense. The same goes for allocating the Afghan-Pakistan, or ""Afpak"", file to hardball maestro Richard Holbrooke. But plaudits surely go to Obama's direct appeal to Medvedev, with its echoes of John F Kennedy's resolution of the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. Just as JFK agreed to remove US missiles from Turkey if the Soviet Union took theirs away from Cuba, so Obama implicitly made a similar offer to Russia: you get Iran to back down, and I'll remove my interceptor missiles and radar stations from Poland and the Czech Republic. If such an initiative were to work, the knock-on effects would be multiple. Take one: Israel has long hinted that if its friends were to make the Iranian threat go away, it would respond by moving forward on the peace track. For a long while that was assumed to mean military action against Iran. But if Obama's Russia gambit were to succeed - and the critics claim Gates started work on these lines a year ago - the goal of an Iranian nuclear freeze, with all its ancillary benefits, would be achieved without a shot being fired. And this surely is the current Obama doctrine: the emphasis on what candidate Obama, nearly two years ago, called ""tough-minded diplomacy"". To be clear, this is not guitar-strumming hippy dovishness, as the escalation in Afghanistan confirms - though one senior administration official warns against overinterpreting that move. It is a ""time-buying exercise"", he says, ensuring things don't get worse on the ground while the White House undertakes a strategic review of the entire Afpak region, from where, it argues, every major al-Qaida attack since 9/11 has emanated. That same official explained it to me like this yesterday: ""The Bush administration hindered its own efforts by tying one hand behind its back. Diplomacy is a tool, but they viewed it with such suspicion, as if those who pursued it were somehow weak. This is about being wise."" In this conception, almost no one is off limits. Obama spoke last week of reaching out to those moderate elements of the Taliban that can be reached, much as dialogue with assorted Sunni militias eventually brought progress in Iraq. But while it is the prospect of dialogue with America's enemies that generates headlines, no less important is the relationship with America's friends. Pressed to define the doctrine of the administration he serves, that senior official says it's the ""recognition of the necessity and efficacy of collective action"". I'm told that this was the thrust of Biden's message to Nato's North Atlantic Council in Brussels yesterday: not some kind of ""wussy multilateralism"", with lots of cosy meetings and platitudes, but a ""results-oriented"" desire to get things done - and the belief that that only happens when the world acts in concert. To be sure, these are only the early signals in the early days. But from a president with his hands full, they are encouraging. freedland@theguardian.com","Jonathan Freedland: After a flurry of early activity, the Obama doctrine is taking shape",2009-03-11T00:01:00Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"There was the first sign last week that the cumulative impact of the government's policy may eventually turn round the recession. That doesn't mean there aren't potential disasters ahead. Barclays will probably follow Lloyds and RBS into majority public ownership, there is a possible bail-out of a big insurance company, another 15% fall in house prices, a period of disinflation and at least a one and a half million rise in unemployment. This will still feel like the catastrophe that it is. Nothing exemplifies this more than yesterday's news that Lloyds Group has followed RBS in the realms of zombie status. The taxpayer now has to guarantee a quarter of all UK lending, which represents the end of the British financial system as we know it. We are living through terrible times - and the risk of a global depression is very real. But economies have a lot of upward momentum built in. Goods wear out and need to be replaced. Houses that will have fallen 40% in value over two years will start to look cheap. Shops and businesses will have to re-order goods from factories as stocks run out. Cheap money and cheap petrol will boost our real incomes. Oil at $40 a barrel will be a trillion-dollar stimulus to the Western economies in 2009. Global economies have always responded in the past. They will again. After all, recessions don't go on for ever. This one is already nine months long: another 12 months of continually falling output, which is highly likely, would make it the longest since the early 1930s. What is needed is some trigger to make people think that, after all, the world will not end. There has been the biggest devaluation in modern times, virtually free money and a huge fiscal deficit. All are stimulatory. What we have needed is more measures to put a floor under the economy next year; for if confidence can return, the upward movement may be quite sudden. Last week we got one such measure. The Bank of England's announcement that it will buy £75bn of government securities over the next three months out of its own reserves, then spend another £75bn in the same way on a combination of government securities and commercial paper, was in many respects more important than the autumn's £15bn VAT cut. This is ""quantitative easing"": doling out Bank of England cash in vast quantities at negligible interest rates to boost lending and spending on an epic scale.  Critics have been quick to say it is no more than printing money, putting the Brown government in the same camp as Zimbabwe, Weimar Germany or Henry VIII - a monarch who repeatedly recalled coins to be reminted with less gold and silver so that he could sustain wanton spending. Lib Dem shadow chancellor Vincent Cable has warned it is a return to boom and bust, and that the move presages inflation. He is not alone. But I suspect Cable's gloom has got the better of him. This year Britain's nominal GDP - the value of the combined contribution of output and inflation - will actually drop by some 3-4%. Money held by households and firms is contracting - a harbinger of disinflation and slump. The Bank of England correctly says instead that it wants nominal GDP to rise by 5% as soon as possible, and that cannot happen while critical stocks of cash are falling. So it is going to resort to the printing presses - or a click on its computer screen - to reverse the trend. Would we rather the Bank accommodated declining GDP? Or try to stimulate it?  Although everybody is rushing to say how unusual the approach is, in fact it is only a variant of the way Britain used to run the financial system until it fell into the hands of the market fundamentalists. We used to siphon quantities of cash out of bank balance sheets in booms, making them sterilised reserves at the Bank of England; and in downturns release the cash back. It is still how most banking systems in Asia are run, and when the European Central Bank was established- to derision in London - it retained the facility.  However, these reserve requirements were abolished by Margaret Thatcher in 1980 as a keystone in her free market revolution, so that by the late 1980s every control and regulation on City lending had been scrapped. Bankers said they represented an unacceptable tax on banking: a number of us warned that without such controls, especially reserve requirements, there would be another runaway credit boom to follow that of the late 1980s - only much worse. Without better regulations on banking, which enjoyed so many other privileges, the inevitable bust would follow the boom. Re-reading now what I wrote in a 1990s report called ""Good Housekeeping: how to manage credit and debt"", makes me both heavy-hearted (so much was avoidable) and furious (conceding the bankers' case has imposed misery on millions). But there is a conclusion for today. If we are lucky enough for prices to stop falling soon, and inflation to reappear as a genuine prospect - spelling as it will hope of recovery - the Bank of England can act as it once did before Thatcher. It can siphon inflationary cash out of the system by requiring the commercial banks to lodge deposits at the Bank - quantitative tightening. Indeed, the chancellor should institutionalise the approach and re-establish a permanent reserve requirement regime. Yet to get to such a hopeful point, the cash injected into the system in the months ahead has to be lent, spent and not hoarded. Here the government has to make three more major moves. It has to create some ""good"" banks fast which will close the gap left by the flight of foreign banks; it should create a National Infrastructure Bank, a Housing Bank and Knowledge Bank, all of which can raise cheap finance by Bank of England purchases of their debt. Then it has to create some demand for loans.  In the budget, the chancellor should announce two measures to encourage borrowing and spending. There should be income contingent mortgages, so that repayments automatically adjust to borrowers' fluctuating incomes and home equity can be insured. And he should also announce a job guarantee for every unemployed individual out of work for more than a year.  In other words, come what may, there will be work and you will be able to service your mortgage. Do all this and the economy will stabilise next year. But what a price we have all paid for bankers' freedoms.",Will Hutton: Printing money is the right way to get us out of this mess,2009-03-08T00:01:00Z,Will Hutton,politics
"How mortifying for Sir Fred Goodwin to discover that the American senator, Ted Kennedy, will soon be as titled as he is. Sir Allen Stanford, must feel the same. Indeed, now that the historian Andrew Roberts has identified the award to Kennedy as ""an obscenity"" not only knights, but companions, dames and OBEs up and down the honours system will be wondering what can be done to prevent the celebrated survivor of Chappaquiddick from bringing this cherished hierarchy into disrepute.  Couldn't they make him a lord, instead? Everyone knows that, far from demanding unrealistic standards of probity, the upper house is a beacon of offender rehabilitation that brings comfort to the darkest prison cell. Already there are hopes in psychiatric circles that, once he is released for good behaviour, the Yorkshire Ripper might become the first reformed serial killer to ornament the crossbenches.  Tags permitting, it should not be long before members of the Lords, including former convict Lord Archer, welcome the return of Lord Black, following his stay in Florida's Coleman Federal Correctional Institution, and of fellow prodigal Lord Ahmed, whom we hope is settling nicely into his new sentence for dangerous driving. In an enlightened jail there seems no reason why Lord Ahmed should have to interrupt his mission to keep dangerous undesirables such as Geert Wilders from entering this country.  But knighthoods are different. Perhaps because of their faintly bourgeois, civil service connotations, these honours are supposed, unlike the presents that are peerages, to reward consistently high standards of civic behaviour. The late Anthony Blunt was never charged or convicted of a crime, unlike Lords Archer, Black and Ahmed, but his spying apparently fell short of the requirement that a knight's achievements be ""inspirational and significant nationally"". Thus, even though Blunt's services to the Soviet Union over a working lifetime certainly satisfied another official criterion (that of ""sustained commitment""), his knighthood was removed in 1979.  Now, to clarify things, government guidance on honours explains that ""the sovereign may, on the advice of ministers, cancel an award if the holder is considered unworthy to retain it. The object of forfeiture is to preserve the integrity of the honours system."" This laudable concern for integrity can only add to the value of a brand new knighthood. There would be little for Sir Ted Kennedy to celebrate or, indeed, anything for career civil servants or professional athletes to aspire to, if their titles had to be shared with, say, financial idiots whose greed and recklessness constitute a mass mugging of their fellow citizens. For his part, Sir Fred Goodwin, though now despised and reviled even by people who have never seen the picture of him posing with a 12-bore, must find his knighthood more precious, even, than his pension. It is proof that, only five years ago, both Gordon Brown and the Queen endorsed the view of his chairman, fellow knight Sir George Mathewson of the RBS group, that ""the honour is richly deserved"". Considering that the knighthood turns out, on the contrary, to have been one of the least deserved since Mordred got one off King Arthur, it is peculiar that calls for its return should have been so subdued, when compared with demands for the commandeering of his pension. It is clear that the ad hoc removal of Goodwin's pension would be a concession to public feeling that set an outrageous precedent. Equally, it is obvious that Fred's title makes a nonsense of an honours system which actually has a perfectly good procedure allowing for the removal of a title if ""the holder is considered unworthy to retain it"". How many more banks does he need to destroy?  And from the mob perspective, isn't de-titling a much more appealing punishment? Not the least excruciating aspect of the financial catastrophe is the absolute impossibility of penalising its authors as they exit, in contrast to their employees and victims, with fortunes, motors, bling, homes, wives, honours, retirements and tight little smiles all intact. Even if Fred were to lose a fraction of his fortune in some sort of mad Harriet-raid, he would have years left in which to consult it back up again. But titles are irreplaceable treasures, always dearer to the mediocre than to the distinguished, and you would resent its loss terribly, wouldn't you, Fred?  Sure, you could buy a used one off ""Lord"" Hugh Rodley, who won't need his phoney gong since being jailed last week for an attempted bank raid, but would it be recognised outside Tewkesbury? The major disadvantage to knighthood-stripping as a form of banker-punishment is its admission of faults in the honours system. If it happens at all, it will not happen while the infallible Gordon Brown remains at large. There is also the problem that even as Gordon dished honours out like 10 men, some of the city's leading gits and speculators went unrewarded. But social opprobrium does not stand on ceremony: from Sir Fred to plain Andy and Adam, all are, in the public's impartial, unfashionably unforgiving eye, equally deserving of disgrace.  How best to express it? In a fascinating paper, in which he explores the public response to Victorian speculators who brought down the Royal British Bank in 1856, the historian, James Taylor, shows how ridicule, satire and their caricature in contemporary novels, proved more effective than legal punishments in humiliating those responsible and destroying their reputations. Even if our own government were not so reluctant to pursue charges of negligence against bankers where unimaginable sums have unaccountably been lost, the most effective retribution might still be in the hands of the public. Perhaps the best solution yet for alleviating popular resentment comes from Fred himself. It was reported last week, that he is thinking of moving abroad. May I suggest that he does not do so until the public has formally decided that he is the person it most wants to see in exile? Although some people object that ""personalised"" verbal attacks on Fred and similar recipients of personal honours are low and barbaric, an orderly, physically harmless form of individual ostracism was one of the glories of Greek civilisation.  Every year, at around this time, Athenians would be invited to hold an ostracism, whereby voters would write on a shard of pottery the name of the person they would like to be chucked out of the city-state. The most unwanted individual would be given 10 days to prepare for 10 years of exile. His fortune, nervous speculators should note, would remain intact. I am no lawyer, but the introduction of a similar system here would seem less challenging to the rule of law than anything currently proposed by Harriet Harman. And for Fred, the perverse ostracism of Hyperbolos in 417BC is a sign not do anything too hasty. Unless, while we're getting the pots and urns ready, he felt like giving up his title, awarded for services to banking.","Catherine Bennett: Want to hurt Sir Fred?

"British politics – or rather, the bit of it situated on the centre-left – has been a state of ongoing tumult since the Iraq war, but it now feels more uneasy and conflicted than ever. To take this down to brass tacks, try this: I want Labour to win the next election, but as things stand, the prospect fills me with dread. Even if the politics of One More Heave could see them miraculously stagger over the finishing line, what kind of government would we be in for? In the absence of a clear understanding of both a failed economic model and an increasingly broken politics, it would be fated to disaster. Another government elected on a minority of the vote, sticking to a centralised, authoritarian politics, believing that globalisation has to be accommodated rather than shaped, trying once again to convince us that we can somehow splice together turbocharged capitalism and social justice … that mess of illusions and vanities is surely now finished. I've co-written a piece in this week's New Statesman – with Neal Lawson, the chair of Compass – that aims to get to grips with some of this. Our starting point is this: that despite the self-evident demise of the 30-year Thatcher-Reagan settlement, the people at the top of both main parties are united by a shared sense that if their particular policies come to pass, we'll eventually get back to ""normal"". To be fair to Labour, there are odd flashes of something new – witness Gordon Brown's words about tax havens and shadow banks in yesterday's speech to Congress – and the odd, mildly diverting shift in their rhetoric, as evidenced by Peter Mandelson's words last night about a quest to somehow nudge business towards ""public responsibility"". But set against the bigger picture, they threaten to fade into insignificance.  This remains, needless to say, a government run by people who want to part-privatise Royal Mail, expand Heathrow airport, and use the recession to torch the proposals (for improved flexible working, and moves on the gender pay gap) that arguably represent the last of Labour's progressive credentials. Behind each of those lies the same depressing syndrome: craven genuflection to business – even now! - and little or no wish to capitalise on changed times. Extend that analysis to high finance, and a depressing picture threatens to turn truly miserable. There is currently no end of conversation about, say, clearly separating retail and investment banking and remutualising your Northern Rocks and Bradford and Bingleys, but who at the top is listening? It's strange to think that on the first point at least, George Osborne has been making more convincing arguments – though of course, as with the government, the bigger Tory context means such positioning represents very thin gruel indeed. So what to do? This is no time for anything other than urgency and creative thinking. Politics is peeling away from real life, and leaving a vacuum that is already being filled by very ugly forces: the recession, lest we forget, is proving to be a boon for the BNP, as June's European elections may yet illustrate. At this rate, as per usual, the next general election will be fought over such a trifling patch of political ground that the disconnection from politics that has been building since 1997 will surely turn dysfunctional.  Put simply, the centre of politics needs shifting – and what heightens the sense of frustration with Westminster is the fact that all kinds of groups and individuals increasingly share a basic understanding not just of what's gone wrong, but what needs to be put right. Large swaths of the Labour party and the Liberal Democrats, the Green party, and the progressive bits of Plaid Cymru and the SNP understand how broken-down politics is becoming, and the crucial issues that Westminster isn't going near (even the odd Tory is on roughly the same page). The same applies to the more clued-up trade unions. Some lefties may be unsettled to hear it, but within the church, plenty of high-up voices are making the right noises – as, of course, are scores of campaign groups and NGOs. This isn't to suggest such a massively diverse range of people would even begin to agree on the stuff of hard policy, but rather to recognise that they have a shared interest in the same basic change: a decisive end to market fundamentalism, and a politics that can start to meaningfully deal with equality, environmental sustainability, and the broken-down state of our democracy. Thinking about it, there's at least one policy on which you'd expect instant agreement: the long-overdue introduction of proportional representation for Westminster elections, from which a good deal of seismic change would follow (by way of getting some argument going, the New Statesman piece comes with 10 suggested policies that would kick things in a new direction, from a land tax to a living wage).  As our article says, all those people need to start talking – about their shared interest in pushing politics into the present (let alone the future), and making it meaningful again. We're not talking about any kind of electoral alliance or lasting pact: both during and after the process of joining forces to shift the terms of debate, divisions would remain and politics would go on. When it comes to what form all this might take, there are past precedents: the Scottish Constitutional Convention that delivered devolution in the teeth of Tony Blair's opposition, past campaigns such as Charter 88 – and, more recently, the Convention on Modern Liberty (if only as another example, it might also be worth thinking about, dare I say it, the Countryside Alliance). As with everything else, if the right coming-together started to happen, exactly how to make the right interventions would be among the first things discussed (though, to tackle one point by paraphrasing the Billy Bragg song, getting 50 celebrities to sign a petition is not enough, in days like these). The conversation would doubtless be messy, and difficult, and prone to spin out of control. But as one of the politicians who got us in this mess used to say, there is surely no alternative.",John Harris: Let's push politics into the present,2009-03-05T15:30:00Z,John Harris,politics
"What larks! What knockabout! What symbolism! With Gordon Brown presumably destroying his fingernails as he finishes his imminent speech to both houses of Congress, the ubiquitous Harriet Harman took prime minister's questions today: a nervy gig, what with the poison allegedly being thrown her way from both elements within Downing Street, and her opponents within cabinet (for a flavour, try this and this). Before we get started, a quick point: contrary to the idea that HH's apparent manoeuvring makes her a uniquely ambitious and treacherous presence in cabinet, there is a good deal of mischievous game-playing going on, involving quite a few people: witness fascinating high-up leaks about Brown's supposed inability to understand the economic nitty-gritty, yesterday's borderline absurd stories about James Purnell, and a lot of under-reported jockeying by good old Hazel Blears. Anyway, that other leadership hopeful, David Miliband, sat to Harman's right, while the pantomimic virtuoso William Hague stood in for Cameron, and got to work. The latter is, of course, a parliamentary natural, and out it all came: the delayed and uncertain schemes whose ever-expanding number threatens to sum up the government's panicked approach to the economic crisis, and – after only a few minutes – where exactly Harman's recent kite-flying sits in relation to her alleged ambitions. In its own slightly misogynistic way, Hague's choicest line was a killer: ""When Chamberlain lost his party's confidence, Churchill came forward; Supermac stepped in when Eden failed … this could be her moment."" Arf, arf.  Her best attack was the kind that Brown has long been reluctant to launch, focusing on the fact that the gospel of deregulation and uncontrolled finance was a Conservative invention, praised to the skies by Prince Billy when he had his brief go at the leadership. She read him one of his quotes from circa 2001: ""As PM, I will make deregulation one of my top priorities. I will drive deregulation from the centre. I will promote ministers … on the basis of how much they deregulate."" Such are the roots of the Tories' essential problem right now, though as Hague shot back, Brown and his ministers are in almost the same place. Who, he asked the house, recently renamed the Department of Trade and Industry the Department of Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform? While we're here, it's also worth quoting from a 2005 Brown speech to the CBI that arrived in my inbox yesterday:  The better, and in my opinion the correct, modern model of regulation – the risk based approach – is based on trust in the responsible company, the engaged employee and the educated consumer, leading government to focus its attention where it should: no inspection without justification, no form filling without justification, and no information requirements without justification, not just a light touch but a limited touch … The new model of regulation can be applied … to the regulation of financial services and indeed to the administration of tax. And more than that, we should not only apply the concept of risk to the enforcement of regulation, but also to the design and indeed to the decision as to whether to regulate at all.  Really, it makes you weep. Now, come Brown's increasingly inevitable demise, Labour will surely need a leader with the kind of sharpened, social-democratic take on neoliberalism – not to mention a market-worshipping Cameron government – that the New Labour straitjacket still rules out. When Harman dutifully dished out the government line on the part-privatisation of Royal Mail – which she's known to oppose – you were once again reminded of what a confused state they're in, and how contorted it makes most ministers look. Even behind the scenes, one hears precious little that might form the basis of a convincing leadership campaign next year. But despite Harman's compromised position, could it be her? If only to get you going, I'll try this: as proved by bits of HH's pretty creditable performance today and recent noises about her arguments within cabinet, she could yet develop her left-of-Brown position into something halfway convincing and admirably timely. If she got over her habit of taking her more radical suggestions back, a lot of people might be more supportive than you'd think. She's 10-3 favourite at the bookies, apparently. If you can see past the current vicious attacks on her, you might be able to see why.

"Given what we now know about the human brain, it is clear that prolonged exposure to an unnatural environment like the House of Lords must have a damaging effect. If the ageing brain is artificially denied stimulation over a long period, it might lead to a condition almost indistinguishable from idiocy. The effects on communication have been documented for years. Now some leading neuro-scientists are suggesting that flashing lights and bells be fitted to go off regularly in the chamber, in order to induce in members something resembling an average attention span. Certainly, until something is done, we are unlikely to see an end to embarrassments such as last week's inconclusive debate on social network regulation. It had barely begun when leading neuroscientist and ""people's peer"" Baroness Susan Greenfield abruptly abandoned the official subject in order to prophesy, instead, the sensationalism, infantilism, autism, callousness and myriad other brain catastrophes now in store for the Facebook-using generation. ""It is hard,"" warned the baroness, whose own mental agility developed during that golden age for humans, roughly between our leaving the savannah and setting up the internet, ""to see how living in this way on a daily basis will not result in brains or, rather, minds different from those of previous generations."" Attention spans, she warned, would be one of the first things to go. Was it any coincidence that the ""near total submersion of our culture in screen technologies"" has coincided with escalating prescriptions for ADHD?  It was another unproved, but, at this stage, equally unverifiable Greenfield hunch that too much time in front of a screen might instil in blighted minds a ""much more marked preference for the here and now, where the immediacy of the experience trumps any regard for the consequences"". The baroness, having been increasingly obliged to issue her warnings without any academic evidence, must be only too aware of the hazards. But speak she must. Because an unnamed teacher has told the baroness that this same Facebook generation is also bereft of empathy, owing to not reading enough books. But is it any coincidence, some neuroscientists must be wondering, that this hardening has occurred over exactly the same period that pitiless Lord Voldemort, of the Harry Potter books, has had the opportunity to alter the brain chemistry of millions of young readers? Drawing on the very latest developments in social networking and on something she read by a psychotherapist, Greenfield prefers to implicate sites that encourage users to define themselves by responses of others. ""Hence,"" she said, ""the baffling current preoccupation with posting an almost moment-by-moment, flood-of-consciousness account - I believe it is called Twitter - of your thoughts and activities, however banal."" Over on Twitter, the response to this criticism seems to have been muted, partly because, as Greenfield will be aware, a medium that constantly asks the question ""What are you doing?"" is not perfectly designed for discussion. But if anything, Twitterers probably enjoyed it. There are few things earlyish adopters of a new device for social networking like better than to witness the power of their chosen medium to mystify, dismay and for as long as possible exclude less adventurous consumers. One explanation for the migration to Twitter, surely, is the arrival of grandparents on Facebook, recently followed by John Prescott's advertisement of 25 things we didn't know about him. Indeed, it will be interesting to see how quickly he can destroy the allure of Twitter. Though even the oldest among us can see that Facebook represents a marvellous saving on stamps, Twitter emphasises its desirability by being unfathomable to anyone a bit inflexible or busy who is neither a self-promoter nor an exhibitionist. Why would you want to answer the question ""What are you doing?"" in up to 140 characters? If such questions only betray one's dizzying proximity to the grave, there is also much on Twitter to comfort the mature visitor. The abundance of tweets, even from more dashing contributors, saying things like ""about to have breakfast"", ""too tired"", or ""Masterchef final was very good"" confirms that age has finally surrendered its monopoly on unembarrassed inanity. Indeed, when the first genuinely interesting tweet is posted, as in ""looking down at my grey, motionless body"", or the simpler ""dying"", it is likely to come from an older subscriber.  A much more surprising thing about Twitter, if you can be bothered to look, is the degree of self-consciousness among participants about the nature of their new hobby. Long before Baroness Greenfield and her fellow critics decided that Twitter's function is to remind members of an insecure generation that they exist, its victims had agreed that one of its main purposes was to make them feel close to celebrities such as Stephen Fry, who is generous with his travel impressions. For instance: ""What a beautiful town."" The comedian has also dazzled followers with his use of the word steatopygous (from the Greek for fat-arsed). ""I absolutely love it when you send me running for my dictionary,"" tweets one, gratefully. Is it possible that, quite understandably, and like many older people, Baroness Greenfield merely finds this new craze silly and irritating? And then reacts, rather as parents once did to pop music and short skirts, by insisting that Twittering must be injurious to health? In a new way that is so utterly sinister, you won't see the result for years. Search as she might, this scientist is going to have difficulty proving that swapping twerpish thoughts on breakfast is harmful to the brain. And what, moreover, would Twitter's critics prefer fans of Stephen Fry to do instead? Oliver James thinks no one would twitter ""if they had a strong sense of identity"". Let us picture them, instead, studying Coleen Rooney's steatopygous style tips in OK! magazine. Or browsing through a wholesome misery memoir, or meditating privately on Jade, or shopping in Primark. They may, however, want to think twice before investing £88 in a MindFit, as endorsed by Baroness Greenfield. Not now that research confirms that this, and similar ""brain training"" systems are no more likely to improve your brain than, say, telling people on Twitter that you feel tired.  Obviously a leisure dedicated entirely to Twitter, Facebook or any other on-screen activity is likely to strike most educated people as a sad waste. But a lot of these people will themselves be enjoying some sort of online social life or even, as Age Concern confirms with its IT events, come to rely on this alternative to complete isolation.  The Lords are right to want to protect vulnerable users from exploitation and from the inadvertent creation of an indelible archive of social networking follies. What a pity that their discussion of regulation should have been hijacked last week by Greenfield's latest, astonishingly unscientific outburst. Why does she do it? In no more than 140 characters, I would say it has something to do with needing recognition in order to confirm that she exists. Still: she could always use a pseudonym.

"On Tuesday night, 100 billionaires will gather at London's sumptuous Dorchester hotel, to watch Mr Ted Turner in conversation with Ms Carol Vorderman. Ms Joss Stone will sing, and some model or other will be in attendance. Can you guess the aim of this evening, which I trust you would cross continents to avoid in the infinitely unlikely event that you had been invited? No? Then allow me to assist. The aim is to make the government give tax breaks to the super-rich, in order to tempt them to give the same percentage of income to charity as the poorest 20% of people in this country already do. Feel free to be taken unwell.  Initially I assumed the Fortune Forum, for so it is named, was an elaborate living satire, designed to highlight practically everything that is wrong with contemporary life. Alas, The Fortune Forum is all too real. It was dreamt up by an heiress called Renu Mehta, as a kind of vaguely benevolent mini-Davos. It is now in its third year, and has made several donations to the world's neediest people, including paying one Bill Clinton a rumoured $450,000 to address it. But it is the Fortune Forum's latest scheme that really impresses. As the Guardian reported yesterday, Mehta enlisted the Nobel prize winning economist Sir James Mirrlees to come up with a plan to address the shaming statistic that Britain's richest 20% donate 0.8% of their income to charity, while the poorest 20% give 3%. He duly concocted a tax proposal. To wit: 50% of money donated towards the UN's millennium development goals through this scheme would be deducted from an individual or corporation's tax liability (which is of course only 40% or 28% respectively), with the government making up the other 50% from its aid budget. Naturally, the super-rich donors would get to decide on what projects their money was spent. Let's see that in action, shall we? The UK's total overseas aid budget was £4.9bn in 2007-2008. Mehta suggests her scheme could persuade the super-rich to part with an extra £5bn a year, but of course the government is required to backmatch that notional sum, meaning that the entire aid budget would be swallowed up. What this means, effectively, is that control over the UK's aid budget would pass from the Department for International Development to a bunch of private individuals.  As the tax campaigner Richard Murphy points out, this is fundamentally undemocratic. Depressingly, Mirrlees and Mehta have already been granted two meetings with the Treasury, at which they insisted the scheme should be extended to those whose tax affairs are offshore, in effect allowing the use of UK taxpayers' money to be directed by tax exiles - and giving them tax relief for the privilege. Did you ever hear anything so defeatist? Rather than make a concerted attempt to close down these offshore havens, the Treasury is now considering further enabling them with a cashback scheme because they are too tight to give the same percentage of their wealth to charity as someone in the lowest income bracket. Allowing this would be a monumental scandal. One suspects Mirrlees is a Nobel economics laureate much in the same way that Henry Kissinger is a Nobel peace laureate. Another of his brainwaves is replacing corporation tax with a higher rate of VAT, a move which would shift the tax burden from the rich to the poor. Yet he will inevitably be lauded for this latest plan by those puffed-up fauxlanthropists who monopolise the aid debate.  And so to our old friend Bono, who this week announced he is displeased at being called a hypocrite for moving his tax affairs to the Netherlands, all the while lobbying the Irish government to increase its aid budget. As you may recall, the Tax Justice Network estimates that if tax was paid on the money the world's rich have protected in tax havens, it would raise enough to finance those millennium development goals five times over. ""I can understand how people outside the country wouldn't understand how Ireland got to its prosperity,"" Bono bleated to the Irish Times in the course of promoting his new album, ""but everybody in Ireland knows that there are some very clever people in the government and in the revenue who created a financial architecture that prospered the entire nation - it was a way of attracting people to this country who wouldn't normally do business here. And the financial services brought billions of dollars every year directly to the exchequer. What's actually hypocritical is the idea that then you couldn't use a financial services centre in Holland."" Now that Ireland's economy has gone belly up, you mean? He's not the brightest, is he? At least he's only parlayed himself into the role of Africa's messiah.  For Mehta's part, she keeps waffling that ""we have to achieve philanthropic parity"". As I wrote here last week, philanthropy begins with paying tax, and given the super-rich's notorious capacity for weaselling out of it, the very last thing we should be slinging their way are further tax breaks, let alone control of aid budgets. marina.hyde@theguardian.com",Marina Hyde: Give to the rich to help the poor?

"Barack Obama's speech at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina may not mark the end of the war in Iraq – it is, rather, the beginning of the end – but it certainly marks a milestone in a personal odyssey that took an unknown young politician from obscurity all the way to the White House. For it was the war in Iraq which propelled Obama's candidacy for the presidency. In October 2002 he made a speech that, in some ways, remains the most important of his career. Then a mere member of the Illinois state Senate, he joined a peace rally in Chicago and declared his opposition to ""A dumb war. A rash war."" That stance helped him in his 2004 bid for the US Senate, but it mattered much more at the start of 2007, when he launched his improbable campaign for the presidency. The advantage Obama had over all his main competitors for the Democratic nomination – and especially frontrunner Hillary Clinton – was that he had opposed the invasion of Iraq while they had supported it. Indeed, he could point to the very week he had taken his stance in Chicago as the moment Clinton and the others cast their Senate votes to give George Bush the authority to wage war against Saddam Hussein. As the war became ever more unpopular, especially among Democrats, that left Obama perfectly placed as the anti-war candidate. He could boast of his superior position, while Clinton was pressured to admit she had been wrong. Later, in the general election contest against John McCain, Obama could neutralise McCain's claims of greater experience by insisting that what mattered more was judgement – and that Obama had proven his was superior. So it is no exaggeration to say that President Obama would not be where he is today had it not been for the Iraq war and his stance on it. All of which lent an extra charge to the announcement he made on Friday. He was able to unveil a plan for ""how the war in Iraq will end"" without ambivalence, needing no contorted formulations to explain why he had changed his position – and no pretence that a clear-cut victory had been won – as would have been required by either a President McCain or President Hillary Clinton. He could be straightforward: This was a war he would never have started, and now he was going to end it. To make that declaration before men and women in uniform was a masterstroke, signalling that he had only respect for those Americans who had fought the war – and heading off any suggestions, often hurled at Democrats, that he was insufficiently supportive of the military. There was no shock in the speech. A combat troop withdrawal date a couple of months beyond the 16-month timetable he had promised in the 2008 campaign had been widely expected. Nor is it a surprise that all US troops will aim to be gone from Iraq by the end of 2011. That much was implied in the Status of Forces Agreement concluded with the Iraqi government. But to hear it directly from the mouth of a sitting US president, rather than low-level officials, and without heavy caveats, gives it enormous power. It means Barack Obama is determined to go into the 2012 election campaign as the man who did what he promised, ending an unpopular war. And it marks yet another step in Obama's steady repudiation of his predecessor. In little more than a month, he has ordered the closure of Guantánamo, and on Tuesday he declared: ""The United States does not torture."" On Friday he drew one more line under the Bush era, seeking to conclude its most neuralgic episode.",Jonathan Freedland: Obama's early opposition to the Iraq war gives him extra authority now to call for its end,2009-02-27T19:26:05Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"Among the big questions circulating about the 21st-century film industry are these: why are women in mainstream films so vapid? Why are big names so crucial in securing backing, when they don't secure much in terms of consistency or quality? And why do the politics of mainstream narratives seem so dim witted? Changing cinematic presentations of women have been very well documented - we seem, as a gender, to have been getting stupider since about the mid-90s. In the real world is the idea that women should be able to seek gainful employment and be fairly treated in that pursuit; yet on the big screen you have heroines such as the ""journalist"" in Confessions of a Shopaholic, the ""lawyer"" in Legally Blonde(s), the ""lawyer"" (again) in Sex and the City (the movie) - all putatively demanding careers, undertaken by people so thick they can't understand basic words.  The big-star cast argument is well illustrated by the Oscars. It was with some puff and pride that news services announced on Monday that Slumdog Millionaire was the first film with wholly British backing to win since 1947. According to rumour at least, it attracted no international interest, having no big names in the cast.  Gran Torino is a more concrete example of this on the flip side - it's a by-numbers, horrid-racist-finds-enlightenment-through-engagement cliche. The only conceivable reason for its existence is the star power of Clint Eastwood. In fairness it's his credibility, that he's spent nearly 80 years forging - if he wants to toast it and feed it to a dog, that's his business. This tessellates with the political point: certain credos of identity politics are very popular with mainstream cinema; you shouldn't be racist; know that your homophobia will find you out; underneath we're all the same, yik yak yik yak. But overall, the art form is governed by a cuddly conservatism, a well-meant ""to thine own self be true"" mantra, largely devoid - unless there's a monster or a foreigner - of any questions larger than ""who do you want to shag?"", and any ethics larger than, ""should you be shagging both those people at the same time?"". All this generates much worry about the state of culture, specifically American culture, and from there, the influence it has over British and global culture. And yet, if you do yourself the favour of watching telly instead, the standards are radically different. Never mind that a half-hour episode of The Simpsons has more reference, emotional complexity and political texture than probably the last decade of Eastwood's career. Nobody needs a lecture on how good The Wire is, or how hard you have to concentrate to watch The West Wing.  But I would contend that even the worst of big-hitting US telly - Brothers and Sisters, Desperate Housewives, Sex and the City - has a maturity, a degree of courage, an iconoclasm, that equivalently mainstream cinema would balk at. And it's straight demographics. The average age of the American cinemagoer is 19; in the UK it's 17. These are the top grossing films of this century: How the Grinch Stole Christmas, the first Harry Potter, Spider-Man, Finding Nemo, Shrek 2, Star Wars 3, Pirates of the Caribbean, Spider-Man 3, The Dark Knight. Female role models and political complexity seem irrelevant from this angle. This is no longer an adult's medium, and that's why it disappoints. But adults have peerless, brilliant culture, written just for them - it is sophisticated, taxing, beautiful to look at and delivered straight into their tellies. It's like having a Nobu takeout service on your road, but still complaining about McDonald's. It's not the concern of adults, whether the female role models are inspiring or not. It's time we cut cinema loose; it's not meant for us.  mszoewilliams@yahoo.co.uk",Zoe Williams: I give up on the movies,2009-02-25T00:01:00Z,Zoe Williams,world
"This should have been a week when the markets began their rebound. They should have been impressed at the progress being made in Washington to stem the crisis, and the prospects of the G20 meeting in London on 2 April, chaired by Gordon Brown, that will get to grips with it internationally. Instead Wall Street began to panic that the crisis is getting out of control – and world markets followed suit. The situation is ultra dangerous. The London summit is now very high stakes for Mr Brown, and indeed the world. It needs to be the moment when the leaders of countries representing 85% of world GDP sign up convincingly for a co-ordinated strategy that will restore confidence to the world's key interbank markets, the epicentre of the crisis. On top they need to declare a common and aggressive programme to remove fast the toxic assets crippling bank balance sheets, take the necessary public stakes in global banks to guarantee their creditworthiness, commit to creating ""good"" banks that can plug the worldwide lending gap, ensure that capital moves freely between countries and that money markets work. As matters stand it will far short of any such ""shock and awe"" intervention – despite Mr Brown's best efforts and his understandable if all too obvious desire to be once again seen as the international saviour. His problem is intellectual and political. There is no common intellectual understanding of why this crisis is so intractable, nor shared recognition of its profoundity, nor agreement on what to do. Worse, there is little political will to ensure that any action must be internationally co-ordinated and reinforced. The Obama administration is locked in internal wrangling, and few of the key American protagonists get that US action by itself, of whatever character, will be insufficient. A first-order global crisis is being dealt with piecemeal, nationally and behind the curve. Mr Brown does at least understand the need for international action, but has put most of his effort into building up the IMF. A weak IMF was at best only an indirect cause of this crisis; strengthening it, while important, will contribute to the solution only if it reinforces the measures listed above. One without the other will fail. It was good that Dominique Strauss Kahn, the urbane and engaging French managing director of the IMF was in London last week to join Brown in launching the countdown to the summit process, marked by the publication of the The Road to the London Summit. But how much better it would have been that instead of lofty talk about new ""early warning systems"", better future surveillance and the need for more IMF resources, they had talked about an action plan directly focused on reviving the global private financial system which they were designing IMF capacity to support. If on top they could have said they had Obama's full endorsement, Wall Street might have jumped 1,000 points instead of the baleful fall we witnessed. Brown's plan for the IMF is part of a proposed G20 global bargain that includes collectively boosting their economies, and eschewing protection. But even if he could win their agreement – difficult enough – the bargain does not go to the heart of the issue. Don't misunderstand me; better Brown's global deal than no deal. It is just that the deal would be so much more effective if it could find common intellectual ground – and then shared international action – on how directly to put the banking system on its feet. The British analysis itself reveals the weaknesses. The document efficiently tells the unfolding story of the financial crisis – from the first difficulties in the summer of 2007 as American sub-prime mortgages go sour through the collapse of Lehman brothers last September to the continued contraction in credit flows now. It spells out how the collapse of confidence and the worldwide implosion of the wholesale money markets has hit the business model of all lending institutions (provoking the bankruptcy of some), which has triggered a downward vortex of falling asset prices, colossal bank balance sheet write downs and contracting credit. But then, instead of spelling out how this must be addressed directly and internationally, it jumps to a softer set of recommendations about economic expansion and reviving the IMF. The IMF is an intergovernmental institution that lends to governments. It is not designed to put global private wholesale money markets back on their feet, bail out private banks and capitalise new ones This is what governments must address together. The IMF's potential role is to be a forum for such discussions and then try to ensure the intergovernmental financial framework is sufficiently robust to support the chosen measures; but Dominque Strauss Kahn does not need to wait until April. He can begin the process now. His problem along with Brown's is that any conversation without the Americans is useless. The downward lurch of the markets last week tells us all we need to know. The markets are increasingly fearful that governments are not getting hold of the core of the problem – the fact that the business model of nearly all the top banks is dependent upon money markets that only had their depth and breadth because they succeeded in tapping global savings, and apparently guaranteeing every participant that they could sell any asset at any time. That capacity and confidence has been shredded. And while it is dead the process of unwinding credit, falling property values, stricken banks, slumping economic activity and contracting credit will continue. This is what G20 governments must address directly. The elements exist; they have not been brought together. The world's central bankers must follow the US Federal Reserve in its willingness to make money markets work by being an aggressive market maker of last resort. Restoring confidence in banks' creditworthiness and capacity to handle unknown toxic debts demands that governments take majority stakes in every institution with more than $1 billion of deposits. I would hold back on full nationalisation as only a last resort. Regulation needs to curb the casino character of the markets, potentially splitting commercial and so-called investment banking. Lending, especially mortgage lending, needs to be better insulated, as Brown proposed  in his Observer article on Sunday. And each government should commit to create new ""good"" banks, with taxpayer support, to which domestic and overseas depositors can confidently deposit and begin new lending. Brown should give a lead on this too. The IMF can not do any of this directly. What it can do is to make the international system support the drive for new lending. It needs to guarantee that countries' economic policies are sufficiently sound so there will not be violent exchange rate movements that frighten the movement of capital which supplies the wholesale money markets. This will mean a quintupling in its lending power to a trillion dollars so that it can stand behind countries when in need. And it will need every member country to pre-agree that it will obey IMF instructions – including G7 countries like the US, France and the UK. China should be told that if it wants more clout then it must make the reminmbi a fully-convertible reserve currency; otherwise it must remain outside the world's inner councils. In other words every G20 country, including the US, needs to recognise their interdependence and responsibility. They must deploy co-ordinated government heft to underwrite broken banks and shattered confidence. Their actions can be cemented by a strengthened IMF to which they cede genuine economic sovereignty – and which itself must become more accountable. Then Brown's global bargain might get some economic purchase and put a floor under the global economy. Brown faces formidable obstacles to make the April summit rise to the challenges, but his task as chairman is to confront world leaders with these truths. It will demand risk, leadership and courage. But better that than generalised guff. The circumstances demand no less. • This article was amended on 25 February 2009. It originally said Brown proposed splitting commercial and investment banking in an Observer article; in fact Brown wrote that he did not envisage such a change.

"Isn't it time a man had a go at being Tessa Jowell? Even her friends must admit that, given her impetuous style of personal finance, at least where her newly convicted husband David Mills is concerned, she is not the ideal figurehead for the economic catastrophe that is the 2012 Olympics. Not that one wants to pick on Tessa. She is having a difficult enough time protesting the innocence of a man who, by his own admission, ""turned some very tricky corners"" for Silvio Berlusconi. But in the current climate, with the values of steadiness and thrift finally prevailing over fecklessness and greed, it is becoming customary to ask for a sex change at the top. In Iceland, the transformation is already underway. Last October, women replaced the men under whose leadership two of the country's major banks were devastated. ""Men, especially young men, made a mess of things,"" explained Kristjan Kristjansson, the prime minister's spokesman. But if distance from the financial mismanagement were paramount in the choice of their successors, the Icelandic authorities could surely have gone further. Rather than promote women who did not, so far as one knows, blow Icelandic whistles when their colleagues took spectacularly stupid risks, a new management team might have been picked from the ranks, say, of retired cod fishermen. In this way, the public would be reassured that those deputed to sort out the mess could not possibly be the same people who caused it. On the other hand, headlines such as ""Testosterone to blame"" inevitably associate all men, hormonally, with a financial crisis which is coming to be considered as much a form of gendered, antisocial behaviour as starting wars or stealing rare birds' eggs. It is worrying, certainly, to think of the same explosive hormone circulating through nurses, bus drivers and primary school teachers and even the male cabinet ministers whose conduct presumably informed a recent remark from Hazel Blears. ""Maybe,"" she said, ""if we got some more women in the boardrooms, we perhaps wouldn't have seen this kind of risk-taking behaviour."" Maybe if they'd got more Muslims in, it wouldn't have happened either. An aversion to usury might have dimmed, somewhat, the appeal of collateral debt obligations. Still, as fashionable historians often remind us, there is nothing wrong with a bit of counterfactual speculation, particularly where the alternative under consideration is not wholly implausible. Ask yourself, for example: what if a major political party such as the Tories were to be run by a woman? Would it lead to a kinder, more compassionate politics? Though it might be fanciful to speculate on the fate of Catholicism had Martin Luther been a woman or that of Europe had Hitler been one too (though the improvement in his table manners might have been significant), it is not difficult to imagine a City with more Nicola Horlicks at the top. What if the four abject figures who recently appeared in front of the select committee had been greedy, shifty, overpaid women instead? In a discussion of this question which appeared in the Observer last week, investment banking and pensions expert Dr Ros Altmann said that ""female values"", such as ""a caring mind-set, a nurturing mind-set, a mind-set that says let's worry about the future"", had been sadly absent from the City, where the culture had been instead ""very short term and very much about instant gratification"". The fact that so few examples present themselves of female employees trying but failing to correct this disreputable culture does not, of course, mean that a larger contingent of entirely different women would not have made a difference. A job in the City, in its pre-2009 format, probably appealed to the averagely caring, nurturing woman about as much as a chance to do some humble, behind-the-scenes pro bono work may now attract Tony Blair. In any workplace, there is a tendency for managers to appoint staff in their own image. Though, as we know from various high-profile cases, even women who were attracted to the City, with its proud history of greed, dodginess and lap-dancing clubs, often experienced such discrimination from colleagues that they were obliged to start lawsuits for millions of pounds in compensation. As a rule, when their treatment was discussed by commentators, the City would not be criticised for its macho culture of risk-taking and short-termism so much as its sexist refusal to let women share in the rewards. Didn't women bankers have just as much right to compete for bonuses? How dare anyone suggest they could not be just as vile and reckless? It's a bit counterfactual, admittedly, but what if the women whose complaints about lap dancing and glass ceilings attracted so much attention had also mentioned that their colleagues' tidal surges of testosterone were about to bring about a global financial collapse? Now the rampant-hormone school of thought proposes that women were, indeed, temperamentally disqualified for City work in its irresponsible, pre-crunch condition, on account of their morally superior qualities. The suggestion immediately invites, as reductive biological determinism always has, less flattering forms of sexual stereotyping. Given the cost, particularly to women, of exaggerated claims of gender difference, and the persuasiveness of the ""gender similarities hypothesis"", which states that males and females are alike on most, though not all, psychological variables, it is bizarre to find so many of the current beneficiaries of sexual equality attacking one of the pillars of equal opportunities. Was Larry Summers, the much reviled former president of Harvard, any more essentialist when he attributed women's under-representation at the top of science and engineering to intrinsic intellectual inferiority than a writer who now says that a superior ""nurturing"" side makes women the obvious choice to repair the City's testosterone-damaged institutions? Where do we stand on PMT? To see the reality of male-female sex difference, in all its wonderful complexity, we need look no further than the British cabinet. Women have a nurturing and cautious influence? Didn't every woman in the cabinet vote to invade Iraq? An innate aversion to risk and short-term greed? Must we return to Jowell's bribe-funded mortgage, of which she still claims she was ignorant, or Smith's second home scam? Are women more co-operative, more calm and less hierarchical than men? With Blears jabbing at Harman, while the latter plots against Brown for the leadership? Just as the banks rewarded horrible behaviour in a particular subset of men, the higher echelons of politics appear to encourage the antics of a particular sort of second-rate, power-obsessed, preachy yet surprisingly unprincipled woman. It is quite natural to find such women repellent. But would any of them be better if they were John Prescott?",Catherine Bennett: So you think women would have saved us.

"The National Trust is opening up space for 1,000 allotments on its land. This news frightens me. I am not scared of vegetables, apart from celeriac. It's more the image this conjures up. You don't think of the National Trust as having a load of muddy patches. You think of pristine lawns and speciality architectural grass. And now immediately I'm thinking Dig for Victory campaign during the second world war with Hyde Park in London being churned up because of a dire emergency just round the corner. All because of the Germans, the lawns were covered in goats and the banks of the Serpentine were marred by the stench of a piggery. Actually, that's not true, you don't keep pigs near water in case they fall in, and plus they are very clean animals who don't stink. But the Blitz spirit is all very well; what if it's accompanied by a Blitz? The goats, by the way, were reared for milk. Who knew our grandparents' palate was so adventurous and cosmopolitan? If we were prepared to eat goat's milk by the 1940s, you have to ask, did we really need to have that huge war? Andy McLaughlin, the head of communications at the National Trust, disposes of this mental picture.  ""It's a mixture of land, some of it walled kitchen gardens that have fallen into disuse, some of it's agricultural land - we have 2000 smallholdings, we could reclaim some of that - and we have other areas of arable land. It wouldn't be bits of park,"" he explains. But what says next strikes a chill into my bones: ""We're also doing it to plug the skills gap, so that people who are growing their own vegetables for the first time can learn from our experienced gardening volunteers.""  I had only just vaporised the spectre of the credit crunch being as devastating as a massive-scale aerial bombardment, and now he raises the skills gap. The recession isn't as bad as a war, but we're heading for an environmental apocalypse anyway, in which the ability to grow your own carrots is going to be really pretty crucial. McLaughlin did not actually say that. I just inferred it.  The recession is confusing, and for reasons beyond, ""but where did all the money go? Surely that cricket man can't have spent it all?"" On the one hand the recession dovetails quite neatly with a general message of austerity that's emanated from environmentalism since its beginnings, but that the mainstream has only in the past five years taken up. They do work pretty well together, greenness and the end of capitalism, like two ponies in a trap, and it wouldn't do us any harm to learn how that works, either, but later, later ...  We have to spend less; that's OK, we have nothing to spend. We have to generate less stuff; that's OK, too because nobody will buy it. And yet the tension between environmentalism and economic collapse emerges as soon as you start to think about anything longer term than next week; people talking about the economy do so in cycles. Nobody's saying it won't be painful, but the aim is recovery, a return to the status quo before we, inevitably, mess it all up again. We want a correction, we can't live like delinquents all our lives, spending money as if it were just theoretical notches on valueless bits of plastic ... well, some of us can live like that, but we can't all live like that. And yet we don't want a total reversal. We cannot all start saving, business will seize up completely and we'll be mired in this for years. Nevertheless, we need to rediscover the mind-set that leads people to save instead of spend: rediscover it, and then not listen to it. It would help if we were all doing different things, if I knew you were saving, I could offset you by buying a car.  Such sharing of valuable information is the kind of thing the internet is meant to be good for, and yet I know nothing of anybody's spending patterns. I don't think I'm being deliberately naive: there is genuine complication here, the opposite of greenness, which is not complicated at all. That is a straightforward, just stop it. Stop spending, stop importing, stop travelling, just stop doing all this stuff. Take all that energy you once used to get to Marbella to grow a lettuce. You will probably even get a tan, but only on the back of your neck and the bit where your vest doesn't meet your trousers. These two ponies aren't pulling the same trap after all, these ponies are having a fight. I wonder what that looks like; probably somebody in Hyde Park during the war could have told us.  I was amazed to discover that there are 100,000 people on the allotment waiting list. I've ummed and aahed for ages thinking of a way to say this, but there's only one: it must be all almost-old people. Mate, I am as soul sick as you are of people surveying their own generation via dinner parties, but I have canvassed all my friends and all my sister's friends which - I can verify with the aid of Facebook - verify is nearly 300 people (some of whom are the same), and the closest we have to an allotment is the following: one couple has a wormery; one has a field attached to her house in the country, but she is so unusual she has already been in Sainsbury's magazine. ""She had her kids at 24,"" my sister said, as though the interjection of this knowledge said it all.  This person - I do know her name but I feel bad dropping it. I feel that she belongs to supermarket chain - had already broken the trammels of convention, and leapt into the future, by having children earlier than, I don't know, 34. No wonder she grows her own foodstuffs. She probably powers her shower through a solar panel made out of a radiator. Other than that, it's just a load of people with ""living"" basil on their windowsill (it's not alive, just eat the bloody thing and put it out of its misery).  All my uncles have an allotment, but if you have to wait until your 60s, well, that is an incredibly long waiting list. You could get into the MCC or the Groucho sooner than that, though at least on an allotment you will never be swindled by a tycoon or offered coke by Keith Allen. Something else to bear in mind, if you do put your name down, though I should point out there will be 100,000 people before you, is that the yield on a plot of land is always bigger than you expect. My uncle Richard always says, ""Do you want some asparagus?"" I always say, ""Yes"", and then he'll give me, like, a crate of it. Like it's fallen off the back of a lorry. I always feel like I'm being fenced.  For nearly 10 years, I've been trying to devise the quintessential Guardian-reader whinge, which I could then make into a badge, and I would no longer have to carry around or even read the Guardian.

"The prime minister loves bankers with an all-consuming passion. When historians come to analyse the winter of 2008/9 they might recall the discovery many years ago of the remains of a long-lost couple in the Sahara, their skeletons picked clean by time and locked in a final coital embrace. Thus they will find Gordon Brown and the City of London.  Brown surrounds himself with bankers, ex-bankers and bankers-to-be. They are to him what Etonians were to Macmillan - a social comfort blanket. He seeks their company, heeds their advice and defends their interest against all-comers. To Brown, as goes the City, so goes the nation.  Last week the directors of RBS were reported to have gone off their rockers. They were preparing to pay £1bn in staff bonuses because, according to the chairman, Sir Philip Hampton, the bank needs to ensure that its staff remained motivated. In which case why was he bothering to pay them salaries?  Brown's aides panicked and pleaded with RBS to curb its squandering of public money, but the bank, with Brown in its pocket, did little more than refashion the sum and trim it to some £750m. Bradford and Bingley, another bank rescued from bankruptcy, protested that its bonuses had to be paid because they were contractual and ""not linked to performance"". What were they then, a pensions fiddle?  Just to show there is no hard feeling among chums, Brown's Financial Services Authority, whose specific job was to detect the bonus poison in the banking system, is celebrating its most disastrous year ever by awarding itself £33m in bonuses from the taxpayer. There is to be no repeat in London of Congress's banning of bonuses until each bailed-out institution hands back its federal subsidies. The cynicism of the farrago beggars belief.  I admire the City and support capitalism, and did so when Brown was still a ranting anti-Thatcherite in the 1980s. But his conversion has become an infatuation. Anyone in contact with public opinion - politicians, newspapers, etc - reports genuine rage at the behaviour of the banks. This may be unfair on most bank workers who toil without bonuses. But the truth is that their seniors miscalculated and drove them to bankruptcy. Bankruptcy is no respecter of rank.  The government singled out the banks for rescue because it was panic-stricken at savers losing their deposits and credit lines being closed to businesses. Had there been no rescue, bonus contracts would have been worthless. Promises made during a financial bubble are fine until the parties to them are mugged by reality. Then every man looks to his own.  For reasons that now seem short-sighted, £500bn was given or lent by the government to banks with no control over what happened to it. Never has so much been blown to so little effect. Ministers were terrified of nationalisation, and so secured all its costs and none of its benefits.  That said, they could reasonably argue that the largesse given to the banks was covered by a moral contract to maintain credit lines and the banks ratted on the contract. Of the £1bn given to underpin small business loans through the Small Business Finance Scheme, barely £20m is reported to have been used for that purpose. Instead the bank directors behaved as was to be expected. They were like bank robbers who, having filled their van with loot, decided not to share it with the rest of the gang and hightailed it to Brazil. Most of the money vanished into balance sheets, used to write off what amounted to traders' gambling debts.  Some was retained for bonuses. That directors should have even contemplated giving rescue money to themselves or their staff shows how detached they were from reality. Courtesy of the taxpayer, they all had bonuses already, their jobs. It took the former chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, to retort that ""if someone came and told me there were legally binding bonuses ... I would have said, sue and be damned.""  Part of the trouble is that the bonus culture, so abused in the case of bankers, is no less abused elsewhere in the private and even public sectors, and with equally deleterious effect. Professional partnerships or firms such as John Lewis share annual profits equitably among their staff. That is reasonable. It is quite different from the Christmas bonanzas dished out to each other by senior bank staff largely because ""everybody does it"".  The economist, JK Galbraith, has returned to fashion thanks to The Great Crash of 1929, but another work of his that deserves equal attention is 2004's The Economics of Innocent Fraud. He long argued that big pay settlements for executives were little more than grand larceny, legitimised by the pretence that they were subject to shareholder, auditor and regulatory oversight. Executive pay has raced ahead of average incomes in recent years. Such reckless remuneration, said Galbraith, was no more than ""a warm personal gesture by an individual to himself"", or in the case of bonuses by a group of individuals, to each other.  Galbraith added that such behaviour is not confined to private business. Privatisation has rendered ""mythical"" the distinction between private and public sectors. They are intermingled in a welter of private finance deals and revolving doors. Raids on the public purse by consultants and IT firms under Blair and Brown constituted what Galbraith would have called ""a far from innocent fraud"", no less so for having been sanctioned by ministers and officials in receipt of hospitality bribes.  Brown's occasional strictures on bank bonuses are thus hypocritical coming from him. He has remarked that ""anyone associated with a loss"" should not be rewarded, yet his Treasury tolerates five-figure bonuses to public servants in the Olympic Delivery Authority, Network Rail, the NHS, the BBC and Ofcom among others. None declares a profit and these agencies are already characterised by paying their staff exceptionally high salaries.  Why do these exotics need the prospect of extra financial motivation just to do their jobs properly? Who are they who claim to be unprepared to honour their contracts, add value to their organisations or serve the public interest without a Christmas bung? The bonus culture, based on easy access to surplus cash, is the worst sort of greed, competitive greed. Gordon Brown has supported it to the hilt.  I agree with Galbraith. The bonus culture is skim, bribery, corporate theft. Were it intended as a genuine boost to effort, money could be saved by also reducing pay as the year progressed where requisite effort is not forthcoming. In other words, pay would be adjusted in line with personal performance. Nobody does that, any more than they return bonuses when the deals on which they were based turn bad.  The answer is simple. Performance-related pay is called salary. Bonuses should be beneath the dignity of professionals, as bribes should be beneath the dignity of commerce. That bonuses to the rich should now be paid from the taxes of the poor is inexcusable. They should be banned in banks rescued from bankruptcy, as in America, until such time as state subsidies are repaid in full. I imagine that will take a long time. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com","Simon Jenkins: Bonus culture is skim, bribery, theft.

"When I hear a politician proclaiming his localism I count the spoons. Tony Blair said he would end rate-capping and did not. Gordon Brown said he would restore civic enterprise by giving business rates back to cities and did not. Ministers such as David Miliband, Ruth Kelly and Hazel Blears put on smocks, stuck straw in their hair and talked of parish forums and kitties and stakeholders. They were all hard-core centralists who have given themselves the greatest concentration of state power in Europe. The Tory leader, David Cameron, protests his localism every year, but he is as Augustinian as his opponents. Give me decentralisation, he cries, but not yet, and certainly not should I be in office. Think of the power I might lose. Think of the blooming of a hundred Borises. In his latest discourse on localism, in these pages yesterday, Cameron repeated that his heart is still close to home and hearth. But they all say that. His much spun ""radical power shift"" from centre to locality is merely a rehash of his last one. He wants an ""end to one-size-fits-all solutions dispensed from the centre ... to give local councils more power and more responsibility."" So do we all. But it means giving them freedom over resources, and Cameron does not want that, probably because his shadow chancellor, George Osborne, is a card-carrying Treasury centralist. There is no point in discussing localism without talking money. With no discretion over money, local councils are mere agencies of the centre. Like Blair, Cameron says he will end rate-capping. Like Blair he then explains why he will not do so. He proposes that council-tax payers could tick their tax demand if it is above ""a certain threshold"" (fixed by Cameron). Which would trigger a referendum to have it overturned. It is hard to imagine anyone faced by a rising demand not making that tick. Councils would stick to the threshold as they do the cap. Life would be no different.  This is anyway a repackaging of what is in place already. Councils have held tax referendums in Milton Keynes, Croydon, Bristol and elsewhere. The proposal does not dismantle the apparatus of central spending assessment or the formulaic ""silos"" by which Whitehall ensures conformity to targets and programmes. It is not a return even to the modified discretion allowed before Thatcher's capping of the 1980s. The Tory leader has set his face firmly against the fiscal discretion available elsewhere in Europe. Like Brown, he trusts electors to pass judgment on national taxes, but not local ones. Nor will he contemplate reforming local government to give councils access to a buoyant revenue source, such as a share of income or business tax. Cameron's gimmick is from the fiscal dark ages. He repeats his laudable desire to be rid of regional government, but this has been diluted to ending regional agency powers over local housing and planning - sound but hardly radical. He wants councils to have ""general competence"" to do as they like, but this is meaningless when he will give them no real discretion over revenue, key to the revival of cities everywhere in the world. Yesterday's one ostensibly new idea was for referendums on elected mayors in a dozen cities. But such referendums can be held already. The only difference is that Cameron wants to insist on them. Since his party hates such direct election as threatening its local power bases, it will doubtless join Labour and Lib Dems in campaigning for no votes. We shall be no further forward. This is disappointing. From one side of the Tory mouth we get a howl against ""one-size-fits-all centralism"", and from the other we get daily protests against ""postcode lotteries"". The political brain is clearly not in gear. Localism involves breaking some political eggs, but Cameron seems desperate to break none. Tories should travel abroad and examine not just how other cities have pulled themselves out of post-industrial torpor, but how they are girding themselves to relieve recession, with handouts and tax cuts not allowed to localities in Britain. These cities will recover from recession far quicker as a result. Cameron confronts a government whose central institutions are more dysfunctional than for over a century. Not a week passes without some revelation of the dire state of Whitehall, of reckless freebies, mad-cap computer purchases, bonuses, revolving-door consultancies and utter waste of public money. The Tories seem hardly to care. Earlier this month Cameron's colleagues agreed not to mention the home secretary's expenses fiddle for fear she might reveal theirs. Meanwhile they wish to keep in place draconian controls on a tier of government that, by every audited measure, is more efficient and less wasteful than Whitehall. The reluctance of politicians to trust people to reach mature decisions on how they are governed is paralleled by the recession. They are equally reluctant to let people spend their way out of deflation by boosting consumer demand, even if it means 3 million unemployed. To Westminster the proper use of taxpayers' money is not to refocus it on high street spending through tax cuts or benefits or direct employment, but to lose it in bank balance sheets. For all the abuse parliament likes to hurl at bankers, it prefers them to local consumers. It would rather take their advice than leave money in the pockets of the spending public. Banks get £500bn, which instantly vanishes, while consumers get £12bn in VAT relief. Councils remain capped, with worse to come. The establishment is more gripped than ever by its faith in the denizens of Whitehall and the City. Brown clearly believes that only bankers know how to rescue the economy, and is prepared to bankrupt a generation to prove it. Likewise, only ministers and civil servants know how to run public services. People as consumers or voters have no role in this realm. Rarely have they been so at the mercy of oligarchy. This week a Latin American demagogue, Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, was ridiculed for seeking an unlimited term of office ""to complete"" what is widely held to be a disastrous policy of social control. As British politicians scrabble about like chickens in the mud, looking for ways out of their own mess, they seem much the same. They have no intention of diluting or delegating their power to the mass of the people. They want to be the only ones left free to make a hash of things, for ever. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com",Simon Jenkins: One thing unites Brown and Cameron: fear of 100 Borises,2009-02-18T00:01:00Z,Simon Jenkins,politics
"Obama's America is a fractious, apprehensive country. There may be a freshly elected administration but, despite the new leader's vaunting rhetoric appealing to unity and reflecting the evident concern of ordinary Americans, the political and financial elite are reluctant to rally to a common cause. The ideological divides that have racked the US remain as entrenched as ever. Obama may be a champion of the importance of government, but he and the Democrats have a long battle to convert a political victory into an intellectual one. Yet almost every block in New York, like everywhere else in the US, has shops closing down as visible evidence of an ever deepening recession - and the need for wholesale change in the way the US is economically governed.  Last week should have been triumphant. The president won congressional agreement for his record near $800bn economic stimulus package, which, despite all the horse-trading, still contains enough worthwhile ""shovel ready"" infrastructure, energy and environmental spending to give the US economy a much-needed boost. Meanwhile, treasury secretary Tim Geithner signalled his intent to trigger up to $2.5 trillion in public and private spending to restore the US financial system to health - unfortunately he knew not how. This was the Big Beasts mobilising resources on a mega scale. In British terms, it was as if Alistair Darling had found £90bn on top of already record borrowing to boost the economy - and more than £200bn to address the British financial crisis. Yet neither was received well, in part because the Obama team is ill adept at getting beyond the slogans - such as the need to create 3.5 million jobs - and explaining how and why. They need to. The familiar arguments in Britain about the prudence of huge borrowing are replayed here with even more passion. Fiscal conservatism is a creed adopted with religious fervour; a Washington conservative prayer breakfast is never complete without devotees invoking God to curb public spending, lower taxes and eliminate borrowing. Even the normally sane John McCain called the package ""generational theft"". On the face of it, the numbers are scary; a budget deficit, including the spending on the banks, that will approach 14% of GDP in 2009/10. Such is the result of a toxic combination: Bush's outrageous legacy; the breaking of banks; and the need for the government to spend when the American consumer, unnerved by a collapsed property market and spreading gloom, is not. To build a bridge from here to where the US needs to be requires economic daring and a bold belief in the future. Obama is good - and he showed just what a formidable force he is when he took to the road to sell his economic package. But what is beginning to look doubtful is whether he can build around him a buttressing team who share the same passion and capacity as President Roosevelt had in similar economic circumstances. Obama has no equivalent of Roosevelt's two key lieutenants, Harry Hopkins, who led the fight for work, or Jesse Jones, who took on rebuilding the financial system. Instead he is resolutely following his hero Abraham Lincoln, trying vainly to build a cabinet of all the talents. Apparently he gives every new cabinet member Doris Kearns Goodwin's biography of Lincoln, Team of Rivals. But Lincoln had a majestic moral cause - the abolition of slavery - before which even political rivals buried their differences. There is a great cause now, but for conservatives, the moral threat of Big Government exceeds even that of capitalism. Obama has to challenge them rather than charm them. And he needs some can-do allies. An indicator of the dangers he runs came last week when a Republican nominee he had named for commerce secretary, Senator Judd Gregg, captured the headlines when he suddenly withdrew his nomination. Gregg explained that he could not work alongside colleagues committed to spending, tax cuts and consequential borrowing that he considered entirely wrong.  It is this incapacity to trump the voodoo belief systems that have laid the US and world so low that is so dismaying and dispiriting. We are living through nothing less than the disintegration of the global financial system, shattering the western banking systems' capacity to lend. The risk is growing of a worldwide debt deflation. The west's governments have no choice but to put their balance sheets behind their broken banks and to make good the consumer demand that is no longer there via fiscal policy. They may even collectively have to print money, much more effectively done together than separately. Yet conservatives deny these truths. The acute problem is that, although the old order and ideas do not work, there is no consensus on what the new order and ideas will be. The lack of coherence is plaguing these early weeks of Obama's drive for economic recovery. Thus Geithner's disappointing speech last Tuesday setting out the next steps in his financial recovery programme, and then stone-walling the senate budget committee the following day. The administration wants to act decisively along the same lines as Sweden in the early 1990s in putting its banking system back on its feet. But it hesitates to nationalise banks as Sweden did. And it hesitates to commit what could be 14% of American GDP in creating a ""bad bank"" to take over crippling toxic debt as the Swedes did. It wants the same ends, but cheaper - an intellectual challenge too far. Geithner's solution is to enlist the private sector but even in partnership with the government, the trouble is that there is no way any scheme can buy bad loans and toxic assets for any one bank without negotiating their price. The resulting valuation will become a benchmark for all banks, and thus reveal the potential total losses for the overall system. These are stunning. The IMF says they could be $2.2 trillion; New York University's Professor Nouriel Roubini, whose forecasts of the extent of the crisis have proved accurate so far, last week released figures suggesting that, assuming another 20% fall in house prices, the number could be as high $3.5 trillion. He declared that the ""US banking system is effectively insolvent"". But when the property market recovers, the losses will recede. In Sweden the government's ""bad bank"" recovered almost all the losses as the economy improved. The same would happen in the US. To get on that virtuous circle the banks have to start lending again - but they won't and can't when they are engulfed with bad debts. The government has got to bite the bullet and either insure up to $3.5 trillion of bad debt; or establish a ""bad bank"" to hold it; or some combination of both. And it will need to supply extra capital to banks that are particularly stricken. Whatever it does, the cost is much more expensive than the $150bn left over from the $700bn ""Tarp"" bank rescue plan established by George Bush and former US treasury secretary Hank Paulson in the autumn. Yet going back to congress to ask for more money on this scale is a political nightmare. Bankers are public enemy Number One. American bankers, like their British counterparts, have been slow to get the message. The closure of the markets on which their business model depended is seen as an unpredictable act of God rather than the consequence of their abuse. And the argument that they need to pay high bonuses to retain talent is rightly mocked. What talent? The news that Merrill Lynch paid $1bn in bonuses despite record losses and a taxpayer bail-out has inflamed public opinion.  Buried in the 1,000-page recovery plan are measures to limit bonuses to one third of base pay, which, with the proposed $500,000 salary cap, is a swingeing assault on bank remuneration. Bankers are in no position to complain. Their avarice and the scale of their business misjudgment have vastly complicated the politics of a bank bail-out, which will have to be on a stupefying scale to be effective. The open question is whether the US can afford to create a ""bad bank"" or equivalent that might cost up to 14% of GDP, on top of a budget deficit already of that same size. The answer is that it cannot afford not to do it. Otherwise it might suffer the same fate as Japan in the 1990s, whose refusal to accept the size of the problem meant that it temporised with half measures - and suffered a decade of economic stagnation.  This should have been the number-one agenda item on the G7 meeting of finance ministers in Rome this weekend. Geithner could have flown in with a coherent plan, rallied support for it and urged other countries to follow his lead. He has not and cannot. Nor will he meet other finance ministers who have worked up rescue models. Instead everyone is doing their own thing, typified by the British. We launched our asset protection scheme in January with no prior consultation with other governments. It is not a bad scheme, but unless governments act in concert they have no hope of success. Britain's once deep and broad money markets were the result of global capital inflows. They cannot be restored by the British government alone.  Yet the G7 is a cacophony of different plans and preoccupations. Everybody, including Gordon Brown, is looking for legitimation for short-term political advantage. It needs the Obama administration to cut through the cackle and impose an agenda equal to the scale of what needs to be done at home and abroad. That inability is the gravest source of concern. There are signs that the Obama team is getting the message; it backed off the worst protectionist excesses in the Stimulus Bill, and both Obama and Geithner say we need decisive, large-scale action. The worry is that they will make too many concessions to the ideas and people who got us into this mess. Lincoln was a great man. But it is a Roosevelt America that the world needs now.",Will Hutton: Obama has picked the wrong hero for our times,2009-02-15T00:01:00Z,Will Hutton,world
"The companies, banks, accountants and consultants who have been paraded in the Guardian's remarkable sequence of articles on tax avoidance over the last fortnight include some of the bluest chip names in British business.  Some of the schemes have been closed, but be sure an enormous ""tax planning"" and ""wealth management"" industry will have devised new ones to take their place operating on similar principles. Either a way is found to hold assets, especially copyrights and patents, in tax havens or a network of circular transactions in artificial companies through tax havens is set up to make income disappear and magically reappear. And lo - tax that would have been paid is not. What is most dismal is the scale. Estimates vary but the best guess is that the lost tax approaches 1% of GDP. Half the schemes are devised by our big four accountancy firms - the epitome of reputability. Nearly a third of our top 700 companies pay no tax at all. At best, the spirit of the law is being obstructed. How do they justify to themselves what they do? It is true that the international tax system is fiendishly complex, and it is reasonable for companies to ensure that they do not pay tax when they do not need to. This is legitimate tax planning. What the Guardian has reported goes well beyond that. When it comes to taxation a different moral compass opens up. Over the years I have had many heated arguments with ""tax planners"". Always it gets to the same core point: the state has no right to have my cash. Big Government is a moral bad and, worse, will necessarily squander my money on ill-conceived projects creating welfare dependency - for that is what governments do. I can spend my money better than it can. I am the buccaneering libertarian fighting an important moral battle in avoiding tax. It is this ideology, generated and fanned by American neoconservatives, that the tax avoider tells him or herself as they purchase or devise the latest scheme. It is first cousin to the ideology that justified financial liberalisation: Big Government had no place telling financial institutions how to organise and regulate their affairs, because markets of private financiers will always tend to deliver efficient results.  Much of the ""deregulated"" business of the structured investment departments of our big banks - the epicentre of the credit crunch - was driven by tax avoidance, justified by an appeal to the same set of ideas.  The economic wreckage is now all around us. There is a particular irony in Lloyds being accused by the government in court this week for its part in tax avoidance schemes even while it owes its very existence to a British tax base whose solidity the bank is undermining. Other banks will be similarly compromised because one of the dynamics of securitisation is ""tax efficiency"", moving income flows from artificial company to artificial special purpose vehicles in tax havens. Tax avoidance was a central part of yesterday's exploded financial structure. The stench is overpowering. The takeover of Boots by the private equity firm KKR has become exposed as a transfer of wealth from the taxpayer to its astonishingly rich partners, only one of whom is domiciled in the UK, for tax purposes. The headquarters is moved to Zug to avoid tax. Nottingham is stripped of key jobs. Boots no longer pays UK corporate tax because the interest on the debt overwhelms its profits. And the banks that lent KKR the money, now worth between 60 and 70 pence in every pound because of doubts about whether it can be fully repaid, have to be bailed out by the self-same taxpayer. No wealth is generated. It is transferred. How the libertarians, self-styled wealth generators and fighters against Big Government must mock the little people whom they run rings around. But it is only because of the derided state that we have even the semblance of a functioning financial system. We now know that capitalism without the state is inoperable. For decades companies and banks have insisted we are privileged to have them trade in our economies and societies; unless we indulge them with ""tax friendly"" policies they will incorporate elsewhere where tax is lower - even as they justify tax avoidance before they do so.  It was an ideological fiction. Firms, markets and states are interdependent and firms should contribute towards the exchequer to the extent their assets, employees and turnover are located in the UK, thus not escaping tax with today's ruses.  Such a framework is not hard to devise - work is already under way in the European commission - nor is it hard to devise a system of international transfer of information, including from tax havens, to ensure that companies abide by the rules. There will be inevitable wrinkles in the system that cannot be harmonised as individual governments use tax breaks to try to encourage some forms of economic activity over others. But the scale of tax avoidance could be radically reduced. What is required is the will. Neoconservatism has collapsed. The western financial system is bust. The need for the state, and for international collaboration, is now evident to all. President Obama is keen to act. If we cannot slay tax avoidance now, we never will.",Will Hutton: Behind tax avoidance lies an ideology that has had its day,2009-02-14T00:01:00Z,Will Hutton,politics
"When historians come to judge the least edifying patronage scandal of recent years, it will not be cash for honours, which anyone with half a brain realised has been happening since time immemorial. No, they will surely settle on financial collapse for honours, the enchanting outreach programme whereby bankers were given baubles, government jobs and taskforces to chair, on the basis that extremely rich men must be right (I paraphrase slightly). I am as shocked as the next person that extremely rich men have turned out to be wrong, and this week watched the Treasury select committee grill those four senior bankers: see-no-evil, hear-no-evil, speak-no-evil, and please-no-call-me-evil. Which did you think was the ghastliest? I thought ex-HBOS man Andy Hornby, because he was the youngest-looking one, while the others already resembled fully fossilised city gents. It's a bit like why Davros was the most disturbing Dr Who villain. You could still glimpse the humanity.  And indeed, even looking at the desk place-names in that committee room there was a poignant sense of promise cut off at the knees, when comparing plain old Andy's card with those of his co-defendants - ""Lord Stevenson"", ""Sir Tom McKillop"", ""Sir Fred Goodwin"". Poor Andy has yet to get his title, and one suspects it will not be the inevitability it once was in his line of work. But what a feeder club the City has been, with Labour having given 23 bankers honours since 1997. Four of them scored life peerages, and seven were knighted. Three were made government ministers, two appointed to senior posts within Downing Street, 10 have been placed on eminent councils, seven on agencies and quangos, while just the 37 have been drafted in to head up taskforces, or sit on commissions and advisory bodies.  How errant were these knights - and how erroneous. Indeed, as we survey the wreckage of the banking system, the worry is rather less that they were given titles than that they were given responsibility in so many areas of government policy. These were not sinecures. Goodwin headed up taskforces examining both the New Deal and credit unions. Yesterday I unearthed his 2006 appearance before the Treasury committee, which praised him for opening basic bank accounts. ""There seems to be coming through quite a strong strand of public accountability and social conscience rather than profit,"" they fawned. Sir Fred's reply? ""I think they work hand in hand ..."" It would be funny if it weren't so bleeding tragic. Fred's social conscience appears to have been a demented expansionist dream that brought about the biggest losses in UK corporate history. It does rather make one wonder if his work on the New Deal and credit unions should be rehoused in a government file marked Do The Opposite Of This. Then of course there was former HBOS chief Sir James Crosby, who had done so much to drive mortgage insanity that he was naturally charged with reviewing the ailing mortgage market. He also headed the ID cards taskforce. And let's not forget Sir Derek Wanless, assigned the even littler matter of mapping the future of the NHS. Among his conclusions were a recommendation to tax junk food (amazing how non-laissez faire these bankers are when it comes to people other than themselves), and lots of lectures about the public needing to ""take responsibility"" for themselves. We all have our limits, and I think being invited to consider the risks of a second portion of chips by a bloke who sat mutely on the Northern Rock audit and risk committee is probably mine. Alas, there isn't the space to continue this roll call of banker-public intellectual hybrids. But we must just salute investment banker turned government adviser David Freud, who authored the white paper on welfare reform, and came up with the ur-justification for all bankers seeking to persuade people of their eminent suitability for these complex public roles. ""I didn't know anything about welfare at all when I started,"" he breezed to reporters, ""but that may have been an advantage ... In a funny way the solution was obvious.""  Unpicking the vast and meaningful influence this lot have had over every aspect of government policy in recent years would be a Piranesian nightmare. But you'd hope we've been shocked into caution, and that getting bankers to formulate social policy will one day seem as bizarre and unthinkably embarrassing a custom of bygone times as The Black and White Minstrel Show.  Then again, don't hold out too much hope. When Gordon Brown took over as PM, his now somewhat compromised reputation for caution was mocked by one Westminster wag who said: ""When a bomb goes off, you can't call Derek Wanless to set up an 18-month review."" Can't you? The banking system's implosion would seem to be a matter of similar emergency, and this week we learned that Brown has only gone and called a banker, Sir David Walker, to chair a review into the way bank boards operate. If and when Sir David comes to choose his seat, let us hope he opts for Lord Walker of Cloud Cuckoo Land. marina.hyde@theguardian.com",It seems mad but Labour really did ask its Sirs to apply their genius to public policy and finance,2009-02-14T00:01:00Z,Marina Hyde,politics
"Away they all go, in the downturn's great cultural bonfire: high-street chains, conspicuous consumption, long lunches, the music industry, residual trust in our politicians – and now marriage. Well, kind of, anyway: the Office for National Statistics released figures yesterday showing marriage rates are now the lowest since records began in 1862: 3.3% down on 2006's figures, with a hulking 34% fall since 1981. There was a slight upward blip between 2002 and 2004 (you may remember a deluge of overexcited ""marriage is the new rock'n'roll"" pieces in the Sunday supplements), but no more: for the time being at least, people are spurning the aisle, cake and crap speeches in ever-increasing numbers. The role of our economic woes in all this remains largely unclear, though that hasn't stopped plenty of voices stating the obvious: if the average wedding now costs about £20,000 – and, really, think about that figure – then the downturn must be in there somewhere. ""If you are worried about redundancy or are a young couple who can't get a foot on the housing ladder,"" says one expert, ""getting married may not be a priority."" No kidding: at times like these, surely only the foolish or hopelessly romantic would blow the price of a decent house deposit on a single Saturday, with the cost of the honeymoon on top. And while we're here, can I also mention the grimly misogynistic and very expensive modern institution that is the stag weekend?  Now, I am happily partnered and somewhat resistant to what my Marxist friends used to malign as the ultimate bourgeois institution, and most of my opinions on wedlock proceed accordingly. There again, I confess to a certain ambivalence, partly based on how common cohabitation seemed to be among the leading lights of the New Labour project. Alastair Campbell, Stephen Byers and Alan Milburn, for example, are happily unmarried family men – a fact which has occasionally led me to think that getting hitched would be a worthwhile anti-Blairite gesture: thrillingly non-metropolitan, and a little bit Old Labour to boot. When I went to the wedding of a hard-bitten leftie friend at a trade union-owned stately home in Yorkshire, it seemed to fit the bill – though then again, the cost seemed just prohibitive as your standard capitalist, church-and-hotel-type affair. Here, I think, is the most important point, bound up with the cultural horrors of the boom years. This will sound rather adolescent, but what the hell: under that £20,000 price-tag there surely lurks the decisive transformation of an idea supposedly based on love, family and all the rest of it into yet another spend orgy. We've all seen it in action: wedding lists at Peter Jones, weeks of anxiety about the choice of wine, completely unnecessary insistences on morning suits, and hungover mornings spent cooing over washing machines and big televisions. If £20,000 was the average, then plenty of ordinary Joes were obviously spending much more, and for what? Meanwhile, those who fancied a bit of old-fashioned magic were trying to fuse all this indulgence with a quick dabble in organised religion. We all have hitherto secularist friends who have briefly affected godliness so as to bag the local parish church, and it's never pretty. So, there you have it: consumerism, spiritual doublethink and massed binge drinking. The archetypal modern wedding crystallised some of the more awful aspects of the last two decades, so let's celebrate its ongoing decline. And if a few less parties of thirtysomething Nuts readers will be disgracing themselves in Prague, more's the better.","John Harris: Marriage is on the decline, but let's face it: weddings crystallised all the worst aspects of the boom years",2009-02-13T13:30:01Z,John Harris,society
"Charles Darwin and Abraham Lincoln were born on the same day two centuries ago, thanks be to the false god of coincidence. But which, you cry, was the greater? Was it the man who transformed our understanding of the human race, or the man who made the mightiest nation on Earth also the custodian of liberty and democracy? Was it the scientist or the statesman? Darwin claims the crown for the scale of his intellectual revolution, but was he no more than an observer, a describer, a cataloguer? Did he not fail Marx's test, that any philosopher can interpret the world while ""the point is to change it""? On the other hand, Lincoln may have ensured that America became a force for world freedom, but was he not just a lucky war leader, and of a cause whose time had anyway come? The comparison is silly, but not the question. We can leave the two men as giants - except I suppose to a born-again Confederate creationist - but we can still set the pursuit of science against that of politics and ask which deserves the greater respect. Science may nowadays enjoy the status of medieval religion, but writing in this week's TLS, the ultra-Darwinian, Richard Dawkins, still presents his cause as that of a persecuted fraternity. In Britain, he wails, ""only 69% want evolution to be taught at all. In America 40% believe that life on Earth has existed in its present form since the beginning of time"". He claims that science teachers are ""under growing pressure from creationist lobbies, usually inspired by American or Islamic sources"". This is intellectual paranoia. The purported British figure of 31% ""anti-evolutionist"" probably reflects no more than an exasperation with boring science teaching. That is the fault of mis-selling by the currently all-powerful science lobby, not of Darwinism. If any scientific cause can be said to have triumphed in the last half century it is that of evolution. As Dawkins points out: ""The least you can say about evolutionary theory is that it works. All but pedants would go further and assert that it is true."" State subsidy to biological research dwarfs any tax relief to religious fundamentalists. The university megaliths spawned by Darwin's descendants mock the modest encampments of academic theology. Big science is very big. Darwin needs no apologists. Where in comparison stands Lincoln? This waffling country lawyer was killed by a madman after just five years in office and before anyone could tell what he would make of reconstruction. He might be just another ambitious politician had Robert E Lee not made the fatal mistake of invading Pennsylvania and losing the civil war. Lincoln's greatest stroke of luck was to have a reporter within earshot when he recited a few lines at the Gettysburg cemetery in 1863. They were to the unsensational effect that ""government of the people, by the people and for the people shall not perish from the Earth"". This was no more than had been asserted by the founding fathers, but the moment was apt. Lincoln saved the northern continent of America from the Balkanisation that overtook the south and certainly hastened the freeing of the slaves, but union would have come in time, as would emancipation. He built a coalition able to resist separatism - a debatable goal these days - and bound his nation to a common purpose. But he was a symbolic figure in a continuum rather than a revolutionary. Darwin was also part of a continuum. He built on the work of his grandfather, Erasmus, from whom he learned of biological variation and the survival of the fittest. As for natural selection, he came near to sharing the fate of Humphrey Gainsborough (co-inventor of the steam engine) and the early ""discoverers"" of America, in being almost beaten to the post by a rival biologist, in his case Alfred Russel Wallace. But this means only that history would have invented Darwin, as it would Lincoln, had they not existed. A more vivid contrast is between their respective fields of endeavour. In the two centuries since Darwin's birth, the profession of biological science has progressed immeasurably. Not only did his discoveries break through barriers and smother prejudices, so did his method, his open-mindedness and readiness to free the eye to see nature afresh. Politics has no such joyous narrative. Lincoln had only its crooked timber from which to work. His forerunner as president, John Adams, gloomily remarked: ""While all other sciences have advanced, government is at a stand; little better practised now than three or four thousand years ago."" Barbara Tuchman's compendium of military disaster, The March of Folly, sits on my desk as a daily reminder of the truth of that remark. To her it was amazing that, ""elsewhere than in government"", men could have raised rocks to soaring cathedrals, woven silk from worms, forged symphonies from base metal, voyaged to the moon and controlled or eliminated disease. To Tuchman, politics, even sanitised as statesmanship, seemed immune to such progress. Time and again - not least at present - the occupation of Lincoln has behaved in a way that seems no different from the chicanery of the Athenian demos. This week alone we had to witness the British government testing to destruction Darwin's survival of the fittest. Gordon Brown continued to wreck the British economy by his squirming subservience to bankers, while Jacqui Smith was so terrified by press scrutiny of her expenses that she crushed reason with prejudice over drugs. Compared with the dazzling horizons traversed by Darwin, Lincoln's world seems a squalid compromise, a sequence of reactionary policies, stupid wars, self-interest, cowardice and corruption, in which ever smaller men make ever greatest mistakes. Yet just as comparing two men born on the same day is essentially silly, so is the pitting of science against politics. Science is a linear dialectic, from thesis to antithesis to synthesis, from evidence to conclusion. Its challenges are notionally resolved by recourse to facts. Darwinians might feel threatened by religious fundamentalists, but the contest is of wisdom against fools. Politics has no such angels on its side. Its arguments are rarely susceptible to evidence - other than from unread history. Its conflicts are visceral and concern the interest of groups, taxes, privileges and vendettas. Politics reflects the basest emotions, and resolving them is difficult beyond the imagining of science. When Auden opined that no poem had ""saved one Jew from the gas chambers"", he might have been speaking for science as much as for literature or art. Only politics has that power to hand. I believe in the primacy of politics as a human activity for the simple reason that it is more important than anything else. Science must dance to its tune, not vice versa. The calibre of politicians is a crucial determinant of human happiness. Theirs is not a profession but the consummation of social activity. That is why Darwin died in his bed and Lincoln to an assassin's bullet. That is why Darwin gets my admiration, but Lincoln gets my vote. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com",Simon Jenkins: Scientist v statesman: who can call the battle of the bicentennial men?,2009-02-13T00:01:00Z,Simon Jenkins,politics
"Harry Hopkins, the chain-smoking, high-energy confidant of Franklin Roosevelt, passionately believed in the value of work and the destructive consequences of living on benefit. ""Give a man a dole and you save his body and destroy his spirit,"" he once said. ""Give him a job and you save both body and spirit."" And creating and giving work is what Hopkins did, on an extraordinary scale. In 1935, he became director of the Works Progress Administration (WPA), the best-loved and most imaginative of all the New Deal initiatives and one of the most important reasons Roosevelt won the 1936 and 1940 elections. For eight years, the WPA was the biggest employer in the USA, finding work for between 1.9 and 3.2 million people a month. At a time when one in four Americans was out of work, the WPA provided hope, dignity and a reasonable wage. It left an indelible mark - 650,000 miles of roads, streets and highways, 124,000 refurbished and freshly built bridges and more than 8,000 parks. Slums were cleared, airports built, sports stadiums renovated, electricity taken into the most remote village. There was a step change in the quality and quantity of the US infrastructure. Nor was that all. Under the ""Federal One"" projects, the WPA offered jobs to writers, actors, painters, journalists and musicians whose prospects had been devastated by the slump. Burt Lancaster and Orson Welles worked in the Federal Theatre Project, Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko in the Federal Art Project, Studs Terkel and Saul Bellow in the Federal Writers' Project. Musicians and actors laid on concerts and plays. The government became America's employer of last resort, underwriting its culture and infrastructure alike, in a country laid waste by a financial calamity and credit crunch. In 2009, Britain's economy is similarly stricken. The worst postwar recession was between 1979-81. Then, unemployment rose to 5.5% of the workforce and did not materially fall for eight years. The 2008-10 recession is more acute and the recovery is likely to be much more faltering, closer to the early 1930s. Top American economists Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff report that the average increase in unemployment after credit crunch-induced recessions is 7% of the workforce. If that happens, we can expect one in eight Britons to be unemployed by 2012. If the international outlook darkens or if the measures taken to put a floor under the economy do not work as they should, it could be much worse. Mass unemployment ranging up 4 million, with the young disproportionately affected, is going to be the story of the 2010s. It will be this July that the scale of what is happening will hit home: 600,000 young people will leave school and college looking for a job. As many as half may not get work. It is an unfolding social calamity. We know from the early 1980s that youth unemployment scars people psychologically, emotionally and economically and for life. People unemployed in their teens earn 12% to 15% less in their early forties. Harry Hopkins was right; work is fundamental to both body and spirit. There were great fears in the 1980s that unemployment would prompt unrest and protests, but the impact of generous redundancy packages and still solid unemployment benefit drew much of the sting. Today, there are already signs that people are going to be less compliant. They have heavier debts, the jobseeker's allowance is a paltry £60.50 a week and redundancy packages are meaner.  Moreover, this recession has been minted in the City by very rich and overpaid bankers. There is going to be a huge demand for fairness. The chief motive for the strike at the Total Lindsey oil refinery over foreign workers was the belief that British workers had been unfairly excluded from opportunity, something that has infinitely more resonance when jobs are insecure and new jobs increasingly hard to come by. There could easily be an ugly vendetta against bankers, foreigners and all things European. The government is keenly aware of the risks, hence the jobs summit last month. But the activism and ideas are out of kilter with the new reality. The Jobscentre Plus network, with counselling to help unemployed people back to work along with incentives to employers to take on new workers, is excellent, but it is predicated upon labour market buoyancy. There is a proposed national internship programme to help school and college leavers this June, but without compulsion on employers to participate, and serious funding, it will be swamped. Gordon Brown should immediately establish a British version of the Work Progress Administration to employ up to half a million people, to be engaged in the kind of projects Hopkins devised. In conditions like these, the state must become the employer of last resort. If wages were set at £300 per week, the direct net cost, after saving the jobseeker's allowance, would be around £6bn. Creating part-time work and internships for quarter of a million school and college leavers may cost another £1.5bn. And on top there would have to be funding to pay for the projects on which everyone worked. The total one-year cost could be as little as £20bn, less than has been spent recapitalising the Royal Bank of Scotland.  There will be objections that it is unaffordable, that a debt is being created for future generations and that the borrowing will crowd out private sector activity. With mass unemployment, there is no private sector activity to crowd out. The debt should be seen as an investment - in our people, in our infrastructure and in the avoidance of much misery. There is work to be done and a growing army of Britons who need to do it for their self-worth and living standards. Our generation could leave a transformed infrastructure and, maybe, a few British Jackson Pollocks and Saul Bellows. It would be the occasion for a collective effort that could unite us. For Labour, it would be an expression of what it believes in - deploying the state to create a fair society - and a powerful challenge to the Conservatives to back it as ""capitalism with a conscience"". Roosevelt cemented his political fortunes with the WPA in 1935. Gordon Brown could do the same in 2009.",Will Hutton: Britain needs a jobs programme to employ half a million people,2009-02-08T00:01:00Z,Will Hutton,politics
"India's hunger for the English language is manifested in the names of its schools. In Jaipur, the chief city of Rajasthan, under the letter B alone you can find the Blue Bells school, the Blue Birds school and the Bo-Peep school. Some don't sound so salubrious: the address of the Modern Happy school is listed as ""Behind Petrol Pump, Gapalpura Model Tank Road"". Many of them are likely to have been inspired more by profit than by educational ideals, their innocent nursery names disguising black-hearted entrepreneurs making a quick buck from Hindi-speaking parents who are anxious to promote their children into better jobs via familiarity with the world's most powerful language. It is easy to imagine an Indian variant of the kind of school satirised by Dickens and Waugh - schools born out of similar middle-class ambitions - in which a poorly-paid Miss Gupta chants the class through Wordsworth's Daffodils while dreaming in their inward eye of a couch in Bollywood rather than Windermere. The one I visited in Jaipur last month, however, seemed a model of commitment. This was the Step by Step school, one of a chain of fee-paying English-schools in north India, and I'd been invited to talk to the pupils about ""journalism, your life, those kinds of things"".  It was nine o'clock on a Saturday morning. A group of senior pupils aged about 16 sat cross-legged in neat rows, girls to the left and boys to the right, all in blue uniform. They remained completely silent through our on-stage conversation. Their questions, when they came at the end, were sharp and well-framed. Other memories of those 45 minutes are now a blur, save for two moments. One came when my hostess invited me to talk about nationalism and, perhaps a little too late, I realised I was being asked to proclaim its virtues rather than find fault with it as a political philosophy; ""national integration"" has always been an important project in a country of so many languages and creeds but the Mumbai attacks have installed a patriotic fervour against Pakistan of a kind Britain hasn't known since pictures of HMS Nelson were hung from the walls of Orwellian crammers.  The second arrived when in some headmaster-like spasm I talked to the audience about their future. They were a fortunate generation, I said. India and China were the new world powers, and India may in the end hold the advantage over its rival because of India's expressiveness in the English language, its democratic and more flexible governance and its long historical relationship with the west. ""You're lucky,"" I said. ""You were born at the right time in the right place. Seize the chance."" ""I especially appreciated those remarks,"" a teacher said later. ""It was good that you said them."" In fact, they may have been said rather jealously. That morning online I'd read the widely quoted remarks of the investor Jim Rogers, who made his original fortune in currency speculation when he founded the Quantum fund with George Soros. ""I would urge you to sell any sterling you might have,"" Rogers said. ""It's finished. I hate to say it, but I would not put any money into the UK.""  Alone in an Indian hotel room, aware of a bill that would show how the pound's value to the rupee had sunk over the past few months by 20%, it was perhaps too easy to feel depressed. Then again, all of Britain is depressed: a well of melancholy. In this week's Guardian, Max Hastings wrote the most chilling prognosis for a country softened and made greedy by decades of financial illusion, now facing a future of impoverishment and civil unrest. British workers would keep their wages ""only if they perform skilled tasks which others cannot, or provide their services for substantially smaller real rewards than they have received in the past"". The education system was a mess, producing young people ""fit only to be global losers"" when by contrast ""anyone who has met young Chinese and Indians of the new generation perceives their tigerish hunger, as well as their skills"". The last is true. Out of Step by Step, Bo-Peep - and for all I know the Modern Happy school, squatting behind the petrol pump - a different kind of Indian is emerging equipped with the individual aspiration traditionally associated with America, minus the brashness. Thirty years ago, when I first went to India, such people were rare and drawn either from the trading communities or the narrow seam known as the Anglophone elite. Now the middle-class has hugely expanded and believes rightly in its technical competence. If the age of territorial empires were to return in a process of reverse colonisation, Indians would be as perfectly or imperfectly equipped to run Yorkshire as the Britons in the Indian civil service once governed Bengal. As they may one day be happy to do, because the problems for India (and China) in the long term make those of Britain in the medium term look like molehills.  There was a time when I thought I would be happy to live, perhaps even die, in India. This may have been foolish romanticism, but it was easier then to ignore all the statistics in UN development reports; social inequality aside, their impact was located in the distant future. That future is much closer. Twice as many people live in India now as when I first saw it. By 2030, it will overtake China as the world's most populous country: between four and five times as many people as the United States now has, packed into a land only a third as large.  Those figures in themselves will bring intolerable pressure on the things we consider vital to a decent life - on land, water, crops and pleasure. Add the predicted effects of climate change, and the future of India and China as stable nations looks doubtful. The permanent snow cover on the Himalayas may not last beyond 2050; the Ganges, which provides 500 million people with water, draws more than two-thirds of its summer flow from the Himalayan meltwater that the snow and glaciers will no longer be there to supply. Then, of course, there is the likely influx of several million refugees from Bangladesh due to a rise in sea level.  All things considered, I was probably wrong to tell my Jaipur audience how lucky they were. Nowhere on earth, not even middle-class India, is this the ideal age to be born. The economic depression will do its worst. Britain may emerge as little more than a destination for educational and cultural tourists (pockets of violence are a danger, but so were brigands for gentleman making the ""Grand Tour""). But the much graver threat of unsustainable consumption and climate change will still tower over the world, and Britain may be a better place than many to face them. There will be copious water in the north and more root vegetables. In the long term, taking into account the Keynesian dismissal of that perspective (""we're all dead""), our grandchildren will stand a better chance here than by the dry bed of the Ganges. This offers one remote reason, admittedly an insular and inhumane one, to be cheerful.",Once I wanted to live and die in India. Not now,2009-02-07T00:01:00Z,Ian Jack,world
"One hesitates to dismiss Britain as a nation that knows the cost of everything and the value of nothing. But perhaps it isn't an enormous surprise that our children were recently judged some of the least happy in the developed world when, within 23 minutes of opening the curtains to reveal Monday's snowfall, we were being informed that this would all cost the UK economy £1.2bn.  Surveying nature's handiwork, it was hard not to feel past caring. Sling another billion on the fire, love - we've already torched a couple of hundred in the past month. At least we'll have snowmen and nice photos to show for this, as opposed to someone else's million-pound bonus.  Within the hour, the nation had picked a lane. Either you were playing in the snow, or you were ranting about our lack of hi-tech preparations for it. By now, the arguments against investing in fleets of snowploughs are so well worn as not to merit repetition, but can be basically summarised as: what is the point of having equipment that would only get a run-out every 18 years if it was lucky? It would be like buying Quasimodo a passion pad.  Unfortunately, we have since moved way beyond this spellbinding debate. The final straw came with the discovery that this week, 15,000 people called the emergency services complaining about snowball-throwing - 15,000! Who are these bleeding people? Does one know them socially? Clearly, they walk among us. But can't they sod off and eat the yellow snow? Meanwhile, yet another few thousand calls to the BBC mount up, so it seems timely to ask: how much does complaining cost the UK economy? All those people, presumably taking time out from work to get angry about countless perceived injustices. This isn't to suggest there's a moral equivalence between their complaints - my sincere sympathies lie with Everton fans infuriated that their match-winning goal appeared to be subject to an ITV D-notice, while the ""I loved my golliwog as a child"" brigade tug rather less strongly on the old heartstrings. But what is the cost in productivity of this ceaseless outrage?  Gambolling into the virgin snow of service journalism, I call the Federation of Small Businesses, who are good enough to help with such inquiries. (And, please, never forget it's joyless hacks asking them how much snow costs the economy, as opposed to the federation volunteering the information just to slush on everyone's parade.) Stephen Alambritis, the federation's head of public affairs, is a chap who knows the cost of most things but is decent enough to be aware of their value. He sighs that, after a tube driver had jokingly announced ""next time you might want to wait until the doors are open before getting on the train"", London Underground was deluged with complaints. Well done, everybody. Rather more importantly, he tells me that the infrastructure designed to deal with complaints costs the UK economy about £1bn a year - and then of course those complaints need to be serviced.  We can only guess at the strain this system was placed under during the past week, what with the killer snowballs and Carol Thatcher and so on, and indeed the resultant spike in cost to UK plc. However, Stephen does mention that a bank holiday costs the economy £6bn, so perhaps those who got so exercised about their own lost productivity could volunteer to forgo the next one in lieu?  There's a great episode of The Simpsons when Homer gets on Springfield's A-list, and ends up meeting various lefty, tree-hugging celebrities, one of whom drives an unconventional vehicle. ""It's a go-cart,"" he explains, ""powered by my own sense of self-satisfaction."" Whatever we're powering with our sense of permanent outrage, it isn't the economy. (That said, I am given to understand the tendency is fairly helpful to the Guardian's economy, so all those who set down their work to post furious comments beneath complaining articles like this very one are obviously thanked for keeping us in lentils and sandals for another fortnight.) As for our real-life celebrities, it's not often I find myself agreeing with one of their brothers, but on Thursday's Question Time, Will Young quoted his twin remarking how lovely it was that the snow had shown people ""could unite over something other than fear"".  Part of Adam Curtis's thesis in his brilliant documentary series The Power of Nightmares is that if you can convince people they are threatened by a highly organised malevolent entity, they become pliant and unquestioning. Perhaps the government should work to convince us that some phantom menace's superpower is controlling the weather. That was the thing in Gotham City, of course - if ever it got a bit perishing, it could all be blamed on Mr Freeze; and instead of spending their afternoons ranting to some complaint line about it, the citizens could just unite in fear and hope Batman would sort it out. Failing that, let us wish for a blanket of snow in the old style, that will shut down communications like it did in decades gone by and cut the moaners off at the pass. It's all pointless anyway. Weather happens, tube drivers occasionally crack jokes, and Mark Thompson will probably mismanage the BBC into the ground with or without your complaints, messages of support, or whines about snowballs.  marina.hyde@theguardian.com",Marina Hyde: Let it snow on our nation of the permanently outraged,2009-02-07T00:01:00Z,Marina Hyde,uk
"Ah, Davos. We'll always have Davos. Economies may fail, banking systems may collapse, but we'll always have Davos, late capitalism's annual attempt to recreate the experience of what it would be like to spend eternity in hell's most ghastly private members' club. It isn't difficult to identify this year's greatest disappointment. My tears could not quite liquefy at news that one of the important and effective après-ski sessions - Meet the Peacemakers, starring Middle East envoy Tony Blair - had understandably vanished from the programme. Nor could I muster anguish that the no-shows had taken the fun out of the usual status-jockeying over how nice the hotel room you've been allocated is. You know why you have a larger bathroom this year, my generic chief executive? Because Bernie Madoff couldn't make it. Everyone's been bumped up. On the offchance a federal judge hasn't required you to surrender your passport by next year, you might even score a junior suite with mountain view.  No, what really got the bottom lip quivering was news that, this year, the Davos goody bags are much depleted. As a keen collector of answers to the question ""How screwed is our world?"", I am thrilled to discover that there are bleeding goody bags at the World Economic Forum. Do they give out free iPods at the UN security council? It would complete my set. Perhaps the disappointing goody bags are directly related to the lack of celebrities at Davos this time round. In recent years, of course, the gathering has teemed with stars, observers reporting even finance ministers stalking them with cameraphones and generally acting like teenage girls at a Justin Timberlake concert. In 2005, one celebrity wrangler said she'd brought along Sharon Stone because Davos was where one mixed ""issue-driven stars with serious CEOs"". Sharon Stone is ""issue-driven""? That's one way of putting it, though ""walking liability"" is marginally more accurate. Be it her excruciating joint press conference with Shimon Peres - ""I would kiss just about anybody for peace in the Middle East!"" - or her calamitous interventions that very year at Davos, when she managed to cock up an entire fundraising drive, Sharon certainly has issues. She isn't in Switzerland now. Nor are fellow regulars Brad and Angelina. Easily the most glaring absence, though, is Bono, whose publicist explains he is ""finishing an album"" - and I suppose everyone has to pay the tax man. Actually, that's not strictly true. Bono only has to pay a few per cent tax, because he shifted U2's music publishing company to the Netherlands. He's spent the past few Davos gatherings badgering governments about progress on the UN's millennium development goals. Fun fact: the Tax Justice Network estimates that if tax was paid on the money the world's rich have protected in tax havens, it would raise $255bn - enough to finance the millennium development goals five times over.  Still, that's showbiz. But one has to ask: where is the Bono of the global financial crisis? Where is the entertainer who, quite unbidden, will lead us out of the woods toward a better tomorrow - all the while bravely refusing to compromise their ineffable cool by removing their sunglasses? Where is the tax exile of stage or screen who will be given space on the White House lawn to inform the world that this won't stand? After all, the lesson of the past few years in celebrity has been that there is no problem in the world too complex that it cannot be addressed by the emotionalised, platitudinous pronunciations of an entertainer.  If you ever want to measure precisely how little of a toss we give about Africa, just consider that the UN's answer to the crisis in sub-Saharan maternal healthcare is Ms Geri Halliwell. The erstwhile Ginger Spice is the UN goodwill ambassador tasked with this vaguely complicated area, and last year they packed her off to Washington, dressed as Jackie Kennedy, to give congressmen the benefit of her considerable expertise. I'd like to think that had the great economic illusion managed to preserve itself just a little longer, Geri would have been doing the rounds of Davos this year, chewing off Bill Gates's ear about ""the hope in the children's eyes"" when they saw her. Also last year, the UN sent Angelina Jolie to Iraq to officially advise on the displacement of two million people. Can't we rustle up someone similar to break off from making $20m a picture for a few afternoons a year and come up with a roadmap out of this financial meltdown? Isn't riding to the rescue where governments have failed the celebrity's stock in trade?  So good luck, entertainers. It falls to at least one of you to come forward with some plan sketched out on a dressing room napkin, which you will use to circumvent normal legislative channels, to bellow at people who've paid to see your concerts, and to trot out in every interview to layer gravitas on your latest shoot-'em up movie.

"A secret is what you tell one person at a time. A state secret is a newspaper. For the past 10 years journalists have been able to find out almost anything about government by just asking, under the Freedom of Information Act 2000. Or if they prefer, they can wait and find it out 30 years later. This is mad. Yesterday a committee appointed by Gordon Brown under his alter ego, Paul Dacre of the Daily Mail, put its head to one side and then the other, counted to 10, and opted for cutting the madness in half. If newspapers did not want to know something right away, they should jolly well have to wait 15 years to do so. Aha, cried the March Hare, got you there. Alice asked for less tea and the dormouse fell asleep. Sometimes you cannot fault the British. The report, written by Dacre himself, the historian Sir David Cannadine, and the mandarin Sir Joseph Pilling, is crisp and impossible to query. It declares a liberal presumption in favour of open government. It assembles historical and contemporary evidence and concludes that 15 years beats 30. There is no Blairite waffle of the sort that renders most public documents nowadays unreadable, just a deposition of question and answer in clear, crisp English. People today are ever more sceptical of those who govern them and take their money, especially when there are now some 100,000 public bodies, all more intrusive than ever. Indeed it is a paradox of modern politics that the more openness we demand, the more we deplore intrusion. We want to know everything about everyone, except ourselves. The report sees dangers in the ""let it all hang out"" school of openness. We can gleefully rejoice in the embarrassment of MPs' expenses and rage over sums squandered on ministerial flights. But each attempt to disclose the daily intimacies of government pushes decisions ever further from public view into the private cabals of so-called ""sofa government"". The concept of a formal, recorded Whitehall meeting collapsed under Tony Blair. His failure to minute his often explosive ""bilaterals"" with Gordon Brown left officials despairing and the cabinet secretary, Lord Butler, pleading that ""blood is thicker than water"". No serious observer could argue that government has become more decisive, more efficient or cheaper as a result of freedom of information. Openness appears to have neutered official impartiality and politicised advice. Ministers have become more, not less, terrified of taking decisions - witness nuclear power or drug law reform. The report takes this seriously. It cites FoI as having damaged ""safe space"", where ministers and officials can argue policies with full candour, knowing their words are secret. All organisations and their leaders need such space to make coherent, sometimes unpopular, decisions. Some animals do have to be more equal than others. The resulting impact on Whitehall, claims the report, has been a ""lack of full documentation ... absence of appropriate officials and ministers at meetings ... failure to keep full records and accurate minutes ... and decisions taken in this way with no real debate or serious discussion"". These are serious charges to lay at the door of openness, which probably should be the subject of a different inquiry into the conduct of state business. As a result, the Dacre committee reached the conclusion that immediate disclosure - thrusting all information straight into the public domain - would not be wise. It would not just upset individuals and foreign governments, it ""would lead to reduced frankness between ministers and civil servants, and that would make it impossible to sustain the important practice of collective cabinet responsibility"". Last year's accidental of draft Treasury ideas on taxation demonstrated the idiocy that can enter debate as a result of premature disclosure. Most public bodies already put a mass of material on the web. The annual budget now generates more than 300 pages of supporting material. Meanwhile formal cabinet minutes rarely contain any substance, let alone the whole truth. Immediate openness would lead either to chaos or a slapdash ""BlackBerrying"" of debate. For all this, the report argues that greater openness renders power more accountable. We know more - vastly more - about how we are governed, and that knowledge is the rootstock of consent. This has not diminished ministers' capacity to lie and cheat, but we do not have to wait 30 years to realise it. We already know that the Iraq invasion was mendacious, that parliamentarians have snouts in the trough, and that the Olympic budget is a dog's breakfast of extravagance. The question is which of the 20% of requests under FoI that are refused are of real democratic importance. Few are likely to be of real help to citizens in forming a balanced judgment of policy. The records will not say who leaned on the attorney general over Iraq in 2003, or what meetings, donations or perks influenced decisions on third runways, defence contracts or renewable energy subsidies. Such matters tend to be buried not in civil service memorandums or minutes, but in lunches between old chums, weekend retreats, offers of present or future jobs, and airline upgrades. This material is more likely to be available from interviews and from the memoirs and diaries of ex-ministers, ambassadors, spymasters (and mistresses) and press officers. The report calculates that the length of time it takes for a retiring public servant to get his or her memoirs into print is now an average of one-and-a-half years. For some we need a taste editor rather than a 15-year rule. The chief barrier to wider information today is probably the indolence of reporters rather than some official secrecy. Equally, it is hard to imagine much serious material still lurking amid the welter of public documentation that merits the prolonged secrecy of a national archive. The best argument for any rule is to relieve public figures of the need constantly to haggle over their past deeds when they are still struggling with their present ones. In which case 15 years seems long enough. There are exemptions anyway for what really needs to be kept secret. Harold Wilson's case for reducing the previous 50-year delay to 30 was simply one of time: that if historians were to criticise him, ""I would rather be alive to answer them"". Every man should have a right to draft, or at least protest, his own obituary. We should not leave it too long for those involved in public affairs to confront their past. A decade and a half is beyond the span of most administrations and most ministerial careers, and thus offers a dignified lapse for reassessment. If FoI, published diaries, revelations and memoirs can deliver the first rough draft of history, the 15-year rule can permit the second. It is still a little mad, but so is common sense. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com",Simon Jenkins: For real secrets we already have the one-and-a-half-year memoir rule,2009-01-30T00:01:00Z,Simon Jenkins,politics
"If I were a hereditary peer - the Earl of Farringdon, perhaps - then I know what my first reaction would have been to the Sunday Times revelations that four members of the House of Lords were prepared to sell their lawmaking powers. I'd have concluded that banishing the bluebloods from Westminster had been a terrible mistake. After all, back in the days when only viscounts and earls were allowed into the second chamber, when it truly was an upper house, there would have been no risk of such squalid scandal. Aristocrats, cushioned by their private income, would have waved aside the offer of a paltry £120,000 per annum as barely enough cash to polish the family silver. These days those ancient defences against corruption have, alas, been washed away. That talkative quartet have no inherited fortune to fall back on, so they are, it seems, easy prey for the lure of lucre. What is the simplest answer? Why, bring back the hereditaries of course - ideally in a fleet of horse-drawn carriages. Luckily no one is suggesting that. The more rational reaction is to understand what the Chartists understood nearly 200 years ago, when one of their key democratic demands was pay for members of parliament. Without it, only the wealthiest could afford to sit in Westminster. Emerging democracies, fighting corruption, still learn the related lesson to this day: that unless they are paid, legislators will be all too susceptible to bribery. These are basic truths, and yet they are not implemented in one half of our legislature. Peers receive a daily attendance fee of £330, but still no annual salary. Nor do they have any of the other essentials of a modern, functioning legislature: no office space, no administrative backup. Instead the second chamber still operates on 19th-century lines, bound together by gentlemanly conventions and revelling in its non-professional status, as if its very amateurishness were a badge of distinction. The message is clear: go to the Commons if you want party discipline, broadband connections, secretaries and all that dull paraphernalia of modernity and efficiency; we are the repository of ancient wisdom, lovable eccentricity and free thinking. But the Sunday Times story has exposed all that as a bit of a con. Yes, there may be the odd speech with a sagacity one would rarely hear in the Commons; appearances by Robert Winston, Martin Rees and Onora O'Neill give the place class. But they are not the folk doing most of the day-to-day business. The inadvertent testimony of Lords Moonie, Truscott, Snape and Taylor makes clear that the second chamber is, in fact, as full of hacks as the first. Traditional defenders of the upper house tend to argue that it is not only wiser and more mature than the Commons - an argument rehearsed on these pages today by the leader of the Lords, Baroness Royall - but that it is one step removed from the governance of the country. It is only a ""revising chamber""; the Commons retains ""primacy"". But while technically true, this can be misleading - and self-serving. It adds to the impression that those in ermine belong somehow to what Bagehot called the dignified part of our constitution, that the Lords is more about tradition than the business of passing laws. Once again, these latest revelations explode that myth. We can see that the second chamber is up to its elbows in the detailed nitty-gritty of lawmaking. The phrase ""revising chamber"" suggests a lordly eye cast over Commons bills, ensuring the i's are dotted and t's crossed. But our garrulous quartet have confirmed that ""revising"" is no lofty exercise in mere scrutiny. The Lords can shove in amendments that make substantive differences to the law of the land. With all the horsetrading that goes on in the Lords, where no party has a permanent majority, it is, as Lord Truscott admitted, ""easier to amend things here"". Once sent back to the Commons, time pressure means MPs don't always reopen these bills for yet further debate. So the Lords' changes become law. This is the worst of both worlds. All the power, and temptation that goes with it, of a legislature, but with few of the safeguards - and all hidden behind a convenient veil of tradition, amateurishness and apparently incorruptibly independent wisdom. As for remedy, there are two possible approaches: incremental or big bang. The former would seek to iron out the most obvious anomalies, ending the incredible rule that allows even a convicted perjurer like Jeffrey Archer to keep his seat in the Lords. Right now the worst that can happen to a law-breaking peer is that he be made to say sorry. The chamber should move into line with the Commons and start suspending or expelling those who do wrong. While they're at it, they could simply import the full set of rules that the Commons devised after the Tory sleaze revelations of the 1990s. Those Nolan standards - including an obligation to declare all outside earnings, stating the precise amounts of cash involved - have been pretty effective. Why should they only apply to one half of the legislature? The other route is wholesale reform. It starts from a premise that the entire Lords edifice is built on a laugh-out-loud absurdity: that the nation's laws are still being co-authored by people who the nation does not choose. An unelected legislature should be an oxymoron in a democracy, and yet that is what, in part, we still have. It should be replaced by a slimmed-down second chamber - not the ludicrous 750-member club we have now - made up of well-resourced, paid and elected legislators. Judged solely on principle, there should be no contest over which is the right path. But principle is never the sole consideration. There is another: which has the better chance for success? The gradualists have a powerful case. They note that the Lords remains such an embarrassment partly because successive attempts at modest reform have been shot down by those demanding wholesale change. The trouble, says Meg Russell, an expert on the issue at UCL's constitution unit, is that this ""big bang reform never happens"". She used to work for Robin Cook when he was in charge of Lords reform: he was the cleverest man in politics, she says, and even he couldn't get it done. The result is that flaws in the Lords remain uncorrected, damaging the reputation of parliament and politics year after year. Better, says Russell, to take what small steps you can. She points to the Parliament Act of 1911, the Life Peerages Act of 1958 and the eviction of the hereditaries in 1999: all were rubbished by radicals at the time as minor tinkering: ""Yet these are the things which succeed."" It is a compelling argument, and it may turn out to be the best we can do. And yet, with the curtain on the Lords now so vigorously pulled back, its reality exposed, surely the government could impose its will. The Commons has voted for a fully elected second chamber already, back in 2007. Now all Labour need do is act on it. Yes, that will mean facing down the Lords, but there will hardly be a better time to do it than now, when the upper house's old tunes about tradition and wisdom ring so hollow. The alternative is to believe that we are somehow incapable of change, that a problem Britain has debated for 150 years will remain unsolved for another 150. Surely we are better than that. freedland@theguardian.com",Jonathan Freedland: It is surely time for Lords reform,2009-01-28T00:01:00Z,Jonathan Freedland,politics
"The British government will do anything, absolutely anything, to avoid boosting demand in the recession. Yesterday's frantic rescue package for the car industry will boost profits (or reduce losses) but not sell a single extra car. As for the steelworkers of Llanwern, on whom such sales depend, the policy can only be to retrain them as hedge fund managers. Billions in subsidy is now rescuing hedge fund managers, nothing to rescue steel. Ever since Alistair Darling hired a posse of City bankers to advise him on recession, they have recommended that he give money unconditionally to banks. As the Titanic sinks, they cry that he cannot let bankers drown. They are our friends. Let steelworkers sink, but keep the boats for the bankers. I wonder what advice Darling would have received if he had ennobled a dozen steelworkers and asked them to sit in the Treasury. He might protest that they would merely tell him to save the steel industry. But at least steelworkers would have gone out and spent. Bankers have hightailed it to Monaco. Since nobody has a clue as to what is happening to the economy, we might as well return to first principles. The Llanwern worker makes steel mostly for three consumer industries: cars, white goods and buildings. His job depends not on the viability of some distant bank, but on the public buying his product. The only sensible way to keep this man in work is to ensure that the public keeps buying. All else is smoke and mirrors. Beg people to buy, lend them to spend, give them vouchers, cash, anything to keep them in the marketplace for goods and services. All else is delay and a waste of effort. The Brown-Darling policy is archaeo-Thatcherism. It is to regard the steelworker as a residuum of an economic downturn. The government has decided to aid not Corus, but Corus's bank. It has hurled money at banks in the vague hope that some might stick to Corus and thus to its workers. Without demand this is pointless. No bank lends to a bankrupt foundry. What the banks are doing instead is using the money for something they regard as worthwhile, covering the debts outstanding on their balance sheets. Some of these are from poor home-owners, recklessly induced to buy by Gordon Brown and Yvette Cooper. But most were run up during the wildest speculative bubble known to economics, the buying and selling of financial derivatives. Dutch tulip futures were at least about tulips. Today's debts are a pyramid of promissory notes at the base of which lies next to nothing, the so-called toxic paper. This pyramid of bankruptcy should have been collapsed long before anyone collapsed Llanwern. The regulators could have dismantled it after the rescue of the first casualty, Northern Rock, in 2007, but they were asleep. They (or their US brethren) might have done so again by rescuing Lehman Brothers and thus underpinning credit last summer. When the system unravelled in September the only sensible path was to acknowledge that the banks were bankrupt. Retail banks owe their proclaimed special status - their access to Treasury funds - to their ability to lend, to their credit. Without that credit, and unable to lend, they are a waste of space. Sir Fred Goodwin's RBS is now no more entitled to taxpayer subsidy than a used-car dealer on the North Circular. When trucks loaded with Darling's loot arrived at the Square Mile, the banks should have been properly nationalised. Depositors' balances should have been protected to keep the cash machines working. Bank shares, assets and liabilities would have gone into administration and managers would have become government agents, lending guaranteed loans to businesses on public credit. This is now being done, but three months too late to save hundreds of thousands of jobs. Instead some £85bn of public money, the biggest state gusher in peacetime, has vanished into relieving the debts of private financiers. But inevitably not enough. This has brought down the lending banks and dried up credit. Recession has duly ensued. There is no mystery here. It is in the textbooks. On the outbreak of the Great War, the City of London pleaded to be left to continue normal business with Germany, lest its worldwide credit be damaged. The chancellor, Lloyd George, said that Britain was at war and the City would do as it was told. Every interest rate and every loan was put under state direction. Banks were ordered to buy government stock and lend money according to a state capital issues committee. ""We are Treasury-ridden,"" they howled. But they obeyed and the war was won. The story of this saga by the City historian David Kynaston tells of the utter selfishness of bankers and the confident command of Lloyd George. Faith in him, even in the City, became so total that, when he mooted moving to 10 Downing Street, the governor of the Bank of England interrupted the great man shaving and burst into tears. Such loyalty is inconceivable today. Stupefying amounts of taxpayers' money have been given to banks, and with no conditions attached. It has been nationalisation without responsibility, nationalisation as charity. If local councillors had behaved like Darling and Brown, they would have been arrested and surcharged. They have given favours to their friends. They are the Shirley Porters of New Labour. The latest gimmick is to lend money to car companies to innovate and ""be green"". How it is green to carpet the countryside with thousands of unsold cars is not explained. The Germans are doing the right thing. They are issuing vouchers to people to spend on German-made cars. The money goes straight from the consumer to the producer, thus keeping the dealer, the factory and the steelworker in business. None of it sticks to a bank. The same could be done across the economic piece. There is no other way of keeping in business the 2,500 laid-off Corus workers of south Wales, the 2,500 Philips electronics workers, the shopkeepers, drivers, waiters and hairdressers, on all of whose incomes recovery depends. Only revived demand will do that. Instead Darling and Brown (with full Tory support) are systematically depressing the economy.

"For promoting ""chav-free"" holidays, travel company Activities Abroad has caused - well, controversy is too lofty a word. It is something between a kerfuffle and a furore. A kurore. I'm going to set up my own travel company and call it that. It will feature villa-style accommodation, with an organised two-hour argument at every meal. At the end, the designated host will spray everyone with a hose. It sent an email to 24,000 clients, promising that on its holidays, you wouldn't meet anyone called ""Britney, Dazza, Chardonnay and Candice"". I mean, as sneering goes, it lacks the accuracy to wound. In fact you'd love to meet a Britney, because you'd either be in Australia or it would be the actual Britney, and you'd be somewhere really fancy.  I have always thought there was something dodgy about people who liked going on adventure holidays. I am not opposed to the fact of being active - I simply have the following prejudices: snow sports attract snobs and try-hards; gap-style, volunteery, ""environmental"" breaks attract people who want to tell the rest of the world how little to fly while reserving the right to do exactly as they please in Guatemala; and water sports attract people who want to show you slides of water sports.  These are all variants of snobbery, apart from the water, so I am not at all surprised by the faux pas made by Activities Abroad. I am not surprised by the strength of the response either, given the phrasing of the email (""Are there names you are likely to encounter or not encounter on an Activities Abroad holiday? ... Likely: John, Sarah, James, Charles, Rachel, Michael, Alice, Lucy, Joseph, Charlotte. Nuff said, innit?"") God help me, it's like brown-water rafting through the shit-storm of their psyche.  I am somewhat surprised by the company founder's attempts to defend himself. Alistair (there's fancy) McLean, said: ""I am genuinely sorry if our newsletter caused offence. However, I simply feel it is time the middle classes stood up for themselves. We work hard to make a decent home and life for our families ... Unfortunately, everyone else in our society seems to take from us, whether it is incompetent bankers or the shell-suited urchins who haunt our street corners."" Incompetent bankers called what, exactly? Ptolemy? And shell-suited urchins haunting us how, precisely? By calling their children Britney? Oh, the spectre of the made-up name, with no distinction or pedigree. The very thought of it spoils my Bavarian dinghy-break.  This is not the first time a holiday company has attracted criticism for repugnant views. There was trouble over Sandals, with its ""straight couples only"" rule. Ken Livingstone (who seems wiser and fairer the more politically dead he is; like Solomon) led the charge, banning its ads on the tube in 2003. Other firms took a more cash-first approach, and there was considerable internal pressure within IPC, among others, where magazines continued to carry the ads despite their laughable prejudice. Sandals, in its defence, cited laws against homosexuality in some destinations, but this seems insufficient grounds for overturning two generations of civil rights progress. Sandals abandoned the idea in 2004, a heart-warming testament to how disapprobation can turn tides, even when among people who wouldn't be seen dead in one of your resorts in the first place.  But the anomaly remains. In a world where stirring up the mildest controversy is taken to be as commercially useful as setting fire to tenners, holiday operators seem to think the gloves are off. ""It's their holiday, goddammit,"" say their marketing bucks. ""Surely they slough off the po-faced liberalism for two weeks a year? Not even Guardian readers can keep it up all the time."" Matey, I'm afraid we can. We don't even take August off.  mszoewilliams@yahoo.co.uk",Zoe Williams: Holiday with the hoorays,2009-01-28T00:01:00Z,Zoe Williams,society
"The fact that you are reading this newspaper suggests you are pretty concerned about the country you're living in. The economic news gets unrelentingly worse. The government's attempts on Monday to help the banking system further went down spectacularly badly. The pound has fallen another 6% in just five days. Unemployment rose by nearly 80,000 in December. And after figures showing a 1.5% decline in output in the last three months of 2008, economists are talking about a depression rather than recession. It is not good. You are right to be worried. Right to be incandescent about the arrogant financial bosses who got us into this mess. And right to be angry about the politicians, regulators and right-wing intellectuals who indulged the whole process with their worship of the canons of free market fundamentalism. Remain balanced. There is a lot of economic pain ahead and many risks - we could yet see wholesale nationalisation of the banks and Britain being forced to negotiate a jumbo international loan before the story is over - but already powerful forces that will reverse the decline are being unleashed. We can expect GDP to fall by at least 5% over two years, the average depth and length of recessions caused by financial crises, according to the IMF. But ultra-low interest rates, the biggest devaluation for a century, the government's willingness to underwrite the banking system, reflate and print money will avert a full-blooded depression. There will be economic life in the years after 2011. Moreover, everybody has learnt salutary lessons about how to do capitalism. In future, it will have to be fairer, more balanced, more closely governed at home and abroad - and slower. The City, spreading a virus that for generations has obstructed a fair society and productive, high-investment economy, has at last been dislodged. Britain will be the better for it. The government takes a lot of hits and rightly; Gordon Brown's mantra of no boom and bust, always a hostage to fortune, will haunt him to his grave. He did more than his fair share of genuflecting to the now-fallen gods of finance, ""light touch"" regulation and free markets. However, since the autumn, I have been impressed by the way the government has tried to address the crisis. It was too slow for too long in coming to terms with the depths of its own and the financial system's mistakes. But the remarks by City minister Lord Myners about how over-rewarded bankers had no understanding of the society around them leave little doubt they comprehend now. Monday's attempt to help the banks was unfairly criticised. A package with a price tag of up to £300bn is not a half-measure, as Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg complained. And shadow chancellor George Osborne's call for the government to come clean about the risk it was assuming completely missed the point. Nobody knows the extent of bad and toxic debt on the banks' balance sheets, least of all the banks.  One option is to create a ""bad bank"" that warehouses the debt courtesy of the taxpayer, but the process is expensive, slow and invites questions of how the debt is to be valued. The proposed asset protection scheme is cleverer. It works more like car or house insurance; the bank accepts the first 5% or 10% of loss on the bad debt and then insures against the rest. The faster and more accurately the bank assesses the risk and then insures it, the better off it - and the system - will be. There are further positive measures. The government will guarantee any new issues of asset-backed securities, the packaged-up mortgages and suchlike that can be bought and sold, to get finance flowing again. It will even have the Bank of England buy them. This should allow home buyers to get mortgages again. It falls short of the mobilisation that James Crosby called for in his report on mortgage finance, but it has the advantage of extending credit to companies that cannot refinance their debts. It also allows the Bank, when it buys the securities, effectively to print money, a crucial breakthrough. I like what the package tries to do and have been urging something along these lines for months. Together with the recapitalisation of last autumn, there is a good chance of putting the UK banks back on their feet. That doesn't mean we are out of the woods. Will Barclays, for example, and even HSBC get through this without needing taxpayer investment? I doubt it. But the government should resist calls for wholesale nationalisation, except in an emergency. The issue is exercising the control it already has. It is amazing, for example, that the non-executive directors of RBS, surely the weakest of any company in history, are still in place. I hope Lord Myners will start cleaning out the stables. If there is spare cash, it should be spent on building up capacity elsewhere in the banking system. Foreign banks, which used to be responsible for a third of the lending in Britain, have fled; they need to be replaced. One of the less remarked aspects of last Monday was the decision to allow Northern Rock to run itself down more slowly. The government should go further. Northern Rock should be the government housing bank. It should be joined by a new national infrastructure bank and even a long-term industrial investment bank. Rather like Roosevelt in the 1930s, New Labour must build a network of new banks and new lending capacity. The European Commission, if it tries to block this new banking infrastructure because - potentially - it breaks state aid rules, should be challenged over what it proposes instead. Sadly, none of this is going to avert another 18 months of declining GDP and unemployment rising by at least a million. But the government is putting a floor under the economy. It would have an even better chance if its measures were both part of an international effort and clearly led to a different kind of capitalism, less dependent on reckless bankers and property bubbles. One of the banks' problems is that they are not trusted and do not trust each other. There needs to be an international effort to create simple clearing banks by outlawing the ability to mix commercial and so-called ""investment"" banking. Betting our cash for personal gain should be outlawed. So far, there is not a whisper. Nor is there any conversation about how bank bailouts would work better if they were internationally co-ordinated and funded, which is of huge importance to our very exposed Britain. Instead, banks everywhere are retreating to their own backyards.  Nor is there much creative thinking about what kind of economy we should build for the decades ahead. Our companies have chased after too high returns for too long and undervalued innovation and production. We need to use this once-in-50-year opportunity to recast the entire framework in which companies are organised, governed and financed - and the new banks should be part of the new settlement.  In the past, when I proposed ideas like these, I have been told they were politically and economically impossible. Now they are an imperative. The government was rewarded for its decisiveness last autumn with an opinion poll jump. To regain the momentum, now it has to focus on the wider economic and political story. It is not. And we and it are paying the price.","Will Hutton: Yes it's bad, but at long last the government is getting it right",2009-01-25T00:01:00Z,Will Hutton,politics
"Just before Christmas, I interviewed Kenneth Clarke in his Westminster office. In retrospect, his negotiations with his party's leadership must have been well under way, though that afternoon, he dutifully went through his paces as Ken The Booming Backbencher. There was at least one off-message warning to his colleagues: ""Anybody who stands at the next election on a platform of tax cuts is asking for trouble""), and a conversational style that mixed insouciance with strident self-belief. The experience, needless to say, was quite unlike that of interviewing most younger politicians, as decisively proved by two things: the complete absence of the usual flim-flam about ""moving forward"" and the like, and his small talk - stuff about the jazz sax player John Coltrane, Clarke's fondness for wearing braces, and a favourite restaurant called the Pimlico Tandoori. Such is part of the explanation for his return, mixed up with the non-metropolitan whiff of his beloved East Midlands - and, most important, his years of government experience. One killer fact sums up not just the benefits of Clarke's CV, but its incongruity: as the BBC's Nick Robinson pointed out when the news broke, he has been an MP longer than George Osborne has been alive.  After the comeback of Peter Mandelson, the partial return of Alan Milburn, and rumoured recalls for David Blunkett and Charles Clarke (it would be nice to include Margaret Beckett, though her low profile thus far as housing minister says a lot about the pitiful underplaying of that issue), what the renaissance of the Big Beasts means is obvious enough. Gordon Brown's skin-saving claim at Labour's last conference that this is ""no time for a novice"" spoke a much wider truth: as also proved by the ubiquity of the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, Vince Cable, in such dangerous times, the public requires more than the focus-grouped assurances of people whose memories date back little further than the 1980s. Even if most of your experience is of the Westminster game, knowledge, candour, and the cool self-assurance that often arrives after half a century are no longer to be underestimated.  And what a turnabout this is. Do not forget: when Gordon Brown took over the Labour leadership, there was a lot of talk about the elevation of a generation who would couch the government in a crucial sense of renewal and vitality: the two Milibands, James Purnell, Ed Balls, Yvette Cooper, Andy Burnham. The toppling of Ming Campbell and his replacement by Nick Clegg was part of the same wave. The odd voice wondered whether the talking-up of politicians with such flimsy back stories was wise but no one much listened.  At Westminster, even if there are formidable beasts still waiting on the backbenches, it feels like the reverse now applies, and being wise and battle-scarred is the ""in"" thing. If you want a neat crystallisation of the new mood, think back to two Labour stories from last week: Shriti Vadera's blunder over supposed ""green shoots"", and Mandelson's ever-so-slightly patronising smoothing-over later that day (Would she say anything like it again? ""I doubt it,"" he smiled, with a kind of avuncular menace); and that image of David Miliband inspecting his rustic accommodation in India - presumably an attempt at worldliness that ended up looking like something from a gap year. And so to the tangled-up politics of all this. Essentially, Clarke has been brought back to develop the charge that Labour has destroyed the economy he restored to health. He has dutifully checked in his Europhilia, but you have to wonder about the contortions he would undergo if the Tories got to deliver their promised referendum on the Lisbon treaty. In general terms, he and his younger colleagues are on the same page when it comes to the public finances, though his antipathy to tax cuts may yet jangle their nerves. Right now, if his return tells you anything, it's that Cameron and Osborne remain adaptable shape-shifters, who could doubtless bring back such right-leaning veterans as David Davis and Iain Duncan Smith - both tipped for the call-up of late - with just as much assurance. In Labour's case, last week's Heathrow decision suggested that the downturn has revealed the government's more middle-aged figures as representatives of a surprisingly old Labour tradition: the values-light Labourism one can trace back to the likes of Ernest Bevin, whereby what really matter are jobs and security, and fretting about the environment is the stuff of bourgeois indulgence. Reported tensions between Mandelson and the climate change secretary Ed Miliband may well say a lot about what could erupt after the next election - when internal Labour feuding may not be about such old chestnuts as public service reform, but a standoff between one generation who think everything must start with sustainability, and another who hold fast to the social democracy of smokestacks and airports.  All that aside, Britain's increasingly aged political activists may now be looking to the next election, and feeling jittery about the usual slew of hotshot candidates with precious little behind them aside from research and lobbying jobs. If I was an aspiring politician in my 40s or 50s who had never got the breaks, I might be eyeing the general election of 2014 and thinking that my time may yet come. The generation recently talked up as the imminent inheritors of the earth, meanwhile, should be feeling uneasy. Some of their tribes' elders - jazz, curry, braces and all - are going to be around for rather longer than expected. john.harris@theguardian.com",John Harris: Battle scars are back in vogue with the Big Beasts' revival,2009-01-21T00:01:00Z,John Harris,politics
"Either Gordon Brown is mad or I am. His obsession with bankers has become that of an infatuated teenager. He loves them and loathes them. They taunt and tease him, and he pouts and begs and cries and loses his temper. His body craves them, but each day finds him furiously beating their chests with his fists. They have their way with him and walk away. He should forget them all and go back to his GCSE economics paper. Brown's recession policy is now to take unlimited sums from Britons' current and future spending and give to bankers, notably the Royal Bank of Scotland once run by his old Glasgow chum, Sir Fred Goodwin. This is daft, since banks naturally use the money for the one thing government should avoid in a recession. They protect their balance sheets by writing off bad debts. Taxpayers' money is thus withdrawn from the economy and saved - a disaster. The impact of policy is blatantly deflationary. The opposite of Keynesian tax and spend, it is tax and save. Yet every senior politician and economic commentator thinks it the right thing to do. None seems ever to have left a City lunch and wandered down a high street. To them, the economy is about banks. For every word written and spoken about the real economy, a thousand are written about banks. The nation is suffering from mad Treasury disease. If I were a banker with RBS or Barclays or Lloyds, I would do exactly what they have done. Having made rotten business decisions in the past and now been offered limitless riches to cover them, I would take the money and say thank you. I would want to survive. Not a day passes without Whitehall officials calling bankers and pleading with them to lend to businessmen, baffled as to why their calls go unheeded. But there is no point in hoping that banks will keep borrowing lines open when the recipients' ability to repay is evaporating. In the absence of buoyant demand, credit is mere bad debt. Banks are about making money, not charity. They lost a fortune lending to unreliable borrowers and have no wish to go there again. Downing Street clearly does not understand this. I am told its denizens now wander about the office in a daze of impotence. They know only bankers to consult in their hour of need. Neither Brown nor his chancellor, Alistair Darling, has any experience of business or industry. The ministers dealing with the recession - Lord Mandelson, Lord Myners and Lady Vadera - are not even in the House of Commons. Their contact books are thick with City friends, City networks and City jobs awaiting them. Policy is now suffering acute metaphor fatigue. It is pouring money into buckets with holes, pushing string, throwing kitchen sinks, cleaning pipes. Better is the description of the American former labour secretary, Robert Reich, that it is ""socialism for rich bankers and capitalism for everyone else"". Last October Darling gave the banks £37bn of taxpayers' money (and the economy just £12bn of stimulus through VAT relief). That instantly vanished into Icelandic debts, toxic loans, dud mortgages, salaries and fees. Now Darling is giving the same banks another £50bn through subsidy ""products"" that would do credit to a dodgy derivatives trader. The British government has taken or borrowed an average of £2,000 from every man woman and child in just three months. This money has been devoted not to resuscitating the demand economy but to propping up de facto bankrupt banks. The gambit might have worked had it been deployed sooner, but the banking system is no longer working in the sense that justifies subsidy, the maintenance of confidence to advance credit. It is a huge piggy bank. I do not often agree with Labour MPs on economics, but I find it hard to quarrel with the chairman of the Commons Treasury committee, John McFall, who wrote last week in the Guardian that banks were ""acting rationally by retaining their capital and curtailing lending"". But since this was now ""suicide for the economy"", the job of lending to hard-pressed businesses should be taken on by a state bank, with no balance sheet to guard. Why not use the Post Office? What is amiss is not lending but spending, the lack of which is depriving every high street of oxygen. Yet Brown and Darling are still sucking spending power from the economy faster than in Margaret Thatcher's first two years in office, in 1980-1. The government must turn to Keynes. It should concentrate its attention and money on stimulating demand. Such spending may be laundered through a boost to construction and service jobs, though here the risk is of delayed impact and of merely helping rich potential savers (as in the Olympics). The fastest way of getting cash into the economy is by giving it to those who spend fastest, by a direct transfusion into every high street business and service. This means putting the limitless sums available to the chancellor into the pockets of those most likely to spend: pensioners, those on benefits, and those with children. That is easily done and requires no pleading with City knights. Governments can best help small businesses by underpinning their revenues, not their debts - by temporarily waiving VAT, national insurance or corporation tax, or by suspending regulatory impediments to economic activity. As I have proposed before, it could give away cashless vouchers to maintain demand for goods and services and thus keep lower paid workers in business. Other countries are doing this. Barack Obama is reputed to have a massive demand stimulus in the offing. The German government is giving away car purchase vouchers. It is revived demand that will get banks lending again. Brown and Darling seem uninterested in such things because their advisers cannot imagine the public being trusted to get Britain out of the recession. They see the public as wanton spendthrifts, ignoring the fact that spendthrifts are what the economy most needs. London now thinks recession can best be ended by top-down enforced lending. It cannot. It will end when people are encouraged to go out and spend. Sir Montagu Norman, governor of the Bank of England in the depression, later reflected: ""We achieved absolutely nothing except that we collected a lot of money from a lot of poor devils and gave it to the four winds."" It is astonishing that precisely the same blunder is being repeated, and millions will suffer. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com",Simon Jenkins: The nation has a bad case of mad Treasury disease,2009-01-21T00:01:00Z,Simon Jenkins,politics
"The ritual performed today on the steps of the US Capitol ­honoured tradition in every ­particular – even if America's new president stumbled over the time-honoured form of words that was his oath of office.  Americans, lacking a monarchy, attach a near-sacred reverence to the inauguration that serves as a kind of ­coronation: its precise order of ­ceremonies, its protocols. And Obama did nothing to challenge that today. True, Aretha Franklin sang My country 'tis of thee, and Yitzhak Perlman led a distinctly modern arrangement by film composer John Williams. But otherwise, this was an exercise in tradition. Yet Obama delivered a message that was anything but conservative, offering a thorough rebuttal of his predecessor's foreign policy and signalling a break in the nearly 30-year grip the notion of limited government has exerted on US politics. Taken together, what that brief spell under the blue winter skies of Washington DC suggested was an approach that may come to characterise the Obama presidency. It is conservative in style, radical in substance. So note the exclusive presence of Protestant clergy in today's proceedings, despite the celebration of inclusivity that Obama's inauguration symbolised for so many. What's more, the invocation was given by Rev Rick Warren, a powerful evangelist who maintains a hard line against abortion, and backed last year's California campaign to outlaw gay marriage. That choice outraged many on the left – among them those in the crowds who booed when Warren took the podium today – but it reassured America's cultural conservatives. Obama's personal style is similarly comforting to the right. They like the fact that he is sober and calm in demeanour, with a wife and two daughters who could be an advertisement for family values. They would have similarly warmed as he hymned the virtues required for the US to lift itself out of the hole it is in now. The challenges may be new, he said, ""But those values upon which our success depends – hard work and honesty, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and ­patriotism – these things are old."" Obama has written before of the pressure on a black man in a mainly white society to appear unthreatening. Whether that explains his serene public style or not matters less than its effect, which is to assure many Americans that there is nothing frighteningly radical about their new president. But just listen to what he said. In one exquisite paragraph, he repudiated – and terminated – the with-us-or-against-us, force-first-not-last, macho foreign policy of the Bush era. Obama recalled the ­earlier generations who defeated ­""fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks, but with sturdy ­alliances and enduring convictions.  They understood that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please. Instead, they knew that our power grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the justness of our cause, the force of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint.  Obama delivered a message that many on the left had hoped he would bring, and which many on the right equally feared. ""To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect."" The notion of a president speaking in such a way, and so directly, to the Muslim world would have been unimaginable just months ago. Obama offered a warning to dictatorships that could apply to those who have long been recipients of US aid and comfort. The rulers of Egypt, among others, may have shifted in their seats as they heard him say ""you are on the wrong side of history; but we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist"". Audiences around the world would have been heartened by that, as they would by Obama's unexpectedly intense focus on climate change. He returned to it several times, until it became one of the speech's clearest threads. ""Each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet,"" he said. Later he vowed to ""harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories"". There was a time when all this would have been condemned as dangerous radicalism in an American politician. But Obama's conservative style – the fact that he invented a new tradition this year, by speaking at inauguration eve dinners in honour of Colin Powell and John McCain – gives him the space to act differently where it matters, on the substance. There is a precedent, albeit indirect, for this trick. It comes from the man Obama hailed during the 2008 campaign as a ""transformational"" president: ­Ronald Reagan. Once elected, Reagan did not look over his shoulder at the previous consensus. Instead he seized the moment to drive through his own small government agenda, assuming the ­public would soon come around. He did not feel obliged to meet the centre-left halfway. And yet he wrapped it all in a warmth and charm that ensured it was not threatening. He too was a radical on substance, no matter how cosily traditional his style. So now it could be Obama's turn to be transformational, not just in the words of a speech but in the deeds that Americans will expect from him, starting today. Some early signs are encouraging, including the hint from senior counsellor David Axelrod that the next phase of the federal bail-out will be very different from the first tranche of spending under the man we can now call – with a deep, heartfelt sigh of relief – former President Bush. Obama will focus not on bailing out the banks but US workers. Expect a large dose of government spending on manufacturing industry, especially on projects with a green tinge. What could blow Obama off course? The Republican pollster Frank Luntz warns of two perils. The first danger comes from abroad. Now that Obama has promised to engage America's adversaries, he will enter unpredictable waters. If the new president were to have a summit with, say, the Iranians or even the Russians, and the meeting were to go badly, with Obama somehow seen to have been taken for a ride – then that might burst the Obama bubble. Alternatively, warns Luntz, if House Democrats tug the new president leftwards that could puncture the image of the bipartisan, above the fray leader – reducing him in the minds of the electorate to the status of just another politician. That's plausible enough, given the unpopularity of the Democratic brand in the years since 1980. But it might also badly underestimate the current ­appetite for change. The triangulations of Bill Clinton may well have been ­politically necessary 15 years ago. But now, having seen the economy plunge so badly, many Americans seem ready for more radical medicine. Still, none of this should obscure the wonder of what happened in ­Washington today. Perhaps two million people woke at dawn and made difficult journeys in the frigid cold not to go to the January sales or to see a free concert but to watch a politician become their president. God knows the US has been a difficult country to love these last eight years. But today it showed its most inspiring face – that it is still a nation that cherishes its unique experiment in self-government and still believes that even the darkest chapters in its past can be transcended.",Jonathan Freedland: All the conservative trappings freed Obama to frame a radical message,2009-01-20T21:49:28Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"It's no wonder that so many Icelanders are angry. They live in a country bankrupted by the excesses of their bankers, who took on liabilities 10 times the nation's GDP, betting billions in Britain's property bubble. Bailed out only by a jumbo IMF loan, inflation and interest rates are now 18% and rising. Many are considering emigration. Only membership of the euro, if it can be secured, offers a lifeline.  Ireland made the same bet, and on Friday the government had to nationalise its third biggest bank - Anglo Irish. Like the Icelandic banks, it had been speculating in Britain's property bubble. The joke across the Irish sea is that the only difference between Ireland and Iceland is one letter and six months. But there is another, more crucial, difference. Ireland is in the euro; otherwise, like Iceland, it would be bust. After what happened to the world's banks last week - and to Barclays Bank in particular, whose share price collapsed 25% in an hour on Friday - it's clear that Britain is at risk of being next in line. We too have a banking system that is huge in relation to our GDP, but, like Iceland, we are not in the euro. Unless we act quickly, decisively and cleverly, the difficulties of our banks could overwhelm us, triggering an enormous run on the pound. Britain, in short, risks bankruptcy. Friday's warning from the deputy governor of the Bank of England, Sir John Gieve, that more will almost certainly have to be done to save the banking system is a statement of the obvious. As was his grim assessment that the recession will be deeper and longer than anyone thought, even late last year. Britain's problem is threefold. We have an American-scale property crisis and a credit crunch in our own banking system. But on top, we were uniquely reliant on foreign banks and foreign capital. They support up to a third of all UK lending, and they have gone bust or fled. Britain's banks are in no position to plug the gap. So, the UK government has to put the system back together with a weak, non-reserve currency. Events in America last week showed how the contagion in so-called investment banking - I prefer casino banking - is murdering honest-to-God commercial banking. Bank of America and Citigroup are fighting for their lives as they are engulfed by losses from their investment/casino operations. Citigroup has had to break itself up, siphoning off its toxic assets in a separate entity insured by a $306 billion US government guarantee. Bank of America has been shattered by titanic losses in ""investment bank"" Merrill Lynch, which it bought just months ago. Without $20bn of taxpayer support and a $118bn guarantee of its toxic assets, it would be in receivership.  On top the US is able to keep finance flowing to its housing market only by offering federal guarantees on mortgage-backed securites. It also buys securities backed by car loans, student loans and credit card debt - anathema to the hyper-conservative Bank of England. Americans have the advantage that the dollar is the world currency - 64% of all foreign exchange reserves are held in dollars - so that it can do what it wants. Nonetheless it has taken monumental US taxpayer investment, guarantees of up to $500bn toxic loans and the willingness of the Federal Reserve to buy trillions of dollars of securitised assets even to begin to stabilise matters. Britain, by contrast, has not begun to mobilise on anything like the same scale - even though in many respects our crisis is more acute. Barclays, for example, is in a position analogous to Citigroup and Bank of America. In 2007 close to half its profits came from ""investment banking"", now so perilous for its American counterparts. Barclays is the leader in so-called corporate ""synthetic"" structured investment vehicles - complex and even more dodgy than the securities that have brought low Citigroup and Bank of America. On Friday credit-rating agency Moodys announced new and more demanding criteria for how ""synthetics"" will be valued in future - implying that bank guarantors will need to find billions extra in capital to support them. Barclays could have to raise up to another £10bn capital to support its investment bank operation; impossible, except from the taxpayer. With the ban on short selling lifted on Friday - an asinine genuflection to the interests of hedge funds - it was an obvious target. The bank rushed out a statement late in the evening declaring good 2008 profits and solid capital ratios. But the issue is 2009, given the new rules. A taxpayer bail-out for Barclays - a view shared by a growing number of officials, if not all - is close to inevitable. The prime minister is incandescent; the bank has not been straight with either the government or its shareholders about its balance-sheet risks. It did not share in the first round of bank recapitalisation, instead raising cripplingly expensive funds from Arab sovereign wealth funds. When Britain needs all its big banks to act together to stop a credit crunch-induced slump, Barclays, putting its own interests - and bonuses - first instead triggers a second phase of the crisis.  HSBC may also need to raise money - £20bn in the view of analysts at Morgan Stanley. But although it is headquartered in London and formally the responsibility of the UK, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (a lesson here for the Bank of England and FSA?) has independently regulated its Asian operations, and strictly. It is not - a Barclays, RBS or HBOS - yet. UK depositors owe Hong Kong a thank you. The cumulative cost of what has to be done is stunning, thanks to the City being such a vast part of our economy. The government must ensure that the banking system, Barclays included, has got sufficient capital to underpin the outstanding loans (at a much cheaper rate). Next it has to be prepared, like the Americans, to offer insurance guarantees on toxic loans which freeze the banks from new lending. Then it has to offer US-style guarantees on new issues of financial securities backed by mortgages, student loans, company loans and even credit card debt; and the Bank of England must be instructed to buy them. On top of this, there is a budget deficit next year of £118bn, which may have to increase again - with another big Obama-style fiscal stimulus - if the recession deepens. My view is that the financial markets will accept actual spending only if Britain pre-announces that after financial stabilisation has worked, it intends to join the euro - otherwise we will find ourselves in the same position as Iceland. These are the grimmest economic circumstances since the 1930s. Lives and businesses are being wrecked as I write. There will be little appetite for my proposed measures; how much better to hope that we can muddle through, looking for ""green shoots"" of recovery and doing little radical.  But after last week the government - and the opposition - have to get serious. Britain is on the edge.",Comment is free: Will Hutton: Unless we are decisive Britain faces bankruptcy,2009-01-18T00:01:00Z,Will Hutton,politics
"My chronic inability to take non-military baubles seriously means I have no idea whether there is such a thing as an EU medal of valour. There wouldn't be an Italian one, naturally - and if you get awfully affronted by blithe national stereotyping, you should certainly leave this article here - but something wonderful simply must be bestowed upon David Cerny, the Czech artist whose eight-tonne installation, Entropa, was this week unveiled in the atrium of the European Council in Brussels. Even if you remain oddly resistant to the tractor-beam allure of public art, you are urged to make an exception for this piece. By way of a summary, Mr Cerny won the commission to produce a work that would be a showpiece of the Czech presidency of the EU, the slogan of which is ""a Europe without barriers"". The result figures Europe's member states as parts of an Airfix-type model kit, and EU delegates present at its launch are said to have reacted with ""open-mouthed horror"". Brief highlights? Luxembourg is represented as a lump of gold with a ""for sale"" sign on it, Lithuania is pissing next door into Belarus, and Bulgaria has been depicted as a Turkish squat loo. Diplomatic incidents have ensued. Audacious doesn't really cover this one. It is as if Michelangelo had climbed down off his Sistine Chapel scaffold, and pulled away the sheet to reveal a vast ceiling painting of a Catholic priest molesting an altar boy. Cerny says he will repay his €50,000 of public funding (he really is playing it faultlessly), while the Czechs have taken the agonising decision to leave the thing up. They are terrified about starting a row about censorship, you see. What is not to love? Entropa is state of the art insult-spewing technology. It is the South Park of public sculptures, contriving to be hilarious at the same time as offending virtually everyone. I almost wept with laughter as the spokeswoman for the Bulgarian representation to the EU faced the television cameras and uttered the words: ""To see your country covered by Turkish toilets, we consider this an offence towards Bulgarian national dignity."" Get over it, Bulgaria! At least you're not Poland, whose enchanting stand on gay rights is represented by some priests planting a rainbow flag on a country that appears to be one giant turd. Or maybe it's a potato field. It's unclear. For his part, Cerny declares, ""Monty Python and Sacha Baron Cohen are probably the most exceptional examples of satiric politically incorrect humour"", and speculates that the British have been amused because ""they are able to take the joke better than some other nations"". Good of him to say so - then again, we have got off lightly, with a completely blank space representing our Europhobia. But it would be nice to think we might still be cackling even if we were depicted less mildly - maybe as an alcoholically poisoned, neocon-humping halfwit. Still, it's one less fire to fight for the mortified Czechs, who are frantically highlighting Cerny's insistence that the German entry - an arrangement of strips of autobahn - has nothing of the swastika to it. I half-wish Cerny had escalated things even further by declaring it a Rorschach test, but even he has limits. Indeed, he could have been far more offensive. Instead of France being depicted by a strike banner, he might simply have flown a white flag. Belgium might have been ... well, whatever the least charitable Belgian national stereotype is. Alternatively, he might have gone down the road of grotesquely exaggerated respect, depicting France as some emblem of humility - Jesus washing his disciples' feet, perhaps - with Germany a huge dove of peace. And before the Germans explode in wounded indignation, I should of course emphasise that we all realise how difficult it has been for you chaps to ""move on"" from the unpleasantness of last century, and acknowledge you've done marvellously well. Congratulations. Now, where were we? Oh yes. Spain could be a ""Free Nelson Mandela"" badge. The point of all this is, if Entropa alludes to entropy, namely a measure of the disorder of any system, then Cerny's piece of public art is an unalloyed triumph. Not only has it provoked mass debate, and added to the gaiety of nations, but it has become a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy. There is little Europeans like quite so much as looking down on their neighbours. Until now, the Eurovision Song Contest was perhaps the most perfect metaphor for the EU (except that all the power was concentrated in the east as opposed to the west). Each year, it shows how a league of nations can function as an entertaining idea, while still retaining - foregrounding, really - its deepest loathings and pettiest grudges. But now we have Entropa. And with various ambassadors scheduling detente about the sculpture, one might judge it better that the Czechs should spend their time having lots of angsty meetings about this sort of thing, rather than drafting more of their helpful interventions on Israel-Palestine. Mr Cerny must be saluted. Contrary to popular wisdom, you can occasionally fight city hall. marina.hyde@theguardian.com",Marina Hyde: Czech sculpture is an ideal metaphor for European Union,2009-01-17T00:01:00Z,Marina Hyde,world
"A Palestinian woman is standing in her kitchen when she hears a deafening bang. Rushing to her living room she sees her family in pieces, spread across floors, walls and ceiling. The horror is total and meaningless. Nobody meant it to happen, so what was its cause? The tragedy in Gaza surely marks the time when the world declares air-launched bombs and long-distance shells to be illegal under the 1983 Geneva convention. They should be on a par with chemical munitions, white phosphorous, cluster bombs and delayed-action land mines. They pose a threat to non-combatants that should be intolerable even in the miserable context of war. I can accept Israeli claims that they are not intentionally targeting civilians in Gaza - or the United Nations base set on fire yesterday. But the failure of their chosen armaments had the same effect. The civilian death toll is now put at 673, mostly women and children.  It is barely conceivable that the most accurate weapon of war, an infantryman, would deliberately enter a house and massacre unarmed women and children as they have their dinner. As a result, mercifully few do. When such cold-blooded murder is committed, from the 1968 My Lai killings in Vietnam to those now coming to light in Iraq, we are appalled, and inquiries, trials and disciplinary procedures follow.  Those killing from the air need have no sight of the carnage they unleash. They are placed at both a geographical and a moral distance, with a licence allowed no soldier on the ground. Whether they are dispatching free-fall bombs or GPS-guided missiles, tank shells or predator drones, Hamas's Qassam rockets or improvised explosive devices, they know they often miss their targets, but they launder any carnage as ""collateral damage"" and leave politicians to handle the backlash. The soldier shrugs and walks away, with no obligation to humanity beyond the occasional apology and a reference to the other side being just as bad.  If gas, landmines, chemical weapons and cluster munitions are now banned - a ban broadly obeyed by most civilised armies - why not aerial bombardment? Instead, bombing is becoming ever more prevalent. It precedes any operation, as a sort of overture, and eagerly takes part in each tactical twist. Counter-insurgency war, in Iraq and Afghanistan, has seen western armies take heavy casualties. But such is the political aversion to them that Israeli, American and British ground forces operate under strict ""force protection"" rules to minimise losses.  This has led to the reckless use of stand-off munitions, as regularly reported by embedded correspondents. Rather than employ infantry to clear an apparently hostile settlement, commanders call in air strikes and pound it to rubble. The Israelis have responded to the Hamas bombardment of their towns with a far heavier bombardment of Gaza. Both endanger civilians to a degree that cannot be other than criminal. That human shield tactics may be involved is no excuse: the law does not permit the killing of innocents in the hope of reaching the guilty.  The bombing of urban infrastructure is an act of terror, meant to weaken the resistance of victims and cause them to surrender. This was the case with the west's bombing of Belgrade in 1999 and Baghdad in 2003, the latter under the openly terrorist rubric of ""shock and awe"". Neither achieved the ambition proclaimed by the champions of air power, Bomber Harris's promise ""to win the war from the air"". In an extraordinary article on these pages yesterday, David Miliband declared the title ""war on terror"" to be ""misleading and mistaken"". It apparently ""gave the impression of a unified, transnational enemy, embodied in the figure of Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida"". In reality terrorism was a disparate phenomenon, often internal to state politics. Besides, wrote the foreign secretary: ""Terrorists succeed when they force countries to respond with violence and repression.""  Miliband is right. But those who have been saying this since 9/11 wonder what has caused this sudden conversion. Did Miliband protest when Tony Blair reportedly pleaded with George Bush to be the first to bomb Kabul in 2001? Is this the same Miliband who sat silent as a member of the government that supported ""shock and awe""? Is he now pleading with the Americans to stop using weapons against the Pashtun - such as aerial assassination - that exacerbate both war and terror?  The truth is that the war Miliband is still waging against militant Islam has been conducted largely by weapons of terror, namely bombs and long-distance artillery shells. They have killed untold thousands of non-combatants since the ""war"" began in 2001 - a violence far more devastating than the Israelis have inflicted on Gaza - destroying unimaginable numbers of homes.  In his book Shock of the Old, the science historian David Edgerton cites the bomber as the most overrated of all weapons of war. Glamorous, noisy, ostensibly sophisticated and easily marketed to ""techno-dazzled"" generals, it has proved an ineffective killing machine. Its use against the perpetrators of terror is a classic of soldiers fighting the last war but one. In Vietnam, Serbia, Lebanon, Iraq and Afghanistan, those deploying bomber power constantly promised more than they could deliver, as they did before D-day. As Correlli Barnett has remarked, as in Vietnam and Kosovo so now in Gaza, the airman's bombast, that he could terrify the enemy into surrender, must be rectified by troops on the ground. Time and again the bomber has been outgunned by the AK-47. No weapon fired at a distance can be sure of its target. As Colin Powell once said, the phrase ""tactical surgical strike"" had him racing for the protection of his bunker. All the electronics in the world seem unable to prevent constant friendly fire deaths. Meanwhile, the dominance of air forces in procurement battles has left Britain's land army woefully under-equipped.  In modern asymmetric warfare inaccurate munitions are worse than useless, they are a gift to enemy propaganda. In the present Gaza turkey shoot, the Israelis cannot have intended to hit the UN, knowing the impact it would have on world opinion. But once embarked on the campaign they clearly cannot discipline themselves.  In Afghanistan the American commander, David Petraeus, is said to regard his own side's bombing of villages and wedding parties as utterly counterproductive. Yet once forces are deployed, with ground and air in partnership, they seem beyond all command and control. They illustrate Liddell Hart's comment on military technology, that ""the progress of weapons has outstripped the minds of those who wield them"".  If Israel fails to win its political objectives in Gaza, it will in part be because of its massively destructive attempt to terrify the Palestinians into surrender from the air. Every errant missile explodes on the television screens of the world.  In the complex politics of war, these weapons are like torture. They numb moral sensibility and do harm beyond all justification of victory. They should be abolished. If we wish to kill other people for whatever reason, we should use only weapons that kill the right ones. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com",Simon Jenkins: Indiscriminate slaughter from the air is a barbarism that must be abolished,2009-01-16T00:01:00Z,Simon Jenkins,world
"Are there any tried and tested cures for a creeping schadenfreude dependency? It is not an edifying affliction, as you would certainly have ruled had you eavesdropped on my side of a telephone conversation this week, which ran along the lines of: ""Cristiano Ronaldo, you say? Car crash, you say? Walked away unscathed but the £200,000 Ferrari's a write-off? Ooh, colour me crushed."" Alas, how quickly the cheap thrill of schadenfreude turns to dust. It was the same a few hours later when it emerged that Princess Beatrice had gone shopping and left the keys in the ignition of the BMW which her father (aka you) had bought her for her 17th birthday. The car was nicked, of course, but any feelings of satisfaction swiftly disappeared, like so many ... well, like so many unlocked vehicles in central London. But this isn't about sublimely pointless junior members of the royal family, or indeed about Cristiano Ronaldo, who was darling enough to alleviate my guilt by sweeping out of his drive in his jalopy - a Bentley Continental - the next morning. No, this is still about the bankers. A couple of months ago I wrote here about the distinct absence of public contrition among the erstwhile masters of the universe, the Bizarro Justice League, whose superpower is being able to set your money on fire for a seven-figure salary (plus bonus). However, unless I have missed ""bankers' week"" on the Jeremy Kyle show, we have yet to take delivery of our pound of flesh, and as a result people like me - please let there be others - seem to be seeking out cheap thrills at others' misfortunes wherever we can score them. Poor Beatrice and Cristiano were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. You wouldn't call it impotent rage, really - it's not noble enough for that, even if it is rooted in righteous anger. It's more like impotent snark. And you feed it how you can. Last September, a pair of laid-off Bear Stearns investment bankers set up a blog called bankergonebroke.com, wherein they dispensed tips they were picking up as they adjusted to life on civvy street. They recommended amazing money-saving ideas, like buying cutlery and eating at home. It prompted people to post comments like: ""Yes, also there are these wonderful transport vehicles - 'subways' - that run beneath the ground."" Just reading the impotent snark felt cathartic. But after a while you need more, and the comments became more darkly amusing. Things like: ""Let me know when it gets so bad they start eating each other."" According to several research studies, those who experience strongest feelings of schadenfreude tend to have lower self-esteem. Yes, I'd tell my notional psychiatrist. We have low self-esteem because they set all our money on fire. Unfortunately, once you're a schadenfreude junkie, trawling life in search of a fix, you end up seeing things you can't unsee, and it was while scouring the comments section of a Daily Mail story confirming that one of our nationalised banks would still be paying huge bonuses that I stumbled on the thoughts of ""Steven, London"".  Steven, London was ""one of those people getting a big bonus"", he explained. ""It's based on how much money I made the company over the last 12 months. Hedge funds actually did quite well and with share prices falling it was like a Harrods sale on the FTSE. I did my job well and I'm being rewarded so what's wrong with that? Moan all you like, but I'm off to the Maldives to celebrate."" But that's like the woman who patrols the pick'n'mix area in Taunton Woolworths expecting her two weeks' skiing in Gstaad to be funded on the basis that she did better than the chaps in music and DVDs! It does, however, make me realise my addiction is quite low-level. I am functionally schadenfreudian. It is Steven, London, who is addicted to a worldview that plenty of us long recognised as destructive. Perhaps the best way to help us all ""move on"" from the chaos their habit has wrought in our lives is if all senior bankers were forced to stop living in denial, and commit to a version of the Alcoholics Anonymous 12-step programme (only without all the God rubbish, obviously). You know how it goes: they must admit they were powerless over money - and that their dealings with it had become unmanageable. They must make a searching and fearless moral inventory of themselves. They must admit to themselves and to another human being the exact nature of their wrongs. They must make a list of all persons they have harmed, and become willing to make amends to them all. They must continue to take personal inventory and when they were wrong promptly admit it. For my own part, I will endeavour to realise that no one is as disappointed in Princess Beatrice as she is in herself.marina.hyde@theguardian.com",Marina Hyde: I may be a schadenfreude junkie - but at least I'm not a banker in denial,2009-01-10T00:01:00Z,Marina Hyde,uk
"One of the finest short stories by an English writer is The Death of Simon Fuge by Arnold Bennett, which the great chronicler of the Potteries published in 1907. I read it again this Thursday on the train from London to Stoke, for the perfectly good reason that this is also how the story opens. The narrator, a specialist in ceramics, is travelling north to the Potteries for the first time to meet a fellow enthusiast. The narrator reveals himself as rather smug and effete; industrial Staffordshire is to have a transforming effect. When he reaches Stoke - always called Knype in Bennett's fiction - he finds a landscape of coal dust, potsherds, flame and steam: ""a squalid ugliness on a scale so vast and overpowering that it became sublime"". That landscape, of course, vanished years ago. It belonged to the era of the coal-fired bottle oven - the six towns that compose Stoke once had 3,000 of them - when 50,000 men, women and children shaped, fired and glazed clay to transform it into crockery for the tables of the world. Nearly 40 bottle ovens have been preserved and poke up next to ""factory shops"" (sometimes with no factory attached) on bedraggled streets that only occasionally seem built-up and peopled enough to suggest a town, far less a city. There is no Waitrose. Entry by rail gives the best clue to how things once were. You leave a Victorian station to face an old railway hotel in mock Jacobean, and in between a statue to Josiah Wedgwood, who has been standing on his plinth since 1865, a national hero produced by the local economy. Now the company he founded two and half centuries ago has gone bust. People in Stoke say this is a great shame, a sin, a tragedy that ""can't be allowed to happen"" to the most famous name in porcelain. Blame extends from the generally unfortunate state of the world to particular causes. Wedgwood should never have been merged with Waterford Crystal; it should never have taken over Royal Doulton; moving some production to Indonesia had been a mistake. Who can tell? All we know is that two of Waterford Wedgwood's biggest shareholders, Tony O'Reilly and his brother-in-law Peter Goulandris, sank hundreds of millions into the company and couldn't make it a success. Perhaps we should be looking at another culprit: the death of the English ornament.  You will remember the display cabinet. Perhaps, like me, you have inherited your parents'. Ornaments were what they displayed - the very best kind, too precious to be stood on the mantelpiece or the sideboard where a casual dusting (and how much this labour of dusting was stressed!) might shatter a ballet dancer's figurine. In the late 1950s, when disposable incomes rose, elegant little items began to appear in the cabinets of ordinary homes that shamed the cruder souvenirs of seaside resorts. Our example was a round box with a lid, perhaps a container for powder or pills (though it never contained either). The surface was matt and light blue in colour, with the decoration (urns, garlands) raised in white relief. ""Wedgwood,"" my mother said proudly. We had moved up the social scale, ornaments-wise, but how little did we appreciate the enormous effort that Josiah Wedgwood had put into perfecting his ""jasperware"", in his search for a material that shared the surface qualities of a Roman vase. Wedgwood meticulously recorded 5,000 experiments over three years until he began production in the late 18th century. The rich were crazy about classical antiquity, while the poor were just coming to terms with eating from earthenware dishes. It would have been inconceivable that the delicate classical decoration of his jasperware would ever be affordable to ordinary people, and consequently in itself ordinary and therefore unfashionable and less desirable. It can happen to the finest brand. The ceramics gallery at the Potteries Museum in Hanley is a good place to understand how fashion works and how it can die. It has the world's largest collection of north Staffordshire pieces - 50,000 of them - and, according to the assistant curator, Andrew Watts, most are the outcome of the pottery business trying to maximise profits by leading or following changes in public taste. And sometimes taste in the most literal sense; it was the swelling consumption of tea in the 1760s that led to the teapot and the teacup and - his big breakthrough - Wedgwood's commission from Queen Charlotte for a royal tea set. ""Fashion, fashion, fashion!"" Watts said, pointing out that Wedgwood was an entrepreneurial as well as a technical genius, who set up a London showroom and made sure his wares reached the nobility first so that they became envied objects. He styled himself ""potter to Her Majesty"" and announced his intention to become ""Vase Maker General to the Universe"". He had started out as a maker of what he called ""useful wares"". He never abandoned utility, but it was his second line, ""ornamental wares"", that captured the public imagination. Commemorative medallions, busts of the famous, copies of classical vases: all the ceramic clutter we associate with museum shops and off-the-page offers in magazines began with him.  That may be the heart of the Wedgwood problem: however well made it may be, they have made too much of it. Where is the cachet? My parents' sense of achievement 50 years ago when they placed their jasperware carefully inside the cabinet - ""You can tell it's real Wedgwood"" - would echo now in far fewer homes. ""Twee"" is a word you hear. Wedgwood has a glorious history of lovely and useful crockery, but people insist on remembering the anniversary mugs.  It would be a mistake to imagine that if Wedgwood goes, Staffordshire pottery will come to an end. Spode and Royal Worcester entered administration in November, but about 10,000 people still work ""in the pots"". Firms such as Dudson, Steelite and Churchill continue to earn profits from hardy tableware for hotels, while smaller ""design-led"" potteries such as Emma Bridgewater and Moorcroft do well at the other end of the market, illustrating the point that size is the enemy of fashion. At Moorcroft, I watched women skilfully apply colour to the most complex floral and animal outlines - the craftsmanship unchanged since Moorcroft got going with the art nouveau styles of the 1900s in this very factory. The trick is rarity and price; vases sell in limited editions with ""Made in Stoke-on-Trent, England"" stamped on the bottom, and a jardiniere costs £11,500.  Finally, I took a taxi to Barlaston, where Josiah Wedgwood's successors moved to a big new factory, set amid trees and lawns, in 1940 and where, only three months ago, the company opened a museum built at a cost of nearly £10m. The epigram at the entrance states, ""This museum is dedicated to the people of who have made objects of great beauty from the soil of Staffordshire.""  The factory next door will probably close. A thousand will be sacked. Whatever mistakes Wedgwood have made, however much they have been caught out by changing aesthetics or British labour costs, you would need a heart of earthenware to refuse to be moved by those words.",Ian Jack: How the display cabinet killed Wedgwood,2009-01-10T00:01:00Z,Ian Jack,uk
"So we are doomed. The boffins have tried everything yet the disease rages unchecked. Economists are retreating from the recessionary front, wild-eyed and covered in blood. The public has recourse to others, to soothsayers and purveyors of prayers, jujus and magic mushrooms. They are having a field day. The historians are leaping up and down, warbling that things are ""the worst since"", variously, 1992 or 1981 or the 70s or the 30s. It is like climatologists warning that a particular year is the hottest (or coldest) since a previous one was even hotter or colder. Circumstances are never different. History obeys Occam's law of simplicity. The Marxists are ecstatic. Eric Hobsbawm has returned from the ideological grave to declare ""the greatest crisis of capitalism since the 1930s"" and the dramatic equivalent of the fall of the Soviet Union, hardly a precedent he should recall. The website permanentrevolution.net is awash in glee. ""So much for marginal utility theory and neoconservatism,"" cries Bill Jefferies. The ""affluenza"" guru, Oliver James, is unequivocal. From the security of a successful career he declares that wealth only drives us mad. ""One of the great boons of the sudden collapse of neoliberalism,"" he says, ""is that needs will no longer be conflated with wants."" Such Marxist terminology should put an end to most of the British manufacturing and service industry. People, says James, should now spend more time with their families and ""rediscover their hobbies, such as sports, stamp-collecting and trainspotting"". Long-wave theorists are back in fashion. Millenarians see the dawn of a new class struggle, in which the masses rise up and shake off their oppressive capitalist debts, like bankrupt African dictators. Philosophers are no less barmy. The normally sane AC Grayling declares the credit crunch a ""classic display of non-rational behaviour"", ignoring the essence of financial bubbles, that they result from individuals behaving rationally in the short-term, but without adequate regulation to marry short to long. Debt mountains may be motivated by love of money, but economies depend on postponed gratification, on profitable saving, to grow. Not Marx but Niebuhr is needed to police this boundary between ""moral man and immoral society"". Grayling has one solution, to his credit. He has come across a hormone called oxytocin. Administered nasally, it is said ""in tests"" to double the level of trust between game players. The government should therefore line up all bankers and spray oxytocin up their noses. As a policy it could hardly be worse than spraying them with money. This is upstaged by a van spotted in London advertising ""dial-a-philosopher"", a 24-hour emergency on-call service ""to deal with your existential angst at a moment's notice"". The advice to sufferers in the credit crunch is ""don't even think about it, call us"". The service is available only inside the M25, and presumably as of April 1. Bishops are having an even better time. When a crisis is a total mystery, the mystifiers are in a state of grace. A ban has presumably been put on the parable of the talents (a servant castigated by Christ for saving rather than investing). The Church of England feels we had it coming to us, though it unfortunately omitted to warn us beforehand. We are duly doomed for our debt and greed. The Bishop of Manchester declares the ""collapse of the god of materialism and consumerism"" (a deity unknown to me) and its replacement by a god who apparently will ""force us to think again"". The bishop is clearly a polytheist. Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor is adamant that ""the market economy will only work justly if it has an underlying moral purpose"", a redundancy if ever I saw one. As for the Archbishop of Canterbury, he seems in a perpetual state of despair. We must not, he said at Christmas, go the way of Hitler. Quite so. Last week the BBC curiously allowed a handful of celebrities to hijack its Today programme to boost themselves, their businesses and their favourite charities. One hilarious nugget was an interview in which the boss of Citibank, Sir Win Bischoff, interviewed an Olympic cyclist on what cycling could teach banking. Amid the waffle there was no mention of what had maintained both individuals in 2008: truly stupefying amounts of taxpayers' money. There was not so much as a thank you. The belief in the virtues of a hair shirt, but not on my own back, is embedded in Britain's puritanical establishment. It believes that, since the poor in some sense deserved recession, nasty medicine will be good for their collective soul. The bursting of the housing bubble, so liberally pumped by politicians, is taken to prove the sin of plebeian greed. The fact that every policymaker is straining every muscle to find a way back to wealth from recession suggests that hair shirts have yet to acquire political traction. That does not stop the moral pundits. Just as Christmas is a time to be jolly and April Fools' Day to be silly, perhaps a week should be set aside for completely daft remarks about the economy. Cardinals can demand moral markets. Prime ministers can take people's money and shower it on banks. Peter Mandelson can declare himself content with the institutional embezzlement of bonuses. Yvette Cooper can declare getting on the housing ladder ""a right and a necessity"" for every young person. The Bishop of Reading can advocate ""putting the waiting back into wanting"", just when the economy needs us to spend for dear life. I have no idea what is going to happen over the coming year and nor does anyone else. The futurology game has been shot to ribbons, making fools of everyone. Economic forecasting has collapsed in ignominy and if there were any justice the profession would be sacked en masse. Nostradamus would do a better job than Alistair Darling's lot. The only recourse is to history. History teaches that all recessions end, when people resume spending and when businesses can start borrowing against that spending. When this happens, as it will, we shall forget that 2008 marked the end of Thatcherism or the collapse of capitalism or the dawn of socialism. The cobblers will return to their lasts. As it is, house prices are still not back to where they were at the start of the decade. Unemployment, admittedly a flexible concept, is not back to its level of 20 years ago. The third of the workforce on protected government wages or pensions are safe from sorrow - and presumably still spending. At the time of the three-day week in 1974, which on any measure of tolerability was worse than today, a retired colonel wrote to the Times deploring the gloom then rife in the paper's columns. To be sure, Britain was stricken with strikes, power cuts and unemployment. It was widely thought to be ungovernable and possibly on the brink of revolution. But come on, said the colonel, Britain would do what it had always done. It would ""muddle through ... yours faithfully"". It did. Likewise the present crisis will pass and the current punditry will be seen as a silly and damaging exercise in talking down confidence. But that spoils the fun. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com • This article was amended on Wednesday 21 January 2009.

"The first response to word that Barack Obama is prepared to make contact – albeit low-level and clandestine – with Hamas should be caution.  For one thing, the very act of revealing such a move can make it less likely. If the Obama camp comes under heavy criticism from those opposed to engagement with Hamas, it may be forced to deny it countenanced the idea at all. Obama has been super-careful to say next to nothing during the Gaza crisis – and certainly nothing at odds with the Bush administration. He would clearly not have chosen to make this policy shift public. (That said, it's bound to be welcomed by those in the Muslim world who have been angered by his virtual silence this last fortnight.)  Second, even the limited opening to Hamas apparently under discussion in the Obama circle is pretty conditional. It seems to be premised either on Hamas taking a ""decisive drubbing"" in Gaza or on a reconciliation with Fatah. Neither of those outcomes is guaranteed.  Nevertheless, those of us who have long believed that peace depends on engaging with all parties to a conflict – and that peace is made with your enemies rather than with your friends – have reason to be cheered by this news, tentative as it is.  It suggests that Obama means to follow through on the principle he articulated repeatedly in the 2008 election campaign: that diplomacy is not some kind of reward for good behaviour, but rather an essential component in any nation's toolkit. The US would never foreswear the use of force to advance its vital interests, yet the Bush administration did precisely that with diplomacy – denying itself that essential tool when it came to the nations it consigned to outer darkness: the axis of evil trio of Iraq, Iran and North Korea, along with Syria and, of course, Hamas.  Obama promised to do things differently, saying he would even speak to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad if it would help. The one group he seemed least keen to meet was Hamas, placing clear and steep conditions on any dialogue. Indeed in April 2008 he slapped down former president Jimmy Carter for meeting the Islamist movement. ""We must not negotiate with a terrorist group intent on Israel's destruction,"" Obama said. ""We should only sit down with Hamas if they renounce terrorism, recognise Israel's right to exist and abide by past agreements."" If the latest signals are to be believed, Obama is now ready to soften the edges of those conditions. For those who believe that, whether we like it or not, Hamas is now part of the Palestinian reality and that no peace can ever come unless all the major players on both sides – Israeli and Palestinian – are included, this is a small, unofficial, unconfirmed but welcome move in the right direction.",Jonathan Freedland: Barack Obama's apparent willingness to engage with Hamas is heartening,2009-01-08T21:23:19Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"Small businesses are enraged about the new Benylin advert. No, not because it takes an awe-inspiring Gregory Isaacs song and turns it into the soundtrack for suburban snuffles. That's Night Nurse. The cough mixture's manufacturers have suggested that those who feel unwell should stay in bed and take a ""Benylin day"".  Presumably, they want this to turn into a buzz-phrase on the usage-scale of ""duvet day"" to mean ""not so ill that you're actually ill, but ill enough ... hang on ... are we a medicine, or just a tasty syrup?"" It's a wink-wink, ""we all do our sore-throat voice for a sickie, even when we're pretending to have cystitis, don't we, eh, eh?"" style of advert, which in itself is nothing unusual, but in this case transgresses a fundamental rule of business. Before anything else, before they get down even to their core task of flogging things to us, they have to stick together. Cough medicine companies have to pretend that, illness be damned, we all love work and have a sworn, unbreachable fealty to our employer. I was struck, on this account, by another advert, for the NatWest free financial advice scheme, in which a friendly NatWest lady tells a customer to ditch his gym membership and go for a run in the park. That just isn't the way things are done, is it? One business, telling the world that another business is a waste of money? Next we'll have magazines telling readers that nobody ever got laid because of a pedicure. What we have left of an economy will grind to a total halt. Commerce, until now, has acted with a surprising, almost heartening, although slightly mafia-esque, sense of community. Then - wham - one tiny, although since you mention it, vast, earth-shattering recession, and it's every cough mixture/high street banking facility for himself.  The Federation of Small Businesses has done more than complain, in fact, it has reported the ad to the Advertising Standards Authority (they may be small, but goddammit, they know how to overreact), who I guess are looking into it. But I can save everyone the trouble by saying that the ASA normally responds to complaints with the requirement that adverts offend ""large numbers of viewers"", and this won't offend anybody. Plus, the federation does itself no favours at all with its spokesman, Stephen Alambritis (whose name in itself sounds like a condition you should stay in bed for), who said: ""If people have real flu then of course they should take the day off, but if it is just a cold then they should not."" Leaving aside inter-business squabbling, this is more controversial than he apparently realises. Nothing is so clear-cut in the world of malady from the thorax up. There are rules, but they are not Alambritis's rules: much is made of the inability of men, for starters, even to be able to distinguish between a cold and flu. Hence the term ""man-flu"", which is used, correctly, to describe a flu that is really a cold - but you will also often hear it used incorrectly to describe a cold that is far worse than a regular cold.  I believe this egregious usage originated with Lemsip, and its ""flu max"" innovation: the first mainstream, documented instance of someone describing as ""flu"" something that can be alleviated with caffeine and paracetamol and, ergo, is not flu. All these ambiguities can be solved in a stroke by the flu definition I read on a doctor's surgery leaflet once, which was ""if you can walk to the chemist, it isn't flu"". It's totally incapacitating, this illness: you do not need the FSB or anyone else to tell you to stay in bed; it would take a horse or a crane to get you out of bed.  Naturally, this leaves under the umbrella term ""cold"" many symptoms that would make it totally senseless to go into work. There are people who still pride themselves on their stoicism, hardiness and ambition (though there are fewer than you think - the Sun reported an astonishing 2.4 million sickies called in on Monday, across the UK) but most sensible people are in broad agreement that you do the workplace no favours if you slog in, do nothing all day except complain, feed your germs into the air conditioning system and infect the rest of the office. It's antisocial, apart from anything else; but unlike coughing without your hand over your mouth (also antisocial), it doesn't even have the benefit of energy-saving. You lose, your office loses, the public transport infrastructure loses. The only winner is the virus, and that's only if we assume some Darwinian flourishing impulse on the part of the cold, which I can't believe it has, otherwise it would be fatal by now (flu, on the other hand ... ). I am often heartened by the number of GPs who take time out of their busy schedule to call Radio 4's You and Yours and pass on this simple advice. Don't come crying to us. Go back to bed, you idiots, and listen to You and Yours. The only thing anybody normal goes into work with, then, is a cold so minor it is really just a runny nose and a low voice. The FSB has chosen the wrong target, and come out blazing about the wrong thing, and Benylin has shown itself closer to the national pulse. Though I do not think this is why people buy it; they buy it because it is tasty. mszoewilliams@yahoo.co.uk",Benylin advert accepts it's fine to take a sick day,2009-01-07T00:01:00Z,Zoe Williams,society
"The scenes of calamity just get worse. Yesterday Guardian readers awoke to an image that will haunt many for years to come: three young children, their eyes closed as if in sleep, laid out dead on a hospital floor. One was no bigger than a baby; next to him, a toddler wearing junior tracksuit trousers, the kind your own son might wear. Except these were dyed red with blood. Somehow, and quickly, even that horror was surpassed with the news yesterday that a UN school, used as a shelter, had been hit, killing more than 40 Palestinians, more than half of them women or children. Israel says Hamas fighters were launching mortar shells from the UN facility, which is why Israel hit back. Either way, Operation Cast Lead seems designed to leaden the heart with sorrow. Still, Britons and Americans have no cause for self-righteousness. The scale of the Israeli offensive is shocking, and yet the killing is not of a greater order than that of the two wars, in Iraq and Afghanistan, in which our very own British troops are taking part. I spoke yesterday with one foreign diplomat based in Jerusalem who recalled how, during an earlier posting in Afghanistan, he had seen the remains of an entire village razed to the ground by American fighter jets in pursuit of a couple of Taliban commanders. ""All that was left was rubble and body parts,"" he says now. Seen in the context of the last seven years, the grim truth is that Israelis are not guilty of a unique crime in Gaza. When and how will this end? ""The sooner, the better,"" says Ehud Olmert, the accidental prime minister whose tenure began with the pounding of southern Lebanon and will end with the pummelling of Gaza. He told Ha'aretz last night he is in touch with world leaders seeking a diplomatic way out - but he did not sound like a man in a hurry. The conventional wisdom suggests crises like this conclude when the international community finally says enough is enough. But in the Middle East, the international community is a fiction. The only pressure that counts is Washington's and nothing is coming from that direction. George Bush fully endorses Israel's action and Barack Obama is sticking to the protocol that a president-elect keeps his mouth shut till he has sworn the oath on January 20. That leaves the only pressure that can divert Israeli governments: Israeli public opinion. If the fathers and mothers of Israel's soldiers turn on this operation, then its days will be numbered. For that to happen, the Israel Defence Forces would have to sustain serious casualties. Support for the 2006 war in Lebanon melted once too many Israeli families were burying their dead.  But that does not seem to be about to happen. For one thing, the IDF is currently winning plaudits from the Israeli press for proceeding gingerly, pushing its ground troops forward with caution as if they have learned some of the operational lessons of 2006. More importantly, Hamas is not staging anything like the opposition mounted by Hezbollah in Lebanon, when Israeli fatalities reached triple figures.  It lacks the resources of Hezbollah, with its open border and supply lines to Syria. Hamas is in tiny, sealed-off Gaza. True, it is backed by Iran - which partly explains the strength of support for Cast Lead from an Israeli public long fearful of an Iranian proxy on its southern border - but relying on smuggled kit is not the same as having a powerful patron across the border. Unless, of course, this is all a fiendish plot by the Hamas leadership. On this theory, they are not really cowering in their underground bunkers - too scared to resist, saving their own skins, as the uncle of those dead toddlers accusingly told the Guardian yesterday. Instead they are waiting to lure the IDF in, enticing Israeli troops deep into Gaza's cities where they will be most vulnerable. But in the absence of such a lethal Hamas fightback, the ending of this conflict will be in Israel's hands. The Israelis won't end it now, not when they are still finding weapons caches or other Hamas military capacity to be degraded. It is too tempting to press on, to crush the enemy. That way Israel gets to claim what it could not in 2006: a clear and total victory.  But there is a massive risk here. Such a victory will not just achieve Cast Lead's original stated aim, namely altering Hamas's calculus - reducing its incentive to fire rockets at civilian targets inside Israel - but could topple the Hamas government altogether. Israeli officials deny that regime change in Gaza is either likely to happen or the goal of their mission. But that may end up being the result: intelligence reports suggest the organisation has been eviscerated, its ability to govern all but destroyed. Israeli leaders will crow at that; their poll numbers will surge. But it will surely prove a pyrrhic victory. For what would be the consequences of crippling the Hamas administration in Gaza? Israel would be confronted with a sharp dilemma. Either it would have to stay, resuming the occupation it sought to end in 2005 - a notion with zero popular appeal in Israel. Or it would have to withdraw, leaving behind a huge and dangerous question mark. For Gaza could become a vacuum, rapidly descending into Somalia, a lawless badland of warlords and clans. A new force could seek to replace Hamas. Most likely it would be even more radical: al-Qaida has long been pushing at the edges of Gaza, eager to find a way in. Would either of those options appeal to Israel? Of course they wouldn't. As one Israeli commentator put it yesterday: ""In this context the IDF is afraid of being too successful."" Israel's preferred scenario, having pushed Hamas out of the way, is for the pro-western moderates of Fatah to take over. But Fatah knows that to return to Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank is the kiss of death: they would for ever be branded collaborators with the enemy. Israel may try to dump responsibility for Gaza on a coalition of moderate Arab states and others, including the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority. But would any of them be willing to take it on? Analyst Ahmad Khalidi notes that the ""amount of aid, reconstruction and psychological nursing is of such intensity"" that surely no one would step in. Israel may be left recalling what Colin Powell once called the Pottery Barn rule: ""You break it, you own it"". And from the rubble of Gaza, the attacks on Israel will surely resume. Hamas is too deeply rooted to disappear. New cells will arise, more filled with hatred and bent on revenge than ever. Already there are warnings of a return to suicide bombing, inside Israel and beyond. And, warns Khalidi, there would be no Hamas leadership - with undeniable discipline over its forces and the pragmatism to see the benefits of a ceasefire - to rein in these new, angry fighters. The great irony is that Israel may well decapitate Hamas - only to regret the passing of a Palestinian administration with sufficient stature to bring order. Perhaps Israel's leadership will see this danger and hold back, pushing for a ceasefire that would be robust and externally supervised but would ultimately, if indirectly, amount to a deal with Hamas. If that is the outcome, it will be a strange kind of victory. For Israel could have got that through diplomacy, without causing the death, mayhem and damage to its international reputation now unfolding before our eyes. If it goes further, it will have removed one danger - only to have replaced it with one far greater. freedland@theguardian.com • This article will be open to comments on January 7 from 09:00 GMT",Jonathan Freedland: Gaza after a Hamas rout will be an even greater threat to Israel,2009-01-07T00:01:00Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"On the last day of the old year we walked up Canada Hill on the island of Bute. Mist blurred our view from the top, which on a clear day is one of the Firth of Clyde's great panoramas. The boundaries between sea and land were indistinct. A ghostly ship rode at anchor to the north of Cumbrae, probably a bulk carrier waiting to unload a cargo of cheap South African coal, or perhaps (because the hull was high in the water) it had already unloaded and lay in the Clyde ""waiting for orders""; one of those nautical terms that seem so romantic, unless you happen to be the owner of a bulk carrier fleet faced with a world depression and hundreds of idle ships. Nothing in our view moved and apart from the cries of some distant herring gulls there was perfect silence. Canada Hill wasn't always like this. It gets its local name from the days when people would gather here to say farewell to the emigrant ships sailing downriver from Glasgow and Greenock to North America, several cargoes every month of Scottish people bound for the New World, watched from Canada Hill by their passengers' sorrowing relations until the smoke from their furnaces was a smudge on the horizon. Or this at least is the story. A sceptical mind might wonder about the likelihood of Glaswegians taking the time and trouble to reach Bute by train and ferry, then walking uphill for a mile and a half, all in the cause of seeing a faraway ship that contained brother Sandy, when even with the aid of a telescope he could be seen only as one dot among many crowded at the rail and bound quite cheerfully for his new job in Montreal. The greater likelihood may be that only the people of Bute came up this hill to watch the ships, and sometimes one or two of them would have a relative on board. Emigration breeds emotion; emotion breeds romance. After we came down from Canada Hill on Wednesday I watched a TV commercial for ""Scotland's Year of Homecoming"", a campaign inspired by the Scottish government to persuade emigre Scots and their descendants to visit Scotland, extending the welcome to so-called ""affinity Scots"" (that is, other people who merely like the place) so as to broaden the market and avoid charges of the racial exclusivity that the word ""homeland"" usually brings in its trail. In the words of Alex Salmond, the Year of Homecoming ""is about reuniting Scots and friends of Scotland with the aspects of commonality that bind them together, allowing them to share the pleasure and pride of our culture and heritage.""  In the context of Scottish politics, it isn't a partisan project. The previous Labour administration, casting around for a way to celebrate the 250th anniversary of Robert Burns's birth, came up with the idea four years ago and every other party has signed up. Burns remains the centrepiece of hundreds of events, some of them exercises in rebranding (the Scottish FA Cup is to be known as the Homecoming Scottish Cup) but many others specially devised to grip the imagination of embryonic Donald Trumps everywhere. Whisky and golf feature prominently. Edinburgh will host the biggest ever Highland games and a great gathering of clan societies in July (""visit the clan tents and find out more about your family""). Displays of Scottish scientific and technical achievement will demonstrate why 11% of Nobel prizes have been won by Scots or by people of ""directly Scottish descent"". (I merely quote the website. Figures from the Nobel committee suggest that 14% of the prizes have been shared among 114 UK residents, only a handful of them born in Scotland.) Such official tubthumping about the genius of the national gene would now be unthinkable - and unbearable - in England. Perhaps small countries, especially those with big neighbours, can be excused because they need to shout louder. But how witless Scotland becomes in this mood, how keen to fall back on an identity that has been primarily created by two centuries of tourism. I didn't expect to see social realism in a one-minute commercial for Scotland - obesity figures, heart-attack rates - but still I watched it with a bewildered shame. Its nine scenes comprise two castles, a glen, a statue of Burns, an empty and beautiful Highland beach, a whisky distillery, a golf course and, in a touch of the modern, Glasgow's Science Centre. Celebrity Scots stand before each scene and each sings a line or two from a plaintive song, Caledonia, which was once used to sell Tennent's lager.  Sean Connery speaks his lines rather than sings. ""Let me tell you that I love you,"" he says of the country he left many years ago for the low-tax hardship of the Bahamas, continuing to camera with a perfectly straight face, ""and I think about you all the time"". And then Lulu ends with the chorus: ""Caledonia, you're calling me and now I'm going home. And if I should become a stranger, you know it would make me more than sad. Caledonia's been everything I've ever had."" Whether viewers in England will see the commercial has still to be decided. More diasporic Scots probably live there than in any other country, even Canada; but, as Lulu should know, the act of ""going home"" returns us quickly to a hard-edged Scottish particularity rather than a sticky Caledonian mess. The signs of welcome at the border on the M74 may be bigger and brighter, and newly translated into Gaelic, but at least in our car the cry of ""We're in Scotland, hurray!"" is quickly followed by ""And there's the Ralph Lauren retail outlet at Gretna Green!"" We can't be sold castles. The idea of clan rallies, of people making common cause because they share the same surname (""We're the Orange County McGregors. And you guys?""), strikes us as pointless and feudal. The targeted audience, to be reached by YouTube and selective emailing, lies overseas. There are many millions of them; however much popular history may have distorted the reasons for Scottish emigration - the Highland clearances get the most frequent mention - the sheer number of emigrants is hard to exaggerate. According to the historian TM Devine, more than 2 million sailed from Scotland, mainly for North America and Australasia, between the 1820s and 1914, followed by another surge in the 1920s. Countries such as Italy and Spain recorded much higher absolute numbers, but in per-head terms Scotland, Ireland and Norway led the European emigration league table for most of the period. As Professor Devine points out, only a small minority were Highland crofters forced from their land. Most came from the Lowlands and left willingly. As Scotland was then at the height of its Victorian prosperity and actually importing labour, the question arises over why so many Scots wanted to leave. At least part of the answer has to be better prospects, often on land stolen from the native populations of Ontario and New South Wales. These then were the ambitious people who sailed down the Clyde. Caledonia was not to be ""everything they ever had"". Instead it became their own little lantern show of memories, which for decades did more to inflect notions of Scottish identity with a kind of ornamental melancholy than any careful inspection of the territory itself. On Canada Hill, relatives waved farewell to generations of young men who were steaming optimistically through the mist and wanting to get on.",Ian Jack: Scotland's search for tourists has become witless,2009-01-03T00:01:00Z,Ian Jack,uk
"Who did you see racing from home over the holiday to keep Britain at work? Bankers? You must be joking. Bankers were feathering their balance sheets with £50bn in real money given them by Gordon Brown as a reward for their antics in 2008. The people who were rescuing the economy were consumers spending what little money the government had left them. They packed supermarkets, malls, high streets and eBay websites, helping keep the retail sector, its suppliers and thus the economy going. The government has now allocated to the banks the equivalent of £1,000 from every man, woman and child in Britain. This was supposedly to ""maintain confidence"" and thus continue the flow of lending. The flow has not occurred. It must be the most costly single failure of policy in peacetime. Yet the cry from politicians and the financial press is for more. Economic policy has not progressed beyond the Somme. Banks are not lending for a simple reason. As demand plummets and unemployment soars - by a predicted one million next year - there are no good debts to be found. Bankers have been pilloried by ministers all autumn for recklessly incurring bad debts, mostly to first-time housebuyers at the bidding of those same ministers. They are disinclined to make that mistake again. Attacking banks is satisfying and makes good copy, but they are behaving predictably. They are using the Treasury's largesse, which means our taxes, to bind up their bruised balance sheets and not incur bad debts at the start of a recession. They are saving. When there was a chance of propping up confidence, there was a case for helping banks. Now the Treasury is throwing good money after bad. It is taxing and saving, the daftest policy in a recession. If 2008 was the year of the bank, 2009 should be the year of the consumer. The recovery should be ""kick-started"" by boosting spending, not saving, and the people best qualified to spend are spenders. Over the holiday millions showed how. They went out and bought goods and services in the marketplace. They helped keep desperate shops, pubs, garages and hotels in business, and thus also their employees and suppliers. Earlier this month I suggested simply giving the lavish sums being expended on banks back to consumers in the form of three-month spending coupons, say of £300 a month. The proposal is being actively considered to boost demand in Germany, Taiwan, Australia and elsewhere. It is better than VAT reductions, tax credits or ponderous public works contracts in instantaneously translating subsidy into demand. At the very least it puts money into the economy rather than taking it out, as do Alastair Darling's banking subsidies. The proposal's critics fell back unerringly on Britain's patrician tradition of economic control. Giving people (their own) money was vulgar. It should be laundered through those who knew about such things, such as policymakers and banks. Most people would spend on fripperies rather than noble manufactures. They would buy imports, get drunk, indulge in leisure, Starbucks and hairdressing. Even if the vouchers were not cashable, people might sell them in the grey market to help to pay their mortgages (just what banks are doing with the same money). None of these possible consequences is economically damaging and all would stimulate demand. All would leave the public rather than the Treasury to spend the way out of recession, on the assumption it will do it quicker and more wisely. Why tax people to build cars they do not want, rather than giving them money to buy cars they do? There is nothing wrong in buying imports during a world recession. There is no shame in services and leisure, which are labour intensive and thus important at a time of rising unemployment. There is no guilt in shopping. Retailing, like tourism, underpins demand. The truth is that ministers are letting small businesses fail because these are run by people they do not know. What friend of the secretary of state for business, Lord Mandelson, ever owned a corner shop? Economic policy has long been distorted by favour and prejudice. Reckless lending to poor housebuyers was good when it bought Blair and Brown votes. Now rising debt has made it bad. Helping big projects like the Olympics is good because it offers photo-opportunities, but helping leisure services is what John Prescott called ""Mickey Mouse economics"". Labour economic policy enters 2009 in the mode adopted by Margaret Thatcher and Geoffrey Howe in the recession of 1981-2. It is turning the recessionary screw and suppressing demand just when the economy appears to need a boost. (Yet where are 1981's 365 economists writing to the Times to protest?) Thatcher and Howe at least had excuses - inflation was already at double figures and British industry was chronically in need of restructuring. Brown and Darling are sucking the private sector dry just when it most needs moisture. They are protecting public sector pensions, raising the minimum wage and giving banks stupefying amounts of public money, knowing that this money is being withdrawn from circulation and will be saved, not spent. If there is one sentiment that should have died in 2008 it is faith in the collective intelligence of Whitehall. The economic forecasters league table for 2008 was published last week and, of the 42 pundits listed, no public authority was in the top half. The Treasury came in at 37th and the IMF was bottom. This is the mob that brought us City deregulation and the house-price bubble. Yet I doubt if a single one has been upbraided, let alone sacked. The entire Bank of England monetary policy committee is still in office - except for the only one who called the recession correctly, David Blanchflower, who has mysteriously been stood down. This is not some City luncheon parlour game. As a result of the arrogance of these economic managers, a million people will lose their jobs next year and tens of thousands their houses. Yet all they think to do, egged on by politicians, is take more money from spenders and give it to savers, to their beloved City banks. Banking is a profession that excels at making money for itself. For 10 years it mesmerised Blair and Brown, who showered it with tax loopholes, offshore profits, PFI contracts and vacuous government consultancies. Ministers and bankers enjoyed a revolving Whitehall door. Frustrated ministers are still expecting the City to rescue the economy in 2009, continuing to trust it with the public's money to an extent that they will not trust the public. They seem unaware that bankers do not rescue economies. They rescue banks. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com",Simon Jenkins: In banks we trust should not be the mantra for 2009,2008-12-31T00:01:00Z,Simon Jenkins,politics
"Could there be a greater corporate disaster in British history than the humbling of the Royal Bank of Scotland? Without £20bn of taxpayer support, the bank, with assets of £1.7 trillion, more than Britain's GDP, would now be bankrupt. Its mutation from bank to de facto giant hedge fund, cheerleader for casino capitalism with a portfolio of £500bn in derivatives and £100bn of takeovers in its wake, perfectly sums up our times.  The financial wreckage it has induced explains why the wider economy is in such trouble. There were many other asinine banks, but RBS was leader of the pack. News that it had lent the hedge funds of the now disgraced American fraudster Bernie Madoff £400m with insufficient due diligence was symptomatic of the failure of every aspect of RBS's corporate strategy.  Sir Fred Goodwin, the now deposed CEO, and his team should be asked hard questions by both shareholders and the police. So should the outgoing management at sister Scottish bank HBOS, whose incompetence rivals Goodwin's. The former RBS chief has rightly been dubbed the world's worst banker by Slate magazine's Daniel Gross. For a decade, British banks had grown fat on what seemed an inexhaustible supply of cash from London's deep, wide market in money, succoured by savings from all over the world, and bet it on an increasingly complex and fantastical array of financial products hatched in the financial shadows.  The first crack showed when Northern Rock could no longer borrow in the interbank market in the summer of 2007 because others doubted its creditworthiness. After five months of government dithering, it was nationalised. But over 2008, the cracks widened into a fissure, so that following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September, only the finest names in world banking could tap the New York and London markets. Vast loans could not be refinanced, let alone new ones made and as property values tumbled, the collateral against which the loans had been secured evaporated.  It looked like 1929 all over again, except governments, especially in Britain and America, were determined not to repeat mistakes made following the Great Crash. The Bush administration had already put aside its ideological commitment to non-intervention in a range of responses, nationalising the US's two giant mortgage companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, then launching a $700bn programme to buy toxic loans and aggressively cutting interest rates. But still the system tottered.  It was Gordon Brown who, over the weekend of 11-12 October, emerged as the world leader with a viable plan to head off what might have been the collapse of the western banking system. The response hatched in London - three pronged but centred on recapitalising the banks with taxpayers' money - became the model that the rest of the world copied. Brown sold it first to the Americans and then the Europeans.  It was a tour de force. It staved off immediate disaster. Brown's self-confidence, which had been wilting ever since he ducked calling an election a year earlier, suddenly revived. His government had a purpose: to manage Britain through the worst financial crisis since the 1930s. Labour's philosophy in favour of government activism, never wholly abandoned, was right for new times. It could not be clearer that markets were inefficient, made horrendous mistakes and needed governments; the philosophy that argued otherwise was bust. The public noticed and Labour's opinion poll ratings climbed out of the abyss.Yet he is travelling in uncharted waters. The International Monetary Fund has warned that recessions caused by financial crises are longer and deeper than others. The banking system in Britain and elsewhere may be saved, but the interbank markets on which lending depends remain broken. Banks do not have cash, their capital is under pressure and their borrowers are distressed, hardly a recipe to increase bank lending to stimulate recovery. Germany, Japan and the US are predicting a grim recessionary year in 2009; the Treasury forecast of a mere 1% decline in British GDP seems incredible.  The government's Plan A is that the combination of the fall in interest rates to 2%, the sharp fall in the pound and Brown and Darling's £20bn package - together with Barack Obama's stimulus package - will see off the worst of the recession. Critics, ranging from the Archbishop of Canterbury to the German finance minister, strongly differ. They say that lifting government borrowing to finance consumer spending only repeats the bad habits that got us into crisis, whose moral roots are unaddressed. It won't work. These critics are wrong. The criticism of Brown and Darling should be not that they are Keynesian, it is that they are not radically Keynesian enough. They only understood the severity of the crisis too late, disbelieving that markets could make such enormous mistakes. They were too slow to nationalise Northern Rock. They should have introduced the package of schemes to make lending less risky not next month but last spring, as I and others argued. They have allowed the governor of the Bank of England to be too conservative and restrictive on the terms the Bank supplies cash. They have not urged police investigations into senior bankers, so vital for our collective sense that justice is being done, nor quickly introduced the tougher regulatory regime for which many seasoned bankers (privately) beg. They do not propose root-and-branch reform of the City. The terms of the bank rescue plan were far too penal. As a result, Britain is much less well placed than it should be.  At a secret meeting at Number 10 before Christmas, the prime minister, chancellor, governor of the Bank of England and head of the Financial Services Authority reviewed the prospects. London's interbank markets are short of up to a trillion pounds and remain crippled. Unless the Bank of England finds a trillion to plug the gap, the continuing failure of banks to lend could bring on a recession more acute than the America's. Measures that might have worked last year will now work much less effectively. Chances are being lost. As one official argued, Britain must go straight to so-called ""helicopter money"". Essentially, the government has to instruct the Bank of England to lend the banking system cash the Royal Mint has printed.  The case was given a hearing, but ruled out. The risk of a calamitous run on sterling is too high. The cautious view was that printing money was a last-ditch measure; everything else must be tried first. The problem is that the chance of the current measures working hangs in the balance. If the government moves to radical Keynesianism - reconstructing and restructuring the financial system - it is possible that it might avert the need for helicopter money. It needs to develop policies that will assure us all that capitalism will be arranged more fairly in future. That would be crucial to lifting depressed expectations. There are many civil servants and senior financiers who are desperate that we are still in mainstream Keynesianism, however well-intentioned and even aggressive it is. This is a time for outside-the-box thinking. For in one respect, the arguments made by the Archbishop of Canterbury are right. People everywhere are taking stock. The last decade and its values have ended in disaster, in potential depression. Everybody knows that we cannot go back. The bankers responsible must be held to account. Capitalism has to be done differently, both here and abroad. It has to be fairer. It has to comprehend that enterprise is a collective as much as an individual endeavour. It cannot just be based on ""fairy money"". Recovery will require radical Keynesianism. It also needs a moral vision.",Will Hutton: We need a moral vision as well as money to rebuild Britain,2008-12-28T00:01:00Z,Will Hutton,politics
"'Tis the night before Christmas and the season of goodwill. The mood is forgiving. Our faces warm with mulled wine, our tummies full, we're meant to slump in the armchair, look back on the year just gone and count our blessings - woozily agreeing to put our troubles behind us. As in families, so in the realm of public and international affairs. And this December that feels especially true. The ""war on terror"" that dominated much of the decade seems to be heading towards a kind of conclusion. George Bush will leave office in a matter of weeks and British troops will leave Iraq a few months later. The first, defining phase of the conflict that began on 9/11 - the war of Bush, Tony Blair and Osama bin Laden - is about to slip from the present to the past tense. Bush and Blair will be gone, with only Bin Laden still in post. The urge to move on is palpable. You can sense it in the valedictory interviews Bush and Dick Cheney are conducting on their way out. They're looking to the verdict of history now, Cheney telling the Washington Times last week: ""I myself am personally persuaded that this president and this administration will look very good 20 or 30 years down the road."" The once raging arguments of the current era are about to fade, the lead US protagonists heading off to their respective ranches in the west, the rights and wrongs of their decisions in office to be weighed not in the hot arena of politics, but in the cool seminar rooms of the academy. Not so fast. Yes, the new year would get off to a more soothing start if we could all agree to draw a line and move on. But it would be wrong. First, because we cannot hope to avoid repeating the errors of the last eight years unless they are subject to a full accounting. (It is for that reason Britain needs its own full, unconstrained inquiry into the Iraq war.) Second, because a crucial principle, one that goes to the very heart of the American creed, is at stake. And third, because this is not solely about the judgment of history. It may be about the judgment of the courts - specifically those charged with punishing war crimes. Less than a fortnight ago, in the news graveyard of a Friday afternoon, the armed services committee of the US Senate released a bipartisan report - with none other than John McCain as its co-author - into the American use of torture against those held in the war on terror. It dismissed entirely the notion that the horrors of Abu Ghraib could be put down to ""a few bad apples"". Instead it laid bare, in forensic detail, the trail of memos and instructions that led directly to the then defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld. The report was the fruit of 18 months of work, involving some 70 interviews. Most of it is classified, but even the 29-page published summary makes horrifying reading. It shows how the most senior figures in the Bush administration discussed, and sought legal fig leaves for, practices that plainly amounted to torture. They were techniques devised in a training programme known as Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape or SERE, that aimed to teach elite American soldiers how to endure torture should they fall into the hands of pitiless enemies. The SERE techniques were partly modelled on the brutal methods used by the Chinese against US prisoners during the Korean war. Yet Rumsfeld ruled that these same techniques should be ""reverse engineered"", so that Americans would learn not how to endure them - but how to inflict them. Which they then did, at Guantánamo, Abu Ghraib and beyond. The Senate report cites the memorandums requesting permission to use ""stress positions, exploitation of detainee fears (such as fear of dogs), removal of clothing, hooding, deprivation of light and sound, and the so-called wet towel treatment or the waterboard"". We read of Mohamed al Kahtani - against whom all charges were dropped earlier this year - who was ""deprived of adequate sleep for weeks on end, stripped naked, subjected to loud music, and made to wear a leash and perform dog tricks"". Approval for this kind of torture, hidden under the euphemism of ""enhanced interrogation"", was sought from and granted at the highest level.  And that doesn't mean Rumsfeld. The report's first conclusion is that, on ""7 February 2002, President George W Bush made a written determination that Common Article 3 of the Geneva conventions, which would have afforded minimum standards for humane treatment, did not apply to al-Qaida or Taliban detainees"". The result, it says, is that Bush ""opened the door"" to the use of a raft of techniques that the US had once branded barbaric and beyond the realm of human decency.  For this Bush should surely be held to account. And yet there is no sign that he will, and precious little agitation that he should. A still smiling Cheney denies the Bush administration did anything wrong. Note this breathtaking exchange with Fox News at the weekend. He was asked: ""If the president during war decides to do something to protect the country, is it legal?"" Cheney's answer: ""General proposition, I'd say yes.""  It takes a few seconds for the full horror of that remark to sink in. And then you remember where you last heard something like it. It was the now immortalised interview between David Frost and Richard Nixon. The disgraced ex-president was asked whether there were certain situations where the president can do something illegal, if he deems it in the national interest. Nixon's reply: ""Well, when the president does it, that means that it is not illegal."" It is no coincidence that Cheney began his career in the Nixon White House. He has the same Nixonian disregard for the US constitution, the same belief that executive power is absolute and unlimited - that those who wield it are above the law, domestic and international. It is the logic of dictatorship.  But Nixon was forced from office, his vision of an unrestrained presidency rejected. If Bush and Cheney are allowed to retire quietly, America will have failed to reassert that bedrock principle of the republic: the rule of law.  This is why there must be a reckoning. Bush will do all he can to avoid it: and it is wholly possible that one of his last acts as president will be to cover himself, his vice-president and all his henchmen with a blanket pardon. Even if that does not happen, Barack Obama is unlikely to want to spend precious capital pursuing his predecessor for war crimes.  But other prosecutors elsewhere in the world should weigh their responsibilities. In the end, it was a lone Spanish magistrate, not a Chilean court, who ensured the arrest of Augusto Pinochet. A pleasing, if uncharitable, thought this Christmas, is that Rumsfeld, Cheney and Bush will hesitate before making plans to travel abroad in 2009. Or indeed at any time - ever again. freedland@theguardian.com",Jonathan Freedland: Seasonal forgiveness has a limit.

"If a year of government bail-outs has taught us anything, it is not to rush to judgment. In fact, the more a bail-out might look, from the lay point of view, like a case of using public money to reward greed, to subsidise folly and to extend public charity to the gittish and depraved, the more likely, one gathers, it is to be vital to the national interest.  Moreover, we've learnt, no matter how bitterly one might resent being made to rescue the career of an undeserving banker, it is important to remember the extent of human woe if this repulsive individual were to be abandoned to market forces. What of the blameless drone who sluices out his office, makes his lunch, or sells him his home cinema, his lap-dance, his ski trip, third home and boating holiday on Corfu's idyllic, if shyster-infested shores? Who else will fund his wife's continued acquisition of new watches, kitchens, shoes, jewellery, handbags and all the other luxury goods which, according to that trusted distillation of high net-worth values, the FT's How to Spend It magazine, are what gives life its meaning?  ""Do we really want a world without fine food?"" demands a shopping expert in the current issue. ""A world without beautifully blown glass, delicate porcelain and leading-edge technology? If nobody buys these things, then that is the future that awaits us."" A sentiment which Peter Mandelson, the business secretary, seemed to echo, when he spoke, last week, about British expertise in making internal combustion engines being a precious ""centre of real excellence"". In the same way, presumably, that we were once very good with horses.  So, when assessing the plight of Jaguar Land Rover we should ask ourselves - once we've thought about all the poor workers - whether we want to live in a world without the 4.2 litre V8 petrol supercharged Jaguar which emits 299g of CO2 per kilometre: ""True to our heritage,"" say the makers, ""we've used the most luxurious materials and insisted on exquisite attention to every detail."" To say nothing of a world without the Land Rover Defender SVX (291g/km) which went into production earlier this year with a breathtaking indifference towards cultural, as well as climate change, long after such vehicles had been nicknamed Chelsea tractors, and their urban use by anyone who could afford to do otherwise widely agreed to be an a unerring marker of the driver's selfishness and vacuity. Recently, in fact, it has been hard to conceive of the city dweller, beyond the target readership of How to Spend It, the flashier kind of drug dealer, and noted SUV fans Jon Gaunt and Zara Phillips, who would regard ownership of so ostentatiously inconsiderate a vehicle as anything other than an embarrassment.  All of which, if we were not now accustomed to the counterintuitive nature of public bail-outs, would make the prospect of state intervention to save Jaguar Land Rover look very capricious indeed. Why should public money be used to protect an incipiently archaic business which, iconic or not, is run by India's Mr Tata? Who, though he may be concerned about manufacturing jobs in the Midlands, has just agreed to slosh some of his corporation's vast profits in the direction of Ferrari's Formula One team? Which, with our date with peak oil now fixed for 2020, would appear to be almost as unedifying a use of cash as would be our own, to guarantee the continued production of Land Rovers and Jaguars. We know better, after the rescue of our still unreformed banks, than to expect the government to demand improved standards of competence and responsibility in exchange for civic support. On the plus side, if Mandelson does elect to save a foreign-owned company whose design geniuses didn't have the sense to plan for greener times while they continued to flog some of the most preposterously antisocial vehicles ever made to the sort of customers who are beguiled by the ""brand ambassador"" Zara Phillips's very special, horse-scented cachet, this will be cheerful news for other specialists in iconic, yet downturn-threatened products. Simply because it is taking a while for the ethically challenged, How to Spend It audience to comprehend that it is possible for a handbag to cost too much does not mean this will never happen. Already, it's reported, some accessory buyers are insisting that these and other trophies from the luxury goods market be sent to them, like embarrassing pharmaceuticals, under plain cover.  But nothing is certain and anyone who read Mr Mandelson's recent speech about his dashing new philosophy of ""industrial activism"" will appreciate the stringent analysis to which the billionaire Mr Tata's recent, but apparently cash-strapped acquisitions will be subjected before he is judged to have earned our charity. A ""total business environment approach"" will establish that, in requiring taxpayers to help support this most piteous of plutocrats, the state is not embarking on the unthinkable: ""propping up unviable companies"" or ""backing away from free trade or open markets or the discipline of competition"".  Insofar as a lay person can hope to master the complexities of industrial activism, then, one gathers that what would be offered to Mr Tata could be more aptly compared with ""lending him a tenner"", in order to ""tide him over"", until he receives a generous postal order from some long-dead aunt.  Why Jaguar Land Rover and not, say, Woolworths or MFI? Maybe, as they like to say aboard the good ship Deripaska, if you have to ask, you'll never know. But obviously, the reasons for Mandelson's perceived preference must go way beyond crude comparisons relating to job numbers, core manufacturing, technology, electoral advantage, unhygienically displayed confectionery, the peculiar needs of male, as opposed to female workers, and a company's ability, as a ruthless Mandelson hunkily put it this week, to ""march forward with the times"". That would be the times in which, although people still like buying sweets and cheap stuff, gas-guzzling cars have been doomed for years by the advance of the EU's emissions-cutting legislation. If rationality or fairness or morality had anything to do with it, Mandelson could never have contemplated rescuing this unenlightened outpost of Mr Tata's empire, with its unfortunate signal to similarly expectant foreign corporations. In the context of his promised ""green industrial revolution"", the proposal is comical. Which is not to say Jaguar Land Rover's workers deserve to be abandoned by the government, like the unfortunate staff of Woolworths. In the unlikely event of the brand's collapse, public money may be used, instead, to train its former workers to make sustainable vehicles: the recession's long-awaited green dividend.  Since we cannot know what is coming next, it would be reckless to call this potentially iconic bail-out the most absurd and insulting of the lot. This week, for all we know, Mandelson will propose extending public assistance to Tatler magazine, to Smythson, to struggling purveyors of beautifully blown glass.  And why not, if these are the sort of things, unlike sweets from Woollies, that appeal to the high-end shopper? What is the point, Lord Peter might reasonably ask, of going to all the trouble of saving a banker, then denying him the very stuff he wants to buy?",Catherine Bennett: So is this really the great new idea - saving the gas-guzzler?,2008-12-21T00:01:00Z,Catherine Bennett,politics
"Almost since they began, feature films have carried tag lines after their titles. Most have been forgotten (The Third Man: ""Hunted by men ... sought by women!"") and only a few remembered for their comedy (A Fish Called Wanda: ""A tale of murder, lust, greed, revenge, and seafood""). More recent tag lines have favoured the question over the statement, a question usually general enough to apply to all young humankind (""Can two friends sleep together and still love each other in the morning?"") and in the film's trailer spoken so gravely as if it had baffled all philosophy since the Greeks. The tag line to Revolutionary Road is: ""How do you break free ... without breaking apart?""  Revolutionary Road opens in the US on Boxing Day and in Britain next month, already replete with Golden Globe nominations for its director, Sam Mendes, and its stars, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. I haven't seen the film, but to judge from reports its story remains faithful to the novel of the same name by Richard Yates. A young couple are having a troubled marriage. In the trailer, their house looks pretty much as the book describes: wooden, white and ""perky"" at the top of a sloping lawn. Period detail is important. People are drinking triangular cocktails, smoking, and walking down the platform at New York's Grand Central terminus in front of railroad cars that a keen eye can detect are square and riveted (only some of us will notice, but it matters). In other words, this is America of 50 years ago. Men in suits commute to offices in the city, women keep house in the suburbs, everybody smokes and drinks way too much. Lung cancer, cirrhosis, Vietnam, feminism, civil rights, Kennedy's assassination, the waning of American power: all are just around the corner waiting in their black hoods, and perhaps for that reason New York in 1955 - white, male and confident - has the fascination of a somewhat repellent golden age.  Convention is the oppressor here, and Revolutionary Road is just one of many films to suggest the suburb as convention's leading enforcer - what Frank and April Wheeler (DiCaprio and Winslet) feel the need to ""break free"" from. To live in a suburb, to be ""suburban"": these may be pejorative words across the western world, but nowhere have they been pronounced more fiercely than in the world's most suburbanised country, the US. In Britain, the usual adjective was ""leafy"". In America, the adjectives were different: sterile, monotonous, illiberal, consumerist, bourgeois. Could any other society have tolerated a song so inflamed with sanctimony as Pete Seeger's Little Boxes - made of ""ticky-tacky"" as I remember - where everybody thought and behaved alike, which is to say unlike Pete and what in 1963 had still to be known as the counterculture.  Yates's novel was published in 1961, just in time to catch a swelling tide of suburban loathing. In the same year, Lewis Mumford published his great work The City in History, the most profound examination of metropolitan success and failure. In it he attacked ""the absurd belief that space and rapid locomotion are the chief ingredients of a good life"" that had been fostered ""by the agents of mass suburbia"". The result for the commuter, Mumford wrote, was ""an encapsulated life, spent more and more either in a motor car or within the cabin of darkness before a television set"". Two years later Betty Friedan, in her best-selling polemic The Feminist Mystique, portrayed the non-commuting woman as the bigger victim, young suburban housewives ""kissing their husbands goodbye in front of the picture window, depositing their station wagon full of children at the school, and smiling as they ran the new electric waxer over the spotless floor"". So the suburb was villainous in every way, aesthetically, morally, socially, trapping women into isolated, unfulfilled lives and men into two-hour commutes. No wonder that Yates, whose novel can seem to endorse these attitudes was enlisted as a fighter in the cause. The question used to bug him, as it often bugs writers when readers mistake their description of human particulars for a sociological attack. ""The Wheelers may have thought the suburbs were to blame for all their problems,"" he once said in irritation, ""but I meant it to be implicit in the text that is was their delusion, their problem, not mine."" And, looking at the neat little white house in the film, what's not to like? It's probably in Connecticut and rather like the various houses where Yates toiled over his novel for five years, a manic-depressive alcoholic who got through four packs of cigarettes a day, his lungs punctured and his mornings a painful clamour of hacking and vomiting; forever, according to his biographer Blake Bailey, ""a slow, insecure writer with a wildly inflated idea of what he'd missed by way of college."" Neat little houses can contain all kinds of lives. The notion that suburbs smooth the edges of different kinds of personality to produce similar people is persistent but it should be insufferable to us, because in one way or another so many of us are suburbanites now and in the American rather than British sense.  In history, the British suburb grew where the tramline ended or the train stopped. America was no different at first, but in the 1920s the electric grid, the Model T Ford and cheap petrol produced a huge expansion, which was brought to an end by the mortgage foreclosures of the Great Crash, and then redoubled after the second world war. Every GI was promised the chance of a free college education and a 100% loan to buy his own home. To meet the demand, houses were mass-produced as models rather like cars: the Cape Cod, the Ranch. As early as the late 1940s, each came equipped with a TV. Swathes of farmland vanished under their curvilinear streets. Here a new kind of civilisation grew. Residents didn't know or care how their neighbours earned a living; the office and factory were far away. A history of the American suburbs, Picture Windows by Rosalyn Baxandall and Elizabeth Ewen summarises it like this: ""It was what one consumed - rather than what one produced - that was important.""  The social informality of such places was amazing - the barbecues, the Tupperware parties, the fast food, the casual clothes. ""Slacks or shorts are standard wear for both men and women at all times,"" Harper's magazine reported with a sense of discovery in 1953. The city, the 'urb in the equation, grew less important as a destination. Shopping malls replaced downtown department stores. The suburbs became self-contained, with every need met apart perhaps from decent public transport, high culture, and the rewards of good architecture.  How do you break free? Most people didn't. A comfortable but flawed way of living, dependent on everlastingly cheap oil, has been exported to many parts of the world, to India and China as well as Hertfordshire and Essex. It may now be doomed, but when we watch Revolutionary Road or read Yates's fine novel, we see the origins of our present lifestyle, as yet only marginally altered by a healthy disregard for tobacco and strong liquor and in the long, sustainable term still villainous.",Ian Jack: We are all suburban now,2008-12-20T00:01:00Z,Ian Jack,society
"Forget the two-state solution: start thinking about the four-state problem. The phrase comes from Palestinian negotiator and analyst Ahmad Khalidi, who has toiled for decades to see two states side by side, one for Palestinians, the other for Israelis. Now, though, he sees one strong state, Israel, surrounded by three statelets. The first is the West Bank, ruled by the secular nationalists of Fatah. The second is Gaza, for nearly two years the fiefdom of Islamist Hamas. The third is the surprise: still in embryo, we got a glimpse of its future earlier this month.  Militant Jewish settlers in Hebron resisted their eviction from a disputed house by not only hurling stones and debris at Palestinians nearby - and daubing black stars of David on Muslim gravestones in what Israel's prime minister Ehud Olmert called a ""pogrom"" - but also by turning their fire on the soldiers of the Israel Defence Forces. These images were a shock to the Israeli system, confirmation that a hard core of Jewish settlers now exists that has next to no loyalty to the state of Israel, and that indeed regards the state as godless and illegitimate - and which is prepared to raise its hand to the teenage men and women who comprise the bulk of Israel's conscript army. Soon we might speak of Israel, the West Bank, Gaza and a new, zealous, rebel entity: call it Judea.  We are not quite at that point yet. But add it to the long list of developments causing veterans of the Middle East peace process - a saga so long-running that it's the Mousetrap of international negotiations - to lose faith in the two-state solution, even as that model enjoys near global support among the world's governments, restated again yesterday, whether at the United Nations security council or at Olmert's meeting in London with Gordon Brown.  The causes for despair are numerous, starting with that fragmentation cited by Khalidi. Palestinians who once believed the split between Fatah and Hamas was transient and reparable now worry the division is hardening, that there is no figure on the horizon capable of putting this sundered people back together. They ask why Hamas would come back under the authority of Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas. What would be in it for them? And yet so long as the Palestinians remain divided, Abbas is too weak to do a meaningful deal with Israel, one that would bind all Palestinians. Indeed, conversations with those on both sides in the last week have told a remarkably similar story: neither Israelis nor Palestinians believe they are capable of reaching an agreement.  The mood is hardly conducive. A month-long blockade of Gaza, with Palestinians there denied access to fuel, medical equipment and much else, may not have garnered a great deal of attention here but the rising human cost, of sick patients and darkened schools, is a staple of the nightly news on television around the Arab world. The anger is directed mostly at Israel, for enforcing the sanctions, imposed in response to the discovery of secret tunnels into Israel from Gaza. But Egypt is blamed too, for failing to open its border, thereby bringing respite to those in desperate need - as are the European Union and the US, both of which are party to the embargo of Hamas. On Friday, Hamas's six month-long ceasefire, which has mainly held, will expire. Few would bet on it being extended.  Meanwhile, Abbas faces an expiration date of his own: his presidential term runs out on 9 January. He is hinting that he will step aside, allowing elections for a new leader. Even those unimpressed by Abbas - by his remoteness, his inability to act as a unifying, national figure - see his departure as an invitation for more division and paralysis. The stalemate has roots on the other side, too. Olmert's time is also running out; Israel will have new elections on 10 February. Polls predict a return to power for Binyamin Netanyahu and Likud, whose defining trait is a nationalistic scepticism about the peace process. Even if that were to be overcome, Israel has its own inbuilt divisions, expressed in coalitions perennially too fragmented to make the concessions that have to be made.  Besides, there are plenty in Israel's policy establishment who think the status quo is bearable, that Palestinians pose nothing like the existential threat of, say, a nuclear Iran. They're happy enough to have a process but are not really serious about peace. As I heard one senior Israeli official put it recently: ""Negotiations are good, results are bad."" Some respond to this bleak landscape by focusing on individual elements within it and imagining how they might be improved. Maybe new Palestinian elections would produce a useful outcome. After all, the latest survey from pollster Khalil Shikaki has Fatah leading Hamas by 42% to 28% - with Fatah polling especially strongly on Hamas's turf in Gaza. Or perhaps Netanyahu will follow the Nixon-to-China principle and, as a man of the right, do the deal. After all, when he last served as PM a decade ago, he proved to be more pragmatic than his reputation had suggested. Or there will be a miracle and the new, dovish party founded by former Camp David negotiator Gilead Sher, and backed by literary giants Amos Oz and David Grossman, will sweep to unexpected victory.  Dream on. Rather than hoping the factors thwarting a two-state solution might change, it is surely more rational to step back and rethink the entire approach. Britain's foreign secretary, David Miliband, is fond of quoting Eisenhower's maxim that, when faced with an intractable problem, the first move is to make it bigger. Frustrated by the impossibility of making peace between two peoples, why not up the ante and seek to make peace between Israel and the entire region? A comprehensive peace or, as Miliband put it in a speech last month, ""a 23-state solution - 22 members of the Arab League plus Israel"". This is not as fanciful as it might seem. The Arab peace initiative of 2002, which offered full normalisation of relations in return for Israel's withdrawal to its 1967 borders, is still on the table. Indeed the Arab League wrote to Barack Obama just last week, urging him to work for Middle East peace, with their initiative as the basis.  There are problems with the Arab plan. For one thing, there has been no public diplomacy for it, no public face for it - no equivalent of Anwar Sadat's breakthrough visit to Israel, proving the sincerity of his desire for peace. And how would it work in practice? Khalidi wonders how on earth 22 Arab countries are meant to reach ""simultaneous orgasm"", coming to an agreement with Israel all at the same time.  And yet the logic behind it is compelling. Right now, the Palestinians don't have enough to offer Israel to make the sacrifices required for a peace deal worthwhile. But an accord with the entire Arab world, that would be a prize worth bending for. And, while today's Palestinian leadership is too weak to make compromises on, for instance, Jerusalem, united Arab support would give the Palestinians all the cover they need.  Fear of Iran might motivate the Arabs to come together. A falling oil price could concentrate the mind too. And as always, the sine qua non is the active intervention of the US. Some Israeli officials believe that, after the Bush era, the US is no longer capable of imposing its will on the Middle East. Starting next month, President Obama will have a chance to prove them wrong - and solve one of the world's most persistent problems into the bargain.  freedland@theguardian.com",Jonathan Freedland: An accord with the entire Arab world would be a prize worth Israel's effort,2008-12-17T00:01:00Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"Only very recently have the scars begun to fade. Yet the memory of the insult will never entirely disappear and the trust a nation once had in the British Broadcasting Corporation will never fully be restored. It was the year Jocky Wilson was cheated out of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award. By any moral indicator, the little silver camera should have gone to Fife's fearless fury in 1982. Jocky had triumphed in a memorable World Darts final against Gentleman John Lowe and the whole of Scotland rejoiced. Here at last was a sporting hero the nation could identify with. As long in inches as he was wide, and with teeth merely a memory, he could have enjoyed a lucrative stage career as Wee Jimmy Crankie's older brother. Nobly, he forsook the allure of greasepaint and sought glory for Scotland on an 8ft wooden battlefield; his weapons three unerring arrows, his quarry a mosaic of black and gold cork. As Jocky wrestled with numbers and the inflamed expectations of an unpredictable audience on his lonely walks each night to the oche, he single-handedly helped to alter a nation's drinking habits. Thousands of Scottish males who had last seen exercise by invading Wembley or Hampden were compelled to follow Jocky's example and walk about a bit at their local as they visited the dartboard back and forth, back and forth to retrieve their arrows. Yet the British public still insisted on giving the 1982 award to someone called Daley Thompson. Daley who? Tonight though, 26 years of pain can be erased if the BBC and the viewers of sturdy middle England do the just thing and crown Chris Hoy 2008's sports personality. Of course many will point to Liz McColgan's triumph in 1991 and exclaim: 'Where's your anti-Scottish theory now?' But how could anyone not have voted for that flame-haired goddess of the track? Hoy, Britain's greatest modern Olympian, by dint of his three golds at Beijing, should win by several lengths of a cycling track. Yet this has been a strong year for British sport and Hoy will be pushed all the way by Rebecca Adlington, that sweet Nottinghamshire lass who won two golds in China. Lewis Hamilton and Andy Murray will also garner votes. And when they develop personalities they'll be contenders in years to come. Hoy's dedication, self-sacrifice and discipline as he chased honour for Britain were heroic. So spartan was his training regime that only once he had made himself sick did he feel that he had done himself justice. Some fellow Olympians on Team GB were boasting that they too pushed themselves to the point of sickness, but I suspect they were deploying the old trick of playing Robert Kilroy-Silk DVDs to induce premature nausea. Imposters. Hoy's Beijing treble was also a triumph in which Everyman could share. Not for him the ribbed intensity of a Chris Boardman or even a Sebastian Coe. For as he ascended the podium did he not seem pleasingly normal? Was there not a suggestion contained in his round and sunny face that occasionally he might even have given vent to his inner Jocky and enjoyed the odd refreshment or two?

"If John Milton were alive today I imagine he would be writing this column. A former Blair luvvie, he would have refused the laureateship because of Labour's human rights abuses. Rejected for a job at Ofsted he would have stormed off to teach classics at a prep school while his poems were remaindered as worthy but unreadable by Faber. His three wives would sell their kiss-and-tell memoirs to the Daily Mail. This week's celebration of Milton's fourth centenary has been almost a private affair, led by that home of lost causes, Radio 3. Sixth forms have read the satanic bits of Paradise Lost as if they were upmarket Tolkien. Some have taken a stab at Lycidas. But Milton no longer sets the heart racing. Imagine if this had been the anniversary of the birth of the poet with whom Milton so long shared a pedestal, Shakespeare. There is no doubting the reason. Milton lacks the qualities now considered essential in a poet: concision, humour, or romance. As Dr Johnson said of Paradise Lost: ""No one ever wished it longer."" Readers can handle the poignancy of On His Blindness and snatch pleasure from the great quotes. But the imagery and subject matter of the epics are rooted in a theology and mythology that today are gone. Milton was brought up by his father ""while yet a little child for the study of humane letters"". Not for him the rough and tumble of Shakespeare's Stratford or the London stage. A fun-averse bookworm at Cambridge, at 23 he was already telling the world that his writing was the will of heaven: ""All is, if I have grace to use it so/ As ever in my great Task-Master's eye."" We prefer to like our poets, and Milton was a bore and a prig. Even the youthfulness of the two early poems, L'Allegro and Il Penseroso, has a ponderous religiosity. The play, Comus, is a pastoral-mythical tract about a son of Bacchus and Circe that is near unplayable today. Lycidas, supposedly an ""honest shepherd"", is an elegy on a dead friend, a mix of pagan myths and Puritan Christianity. The least we owe it is, ""Tomorrow to fresh woods and pastures new"", even if most people say fields for woods. Milton was instantly famous. He was lionised in Italy, where he wrote verses in Latin and Italian and was eulogised in return. He met Grotius and Galileo, scholars and philosophers, and returned with an even more exalted sense of his destiny. He wrote a tract on education that would have blown the curriculum authority's collective mind. Schoolchildren were to read a chapter a day from the Greek testament. They should then learn history in Italian, geography in French, the Pentateuch in Hebrew, the Greeks on farming and the Romans on strategy (in the original), followed by a liberal dose of mathematics, medicine, rhetoric and astronomy. Milton's poetic works were couched in inverted Latinate sentences, their imaginative power dependent on the reader's familiarity with the Bible and God, Satan, archangels, devils, damnation and redemption, or the classics and Zeus, Neptune, Prometheus, Ariadne and Clio. Such allusions would have been rich with meaning to those educated in the 17th to 19th centuries. By the second half of the 20th they were largely empty. FR Leavis, an early debunker of Milton, wrote of the need to ""subdue"" his works into sensitivity, though ""in the end our resistance is worn down; we surrender at last to the inescapable monotony of the ritual"". God and Satan seem forever perched on the poet's shoulders. Milton described sex as a ""brutish congress"" with ""two carcasses chained unnaturally together"". With such a man for a husband it is unsurprising that his first wife ran screaming back to her parents within a month. The American critic, Louis Untermeyer, wrote that Milton ""elicits our respect, even our reverence, but he does not command our love ... he is not companionable"". In Paradise Lost, ""there is no relief ... little variety of pitch and practically no change of pace"". Johnson concluded: ""We read Milton for instruction, retire harassed and overburdened and look elsewhere for recreation."" That the modern reader lacks this cultural context may, or may not, be deplorable, but it is a fact. Even Milton's late sonnet on his blindness has his affliction ascribed to God's will, to be assuaged only by a dogged patience: ""Who best/ Bear His mild yoke, they serve Him best ... They also serve who only stand and wait."" Eugene O'Neill was driven to satire, comparing blind Milton with a passenger on the New York subway: ""Methinks I hear the song the harsh wheels sang,/ 'They also pay who only stand and hang'."" That Milton can seem emotionally impenetrable has nothing to do with his language. His English is modern compared with the more popular Chaucer or Shakespeare. Yet both these writers have an accessibility, a capacity to come alive before our eyes. They display earthy English humanism that is absent from Milton, or which has to be mined from deep within his work. This, and their sense of humour, keeps them evergreen. Only Philip Pullman in the explicitly Miltonic His Dark Materials has brought the epics alive. This is why I find it easier to celebrate a different Milton, justly trumpeted earlier this week in these pages by Terry Eagleton. This is Milton the author of Areopagatica, tractarian and revolutionary pamphleteer. His explosive defence of free speech, at a time when such liberty was thought fit only for the stake, might seem commonplace today. But from a writer living in the 17th century's swirl of conflicting intolerances, it was sensational. ""Beware,"" he cried, ""what persecution we raise against the living labours of public men, how we spill that seasoned life of man, preserved and stored up in books."" Who kills a man kills a reasonable creature, ""but he who kills a good book kills reason itself."" Milton's core liberties, of freedom of speech and writing, to a liberal education and to a happy life (which included divorce), were underpinned by his belief that ""opinion in good men is but knowledge in the making"". For God's sake argue, declared this child of Socrates to all who would listen.  As Cromwell's apologist, Milton was certainly a compromiser and a hypocrite, indeed a politician. He defended male chauvinism, colonial repression, torture and execution - to the fury of recent letters to this paper, which regard living in the 17th century as no excuse for not subscribing to the Guardian. Ours is not Milton's day. But his thunderous defence of liberty, an entire cast of mind towering over the English Revolution, speaks to a world where liberalism remains under assault from expediency and populism. He was the articulate champion of Europe's first modern revolution, whose liberties can never be considered secure as long as rulers such as Tony Blair and George Bush plead absolutism or divinity as components of their authority. Milton gazed at the Stuart court, the patricians, the soldiers, the lawyers, the censors, the dumb servants of a repressive autocracy and declared simply, ""Put them to death."" simon.jenkins@theguardian.com • This article was amended on Tuesday 23 December 2008.

"Liberals and lefties may have plenty of unattractive habits, but surely one of the least appealing is the speed with which they're ready to cry betrayal. Part of it is preparation for the future, putting down a marker for the day when - inevitably - the current progressive hero will be seen as a traitor. That way, you get to show how you were never taken in, how prescient you were in your disillusion. ""Tony Blair? I hated him in 1994. Bill Clinton? Denounced him the minute he became governor of Arkansas."" So it is once more with Barack Obama. The gold medal for fast-track disenchantment surely goes to John Pilger, who denounced Obama in January 2008 as ""a glossy Uncle Tom"". Nice, speedy work - and all before Obama had won more than a handful of primaries. To be fair, Pilger was never really enchanted, let alone disenchanted: he skipped the optimism stage and moved straight to pessimism. But plenty of others had high hopes before they recently became anxious. Liberal activists in the US rocked on their heels last month when they saw Obama hand the two top economic posts to Larry Summers and Tim Geithner, disciples of Robert Rubin, the Clinton-era high-priest of deregulation whose shredding of FDR-era rules bears partial blame for the current mess. Then came the blow of the national security team, whose top trio consists of three backers of the Iraq war - one Bush appointee, defence secretary Robert Gates, one pal of John McCain, national security adviser General James Jones, and one self-styled hawk who promised to ""obliterate"" Iran, Hillary Clinton. And it's not just the personnel that has the left worried. Obama has rowed back on some of the promises that once brought the progressives' loudest cheers. A windfall tax on big oil's profits is now on hold. Repeal of the Bush tax cut that favoured America's wealthiest is no longer imminent; instead, Obama seems set to let the tax cut run on till it expires in 2011. And as for the signature, campaign-defining promise to end the war in Iraq, now Obama promises merely to ""design a plan for a responsible drawdown"".  Asked on TV on Sunday whether he might leave a long-term ""residual force"" of up to 50,000 troops in Iraq, he did not deny the figure. On the contrary, he set out what sounded like a substantial military commitment: ""[We] are going to maintain a large enough force in the region to assure that our... civilian personnel and our embassies are protected, to make sure that we can ferret out any remaining terrorist activity in the region..."" Little wonder that one liberal commentator headlined his cry of pain in Sunday's Washington Post: ""This wasn't quite the change we envisioned."" There is nothing Pilger-ish about these complaints. They are genuine reactions to policy shifts that have left some Obama supporters surprised and confused. And yet it would be a mistake to share their early disillusionment - and not only because Obama is still 41 days away from taking the oath of office. As I argued here a fortnight ago, Obama's appointments need not be an automatic cause for concern - not if he is viewing the role of even his most senior staff in essentially technocratic terms.  So far, every indicator suggests he sees himself as the architect of strategy and central decision-maker, with the likes of Gates and Clinton as mere implementers. In this light, Hillary's own ideological bent is barely relevant: she is being hired for her skills in enforcing Obama's will. (This, I concede, is a serious gamble. No president can take every decision and there will be plenty of scope for a Clinton or Geithner to tilt policy in their own direction.) Besides, even the most idealistic liberal should recognise the political pragmatism behind these appointments. Obama has won gushing praise for the team he has assembled, garnering plaudits from those usually hostile to an incoming Democratic administration (Karl Rove among them). The public are pleased too, 79% approving of Obama's handling of the transition, according to a CNN poll yesterday. They like the bipartisan centrism of his team, even if liberals don't. And liberals should be pleased at that - because it strengthens Obama's hand for later. More importantly, there are grounds for optimism in the substance Obama promises. In his weekend radio address, the president-elect set out his priorities for action. The chief headline was a gargantuan programme of public works, on a New Deal scale, designed to save or create millions of jobs and to keep the economy's lifeblood pumping. If progressives believe in anything, it is surely in the power of active government - and that is the creed Obama has now committed himself to, more full-bloodedly than any president since Lyndon Johnson. There were further reasons to be cheerful, contained in the detail. For Obama showed again that he means those taxpayers' dollars to be spent on more than make-work schemes, to leave an enduring legacy, one that is of great value in itself. Top of Obama's list was ""a massive effort to make public buildings more energy-efficient"". That is encouraging for all those who worried that Obama's eco-talk during the campaign was so much greenwash. It may sound like tinkering - Obama literally promised to change the lightbulbs in schools - but it could have a profound effect. Now the makers of energy-efficient bulbs will have a guaranteed market for their products, one that will allow them to scale up production and therefore lower costs. The same goes for the makers of efficient heating systems and suppliers of home insulation: Obama is promising them certainty of demand. This is what the green industry has been waiting for. Some hardcore environmentalists will have been dismayed by his next promise: a huge investment programme in roads and bridges, on a par with the creation of the interstate highway system itself. In Britain, spending on roads tends to bring groans from greens. But the US groups I spoke to yesterday had no such qualms.  The Sierra Club, an environmental organisation in the US, told me that, so long as the money is not spent on new roads, but on maintaining and repairing old ones, they have no objections. The crumbling state of America's highways had been a cause for concern for decades. When a key bridge in Minneapolis collapsed last year, killing 13 people, that concern became alarm. As America is not going to be weaned off cars entirely any time soon, US greens accept that the roads need to be decent and safe - even if they long for the day when fuel-efficient cars drive on them. That brings us to what may prove to be Obama's first major presidential decision: whether or not to bail out the big three car makers, Ford, Chrysler and General Motors. They want billions in government loans. There are traditional reasons to keep them afloat - since as many as 3m jobs may be on the line - but here too Obama has his eye on the bigger picture. Detroit will get the money, he says, but with green strings attached. As the president-elect put it on Sunday: ""If they want to survive, then they'd better start building a fuel-efficient car."" Obama sees the economic crisis as an opportunity to make changes America desperately needs to make anyway. Yes, there are disappointments and there will be more. Yes, progressives need to hold Obama's feet to the fire, to ensure he stays true. But there is no need to howl betrayal just yet.","Jonathan Freedland: By all means hold Obama's feet to the fire, but it's a bit early to cry betrayal",2008-12-10T00:01:00Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"Plenty of people have rightly noted the thinness and brevity of the Queen's speech, the shortest since Labour came to power. Critics say such a slight legislative programme is a sign of a government that's run out of ideas. Defenders say it's a function of recession, that the government is rightly devoting all its energies to steering us through the economic turmoil.  The speech was anyway overshadowed by the row over the Damian Green affair. Which gives me an idea, one that shows there could have been a much more fruitful connection between the raging row over Green's arrest and the government's plans for the future.  For what has the Green episode revealed? As David Starkey argued powerfully on BBC1's This Week, it has exposed the weakness of the House of Commons, an institution whose history is rooted in defiance of state authority, and yet whose supposed custodians, the Speaker and the Serjeant at Arms, when faced with police determined to barge in and snoop around without a warrant, simply bowed and ushered them in. Later we discovered that the Speaker, who is meant to cherish his independence from government and guard it jealously, decided to have a meeting to discuss the raid - with the home secretary and the justice secretary.  This is not because the Speaker, Labour's Michael Martin, is a bad man. It goes wider than him. MPs too almost always put loyalty to party ahead of the independence of the Commons. That is not because MPs are bad people. It is because of the system.  Traditionalists prattle about the sovereignty of parliament, but it's a fiction. We claim a belief in 'separation of powers' but that is bogus: in Britain, the executive and legislature are fused, the former sitting inside and dominating the latter.  The government overshadows parliament utterly, by definition. That is because any government commands a majority in the Commons, otherwise it wouldn't be the government. Once a prime minister is installed, the chamber is reduced to little more than a standing electoral college, which gathers every day to reconfirm him in his post.  I know this is putting it a little starkly. And yes, there are rebellions every now and then that force governments to trim their sails. But as we saw in the Blair years, if a British prime minister is determined to get his way, there is very little that can stop him, certainly fewer obstacles than face an American president or the heads of democratic governments almost anywhere else.  Gordon Brown always seemed to understand this. In the earliest days of his premiership, he made a raft of promises to strengthen parliament, giving it the final say on sending troops to war, promising to make statements to the Commons first rather than the media. But, nearly 18 months later, these feel like small gestures; the basic pattern remains unchanged.  There is a solution. Brown could deliver the wholesale constitutional reform he once hinted at. A convention, much like the one that met in Scotland in the 1990s, could draw up a written constitution setting out how we govern ourselves.  At the heart of it would be, at long last, a democratically elected second chamber. If that body were elected at a different time to the Commons, and had a different political colour from the government of the day, and if there were a ban on members of the second chamber taking ministerial posts, our separation of powers problem would be solved at a stroke. The second chamber, at least, would stand entirely separate from the executive. It would be independent not because its members were better people but because it would be wired that way.  Ah, say the doubters, such ambitious schemes are impossible now: Brown has his hands full dealing with the economic crisis. Just look at the Queen's speech.  To which I say, a recession might be just the time for constitutional reform. It's one of the few areas of political action that does not require any money. It would cost nothing to make our second chamber democratic, rather than the product of party patronage and appointment that it is now. Of course some ministers are tied up sorting out the economic mess. But Jack Straw isn't and nor are plenty of others. With little cash in the kitty, Brown should set Straw to work.  What's more, a crisis is one of the rare moments when people are ready to accept major change. FDR was able to alter fundamentally the way the US was governed during the depression because people could see that the old way wasn't working. Brown has a similar moment of crisis now. He should not let it go to waste.",Jonathan Freedland: Britain's broken constitution,2008-12-07T12:00:00Z,Jonathan Freedland,politics
"If there really is to be a Mamma Mia! sequel, may we expect one or two small parts for feminists? They have surely earned it. After five months in which it has become the most profitable, most sung-along to, most life-enhancing, generally most record-breaking film and DVD event in British history, it would be understandable if the makers of Mamma Mia! considered additional support from some high-profile feminists to be of little moment.  But praise from this unexpected quarter has attracted a fresh audience of the type that never goes to see a critically panned, feel-good musical of surpassing silliness performed, exclusively, by people who can't sing, unless a respected feminist has reported that it made her feel happy for the first time ever. In this case, Julie Bindel, the prominent anti-prostitution campaigner specified that the happiness induced by Mamma Mia! lasted a good 12 hours, during which she felt 'for once that the world was quite a decent place'. Jeanette Winterson records a similar mood-change brought on by this 'celebration of femaleness', Jenni Murray applauds a 'life-affirming piece of work', while novelist Naomi Alderman elaborates: 'It makes you feel relaxed, as a woman watching.'  But not, one gathers, as a man watching. 'The legal definition of torture has been much aired in recent years,' wrote critic Anthony Lane in his review for the New Yorker, 'and I take Mamma Mia! to be a useful contribution to that debate.' Many male critics have agreed with him. 'They just didn't understand it,' Alderman noted in her tribute, confirming that Mamma Mia! is not so much a film, nor, as its distributors describe it, a 'feel-good cinema event', nor even a global phenomenon the like of which has never been seen, as a key signifier of gender.  If reservations about Mamma Mia! have yet to be formally accepted, in medical circles, as a symptom of female sexual dysfunction, there appear to be few doubts among its millions of supporters about the dodginess of any woman who discovers herself to be immune to its life-affirming effects. Or as the poet once put it: 'Hail to thee blithe spirit! Bird thou never wert ...'  So it's possible that some of the eminent writers and thinkers who have declared their affinity with this squawking make-believe have done so because that is easier than betraying that there is something a bit wrong with you or, worse, advertising a haughty lack of empathy with the film's delighted, all-ages, all-kinds-of-women audiences. Not, perhaps, since Diana's death has an event brought together so many different types of women in effusive, sentimental, faintly oppressive sisterhood. Certainly, it's worth being a little cautious before confessing that, though you enjoyed the stage show, you can't quite see what all this fuss is about. Tread softly, because you might be treading on a senior feminist's only experience of happiness.  Of course, a recent succession of woman-pleasing entertainments has regularly whipped up something resembling audience consensus, but even when Vagina Monologues fever was at its preposterous height everyone knew there were plenty of women who would never find anything very life-changing about shouting - as they were dared to do - 'Cunt!' Similarly, despite the claims made this year for the universality of Sex and the City, the movie, and the amazing way its little cast encapsulated half of humanity, it was always obvious that the world must contain at least one person - Angela Merkel, for instance, if not PD James - who would not find it easy to pick a soulmate out of Carrie, the plain one, the idiot and the slut. It followed that, on the whole, women might be more complex than was indicated by those four bag-crazy grotesques. But somehow, the creators of Mamma Mia!, by fusing Abba with Vagina-based self-esteem, Carrie's unlikely conquests and Strictly's thunderous prancing, with a little hint of something very real and regional (Julie Walters), have inspired a degree of female identification that has eluded every rival version of triumphant womanhood, including, one can't help noticing, feminism.  Visit the LSE today and the female student body has yet to be entirely convinced after only 40 years or so of women's liberation that it is abject for a young woman to get her breasts measured so as to qualify for the Miss University London beauty pageant. The participants insist that it's all about personality as well as appearance. Are they not going to be asked, for example, which Sex and the City character they most relate to? Moreover, they say, the event is empowering in that it can't really be demeaning because the subjects have chosen to be demeaned. Same as pole dancing.  With the arguments now so entrenched that some students are demonstrating against the others with placards, it seems high time for a peacemaking trip to Mamma Mia! where these estranged sisters will understand that, when all's said and done, what women really want is to get drunk with other women and live like teenagers for ever. Preferably on a beach. With lots of men on it.  Possibly that is to over-simplify the message of Mamma Mia!, which also emphasises, in a way that the placard-carrying LSE students may well appreciate, that the deep bonds of female friendship are such, fortuitously, as to see them, happily, through their later, men-free, years. Men being, good riddance, a hopeless and emotionally illiterate sex. And yet, as the contestants in Miss University London plainly understand, bouncing on the bed in your dungarees will not pay the bills. Happily, it is a rich man's world and your feisty, independent Streepalike has only to pick her favourite from a patient queue.  Wherever there are desperate producers, they must be wondering if the mesmerising effect of this nonsense can ever be replicated. Would it have been life-affirming enough without lovely Julie Walters? Was it key to its success that this feel-good cinema event resembled, with its unashamed amateur dramatics, nothing more than a directorial debut by Linda Snell, off The Archers? Would anyone have looked twice had not Meryl Streep, after a lifetime's sober endeavour, suddenly volunteered for gamey raunch and that final, dismaying screech of: 'Do you wanna 'nother one?'  Even for those who are otherwise resistant to its charms, the one redeeming feature of Mamma Mia! is its lack of cynicism. Its creators could not have known, for all the international success of the stage shows, that women would respond with limitless, uncritical enthusiasm to a risible, though potentially rather sad, fantasy about middle-aged female omnipotence. So perhaps it is, as its fans maintain, a work of life-affirming genius. Alternatively, being a middle-aged woman in Britain might be much, much worse, than anyone had previously imagined.","Mamma Mia! My, my, how can I resist you?

"It would be nigh on impossible to defend Karen Matthews, convicted last week with Michael Donovan of kidnapping her nine-year-old daughter Shannon. Still, there are things she shouldn't be attacked for. I grew a bit weary hearing about the rundown state of her Dewsbury home, the many boyfriends, her lazy, grasping 'welfare lifestyle' - all that slobbing out and chain-smoking in front of the television and the computer.  It was cruelty that set Matthews apart, not poverty. When her neighbours were contacting social services, they weren't reporting Matthews for being poor or on benefits; they were reporting her because they were anxious about the appalling way she treated her children. Here were people who instinctively understood, in a way that many areas of the media never seem to, that cruelty, unlike poverty, has naff all to do with class.  Interesting, then, how we keep hearing about how this case 'shone a light on underclass Britain', as if all poor people are running amok, drugging, starving and kidnapping their children, tethering them with nooses, hiding them inside divans.  If a light was shone anywhere, it seems to me to have been in an entirely different direction, namely at chattering-class Britain and its confused, self-conscious, essentially guilty reaction to Karen Matthews.  You'd have thought that the McCanns (Matthews's supposed 'inspiration') were as complicated as it was going to get with British love-hate attitudes towards child abduction cases. What a media baked Alaska that was - managing to blow hot and cold at the same time. However, even the McCanns didn't inspire the embarrassed liberal fidgeting, the jittery, ethical self-monitoring that Matthews seemed to.  First, there was the somewhat underpowered reaction to Shannon's disappearance; then the guilt about this lack of interest, leading to a kind of self-flagellating media blitz; this was followed by another bout of strangely muted outrage at the revelation that Karen had after all been responsible; finally, a distinct atmosphere of 'Let's move on'. It was almost as if the Matthews family and, indeed, areas such as Dewsbury are simply too depressing to contemplate for too long, not to mention unsettling. What has polite society's reaction to Karen Matthews been if not a series of Russian dolls, all emerging one after the other, until finally you get to see what you are left with - a big, steaming pile of suppressed, angst-ridden, chattering class guilt.  Isn't this what has truly been illuminated here? Not the Shameless scenes of the underclass, but, rather, the 'shamed' middle class, people who probably disliked Matthews right from the start, mainly because she was badly dressed, inarticulate, had seven children by five different fathers, dragged her hair back in a scrunchie and smoked like the proverbial chimney. Admit it, Karen Matthews was automatically judged as decidedly non-U. How many would have felt like this, but because of Matthews's class, didn't dare admit it, even to themselves? Instead, they suppressed their feelings in a blur of woolly, worthy dithering.  By contrast, working-class reactions have been relatively straightforward: sympathy for a desperate woman, swiftly turning to disgust when the crime was discovered. Certainly, it seems telling that it was one of Matthews's 'chavvy' friends who, sitting in a car with Matthews and a police liaison officer, had the courage to confront her and force her to confess to what she'd done. Would the middle classes, muzzled by their self-consciousness, handcuffed by their instinctive aversion to Matthews, have dared raise the possibility of her guilt in a public forum, as so many did, so many times, in the case of the articulate, attractive middle-class (and therefore OK to attack?) McCanns? Probably not In this way, Karen Matthews has been strangely successful. Not in swindling £50,000 out of the Sun - which to Karen may have constituted the ultimate scratch-card win. Her success was in flushing out a particular form of middle-class moral insularity and its stunted twin, self-loathing. While Karen Matthews was found guilty of a very serious crime, in a funny way, the shame became all of ours. It'll take more than a dead dog to reveal the many truths about drugs Probably you have seen the Pablo the drug mule dog advert? If not, you're in for a treat. It opens with Pablo, a canine drug mule, lying dead with his stomach slit open. Unfortunately, this makes Pablo resemble a sort of horrible pyjama case, but let us move on. After lying dead, Pablo, voiced by David Mitchell, comes to life and trots off on a mission to interrogate dealers, users and other links in the class-A drug chain, in order to discover the 'truth about cocaine'. The advert is well made, well intentioned and wonderfully bizarre. It should appeal to students lazing about in front of Countdown and makes a nice change from the usual drug image of syringes falling into gutters and people with bad skin burgling houses. It appears that Health Minister Dawn Primarolo and Frank, the drugs advisory body, want this £1m campaign to make people stop thinking cocaine is a 'harmless party drug'. Except it always strikes me when people start banging on about the 'truth' of something, the first reasonable question is whose 'truth'? After all, as well as drug barons, dealers, darkness, death, disembowelled dogs and the rest, there are other more prosaic, but no less profound truths. Such as the truth of being given cocaine at a party and talking about yourself for 10 hours straight, until an orderly queue forms to strangle you. Another truth is that good-looking girls never have to pay for it. Then there is the truth someone once told me about his septum being so tattered he was afraid it may one day fall into his soup. And the ultimate truth: it's usually 99 per cent bicarbonate of soda, so why bother wasting your money when you can snort your mum's groceries for free? The first major risk of drug campaigns is that they remind you to buy some. The second is alienating your target audience with dogmatic 'Troofs!' In reality, there can be no truth about a drug such as cocaine until one acknowledges that there are many truths. So much for those smooth operators What is it about world leaders and phones? When Gordon Brown first became PM, he was mocked for making needy, late-night phone calls to ordinary people. Now Barack Obama has been hung-up on twice by congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen.  Ros-Lehtinen says she thought it was a hoax. 'Why would Obama want to call a little slug on the planet like me?' Quite. It's all the more interesting because Obama may soon get a phone call from me he may prefer to hang up on.  Obama is reputed not to cherish the 'special relationship' between the US and Britain, because he has reservations about the worst excesses of our colonial past. And we don't?  How ungrateful anyway. Britain did more than her bit with pro-Obama fever and look at how he treats us once he gets in. A girl could feel dirty and used and not in a good way.  Then again, this could just be something to put in the same bracket as Britney lip-synching on X Factor, plodding about on stage like a disco carthorse, as if to say: 'It's only sucky old Britain - who cares?'  Sometimes we need reminding that however important we think we are, to many Americans - performers, politicians, or otherwise - we are just another European territory, on a par with Belgium or Finland.",Barbara Ellen: Why Karen Matthews really offended the middle classes,2008-12-07T00:01:00Z,Barbara Ellen,society
"The car was the symbol of the prewar 20th century. Henry Ford's Model T, Volkswagen's people's car and even Britain's Morris Oxford were more than just industrial products. Suddenly, industrialisation was able to offer the mass of consumers cheap, convenient and individual mobility. The car changed industrial civilisations and their cultures. Detroit was the undisputed centre of the industry. It manufactured more cars than anywhere else - four out of five across the globe as late as the mid 1950s. Its cars shaped American society. Americans yearned to climb into its Buicks, Cadillacs and Mustangs. The cars denoted your identity and your ambitions. The mobility spawned America's vast, sprawling suburbs. 'What is good for General Motors is good for America,' said its then chairman and chief executive Charlie Wilson. He captured an important truth. Now, America's big three car companies - General Motors, Ford and Chrysler - are fighting for their lives. Last week, they presented last-ditch restructuring plans to Congress, promising a massive increase in fuel-efficient cars and a cessation of corporate excess as the quid pro quo for more than $30bn of soft loans and stand-by credits. Without them, General Motors and Chrysler will be forced into administration; Ford, in a stronger position, could be brought down too.  The US, already reeling from the loss of half-a-million jobs last month, would face the loss of millions more and the collapse of a key part of its manufacturing base. This is more than an appeal for a bail-out: it is American capitalism and society at a crossroads. Many different crises coincide here. There is a crisis of lack of demand created by the credit crunch, with November sales down 40 per cent. There is a crisis of production. Detroit has resisted every regulatory measure aimed at making more energy-efficient cars for decades, but it was particularly successful during the Bush administration. It avoided introducing the fuel-efficient cars the big three manufacture in more tightly regulated Europe, opting for high-margin gas guzzlers for the US domestic market. Now it is paying a fearful price.  The American financial system is too broken to lend and invest in its own hinterland. It found hundreds of billions of dollars for ludicrous bids, deals and mergers during the boom; now, it cannot find $34bn to finance the transformation of a key industry.  Finally, there is a crisis of purpose. Detroit has mocked climate change, assumed cheap petrol is an never-ending and unchallengeable American right and shared the neo-conservative agenda that government is necessarily and always bad. Now, as GM's submission to Congress acknowledges, the lack of an American welfare system means that American companies have to assume crippling obligations that their competitors do not. Moreover, the dysfunctionality of free American finance means that the reviled federal government must become Detroit's banker. Moreover, it was only a few years ago that GM's vice chairman Bob Lutz could pronounce that the theory of climate change was 'a crock of shit', a view that animated Detroit's resistance to developing energy-efficient cars. Detroit's world view, like Wall Street's, has proved cataclysmically wrong. GM's chief executive Rick Wagoner acknowledged last week that he was in Washington because his company 'had made mistakes'. It was an understatement.  Congress and even the Obama team are hesitating to agree the manufacturers' plans because both are unsure whether the proposed restructuring goes far enough. The plans to commit to new flexible-fuel cars, hybrids and, in GM's case, a battery-powered car - the Chevrolet Volt - look good on paper, but Detroit's record of delivery is not good.  There is a realisation that the whole philosophy on which so much American corporate and political decision-making has been based over the last two decades is as bankrupt as the companies. Turn-round depends on wholesale change. The world is near peak oil production. Energy prices will be volatile, but this summer's top figure is a forerunner of what is to come. Cars and, with them, concepts of how mobility is to be created have to change. That, in turn, demands a new role for public leadership. Governments, consumers and companies must agree a new vision and then it must be regulated and legislated for.  It was telling that as Detroit's CEOs were suffering humiliation in Washington, Germany's BMW was unveiling a battery-powered Mini E two years before GM's Volt hits the streets - and with treble the range. If anything, the German love affair with the car trumps America's and its car companies try to resist regulation no less aggressively. But European political systems are less open to being completely bent by corporate lobbying and regulation is seen as more legitimate.  German greens in particular changed the national political discourse in a way German car companies could not beat back; investing in energy efficiency, new engines and new sources of fuel such as hydrogen became a political, legal and commercial imperative. American economists, politicians and Detroit mocked the European model. But regulation in response to voters' concerns has an important effect; the political process is another way consumers can signal what they want. The European Commission chipped in, setting targets for ever-lower carbon emissions, which European car manufacturers accept in principle. There is an important difference between softening a drive to better energy efficiency and life-and-death resistance. Nor should the government's interest be seen as a one-off response to crisis. Leading British sociologist John Urry argues that the system founded on 'automobility' must change. In cities, the future is car pools and car clubs, with the cars being propelled by hydrogen or electricity. Cars will cease to be status symbols; instead, they will become utilitarian instruments of a collective mobility. Britain has a stake in this; Vauxhall, owned by GM, is looking for support from the British government to save 5,000 jobs here. But both the US and UK governments must go well beyond short-term bail-outs.  We need to think of nothing less than a sustained technological, industrial and cultural effort to change our approach to mobility and what we manufacture. It has implications for everything - from the priorities of our banks to how we plan our cities. Success will require states and companies accepting a more interdependent relationship than they had during the conservative ascendancy. Detroit is at a crossroads. Car companies need to rethink their mission from scratch, for their own sake and the world's. The car was a symbol of the 20th century.",Will Hutton: Detroit has run out of road. The car's future lies in Europe,2008-12-07T00:01:00Z,Will Hutton,world
"Those of us with a weakness for such amusements have a tendency to detect pantos everywhere at this time of year. There's the high-camp outrage down at Lapland New Forest, for instance, where a King Rat's scheme to chisel gold sovereigns out of the great British public has been foiled, with the audience delighted by a few elf v elf punch-ups along the way.  But for sheer seasonal absurdity there has been nothing to match the Damian Green saga - a very British fiasco in three chaotic acts. Everyone involved takes themselves terribly seriously, as the best panto troupers do, but there's no earthly reason any of the rest of us should, no matter how desperately they would have you believe that the most sacred traditions of political power are being threatened. Any fool can see they are merely being upheld.  There have been blunders and fibs, truncheons and ceremonial maces, and acts both cowardly and dastardly. Two of the principals have been got up in ruffles, stockings and buckled shoes. On Wednesday the Queen entered stage right in a pumpkin-style coach to admiring ""oohs"" and ""aahs"", only to be succeeded by Speaker Martin giving us his Baron Hardup. Hang on, MPs might counter, the defence of parliamentary privilege is a serious matter. And so is the stepdaughter abuse of Cinderella, my darlings, but context is all - and the sight of a bloke in stockings and frilly cuffs begging for the audience's sympathy was a timely reminder that your place of work basically resembles a music hall, where one side of the audience is traditionally encouraged to shout down the other. You may be on the point of spotting the irony in the very place that has systematically voted to strip the public of so many ancient rights and liberties suddenly becoming so keen to get the same people exercised about its own rights and liberties. Yet our politicians remain serially unaware of what difficult people they are to root for. I suspect the average high street does not throng with members of the public who are outraged on Mr Green's - or indeed democracy's - behalf. Instinct suggests that a significant number would in fact exhibit signs of schadenfreude that the very Westminster villagers who are perceived as waving through all sorts of petty infringements on people's day-to-day existence are occasionally subject to a little Plod-based hassle themselves. Now this may be unfair, or uninformed, or the sort of behaviour that causes some to wail that we are sleepwalking into a police state. But you can hardly blame the audience. Consider the farcical show presented to them this week. In one scene they saw Speaker Martin confirm that there would be an inquiry into whether Speaker Martin had been involved in any wrongdoing - an inquiry conducted by men handpicked by Speaker Martin. In another, they saw Boris Johnson declare he had spoken to his friend Damian Green and was convinced of his innocence, apparently prejudging a criminal investigation within a police authority of which he is the self-appointed chairman.  How can anyone in their right mind say the noble traditions of British politics are not being upheld to the very letter? This is how most people already think the country is run, and those on both sides of this current drama have merely confirmed it for them. The malfunctioning entity that those in its employ pompously insist upon subdividing into the executive, the legislature and the judiciary appears to outsiders - we huddled masses - as a vast self-supporting structure of cronies and cock-up merchants, whose chronic inability to follow procedures they themselves have forced into legislation is so utterly consistent that it renders the whole system a living satire of itself. Yet again, one feels obliged to point out that these people are Not Like Us. The millions of Britons who devour cop shows have probably seen hundreds of people narrow their eyes and hiss ""Where's your warrant?"" over the years, and would hear the same phrase fly from their lips as a Pavlovian reaction were PC Plod to demand a search of their homes - all of which makes the failure of Commons officials to do so anathema to anyone normal. Either these people don't watch cop shows, in which case they confirm themselves to be the unknowable weirdos we already believe them to be; or they watch them but are too stupid to understand them, in which case they deserve everything they don't get. In the event that Damian Green is now charged with this offence of ""misconduct amounting to an abuse of the public's trust"", a decent defence lawyer should be able to demolish the matter in 30 seconds flat, simply by pointing out that the public trust politicians about as much as they do journalists and estate agents, and that there is therefore no case to answer. You cannot abuse trust that was never there in the first place.  So whenever the curtain comes down on this affair, let us all see it as the low opera it is, a performance to remind MPs of their own importance, and the rest of us of their complete preposterousness. Nothing whatsoever will change, and we shall be booing and hissing them in precisely the same manner next year. End of parliament as we know it? Altogether now: ""Oh no it isn't."" marina.hyde@theguardian.com",Marina Hyde: For sheer seasonal absurdity there has been nothing to match the Damian Green saga,2008-12-06T00:01:00Z,Marina Hyde,politics
"America seems much in need of Roosevelt's maxim to stop fearing fear itself. Virtually all comment on the Mumbai massacre has mentioned 9/11 and al-Qaida, and thus invited citizens to continue feeling afraid. No matter that Mumbai appears to have been primarily about Kashmir and the status of India's Muslims. No matter that Osama bin Laden has no dog in that fight. Any stick will do to elevate al-Qaida as America's enemy number one. Last week, the CIA warned of a terrorist threat that ""might be unleashed"" during the presidential transition, a threat that George Bush described as ""dangerously real"". On Wednesday Barack Obama was formally told by a congressional inquiry that ""it is more likely than not that a weapon of mass destruction, either nuclear or biological, will be used in a terrorist attack"" in his first year of office. The inquiry demanded that an official must be appointed ""to oversee efforts to prevent such an attack"", as if millions of Americans in and out of uniform were not doing that already.  Then London added its pennyworth, with a Home Office minister, Lord West, telling of ""another great plot building up again"" and a ""huge threat"" from al-Qaida. The purpose of all this scaremongering remains a mystery. Reactions to Mumbai have seemed to suggest Americans are still seeking fellowship in their 9/11 pain, as after the London and Madrid bombings. Gone are the days when Americans would tell Britons to shrug off IRA terrorist attacks (many instigated from America) and grow up. Any explosion anywhere now abets the extraordinary 9/11 iconography, underpinning the politics of fear that has been the leitmotif of the Bush presidency. Debating this presidency in New York on Tuesday night, I found myself pitted against Bush's impresario of fear, Karl Rove. Nothing in his master's glorious reign quite matched his ""victory"" over terror. The sense of unreality was equalled by Rove's supporters, to whom all who did not fear the ""Islamofascists"" were ""liberal upper-east side elitists"", an apparently crushing epithet. One assured me that Afghanistan would soon be won by merely ""moving the surge"" to Kabul. The whole evening was like the scene in Gone with the Wind where Southern gallants out-boast each other in predicting victory over the Yankees.  Rove was undeniably a master manipulator of fear politics, like Tony Blair's Alastair Campbell, who called him a ""kindred spirit"". Both Bush and Blair were led to portray al-Qaida in its Tora Bora cave as they had Saddam Hussein, as a threat to their respective realms. It was what the sociologist Ulrich Beck described as an exaggerated risk ""exploited as an elixir to an ailing leader"". On this the two leaders built a culture of self-validating counter-terrorism, where both the absence of any threat and the presence of one can be made equally supportive.  The media's fondness for describing any explosion as ""al-Qaeda-linked"" has turned what was a tiny, if efficient, cabal of fanatics into a global menace, ridiculously on a par with Hitler and postwar communism. Whoever said the political brain has advanced over time was mad. On every visit to America I am stunned by the pervasiveness of fear. Terrified officials pounce on the slightest deviation from security rules. Americans must strip almost to their underwear to board even the shortest domestic flights. IDs are scanned in the meanest office blocks. Computers must be dismantled. National guardsmen troop out at dawn to protect New York installations ""against the terrorist threat"".  The repressive Patriot Act - mocking a patriotism that was once built on courage and the rule of law - remains in operation. Getting through American immigration with a brown face is an indignity that many Indians and Arabs of my acquaintance now simply refuse to endure. I had trouble even with a Baghdad visa in my passport. Barack Obama, who is pledged to close Guantánamo Bay, is being challenged to say what he will do with what the conservative Weekly Standard asserts are ""250 participants in the most devastating terrorist attacks in history"" from ""an enemy unlike any other this nation has ever faced"". Britons should not smile at this hyperbole. The same madness afflicts Jacqui Smith's Home Office. In the 1960s Richard Hofstadter, the American political scientist, puzzled over the anti-intellectualism of much of American public life, echoing the remark of the Puritan, John Cotton, in 1642 that ""the more learned and witty you bee, the more fit to act for Satan"". Listening to the debate on Tuesday I realised how deep is that strand, how strong the line of descent to the war on terror from previous generations who likewise puffed up the mafia and home-grown communism.  The 1950s Kefauver commission on organised crime sought a foe to demonise as foreign, sinister and ubiquitous. The inquiry found that there was no national ""mafia"" worthy of the name, or of their attention, just disparate bunches of local hoodlums. Kefauver and the FBI, whose burgeoning empire depended on him, were furious. They had come to need the mafia and its menace to justify their budget, effort and status.  The same synthetic sense of fear enveloped the McCarthy hearings on communism. A grain of truth was exaggerated to boost McCarthy's standing as a defender of the people against a real and present danger, that of reds under every bed. Communism had to be erected as an internal weapon of mass destruction, and much cruelty resulted. At least organised crime and communism posed genuine threats to American liberties. Al-Qaida does not, yet it has become the ruling obsession of Bush's courtiers. They see al-Qaida fiends on every side, bearded mullahs, caches of bombs, ricin and anthrax. The precautionary principle has become fanaticised. By treating the unknown as an enemy, we ensure that the unknown becomes one.  Most of the outrages committed by graduates of the Pakistan terrorism camps are locally motivated, and will continue as long as such motivation survives. A network of criminal suicide squads with no coherent programme has no conceivable hope of undermining western democracy. It can just set off bombs, and will always do so if front-line policing is weak and constantly overruled by a grand ""counterterrorism"" bureaucracy.  Just when America had won a real victory in the century-old combat with communism, it allowed itself to be terrified by a band of fanatics who, in part through America's negligence, ""got lucky once"" and pulled off a coup on 9/11. For seven years its behaviour at home and image abroad have been dogged by the reaction to it. The challenge to Obama, here as elsewhere, is immense.  The attractive feature of the America in which I once lived was its bold self-confidence. To find the survivors of the Bush presidency still cowering in a mental bunker afraid of a bunch of Arabs - and with British ministers for company - strips western democracy of a leadership that should be both heroic and sensible. It is surely an un-American activity. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com","Simon Jenkins: America, cowering to an imaginary enemy, is not the country I once knew",2008-12-05T00:01:00Z,Simon Jenkins,world
"The massacre in Mumbai has stirred the ghost of war between India and Pakistan, just when relations were supposedly improving. That is what the terrorists wanted. That is the lesson that came from the west after 9/11. If belligerence and thumping retaliation are the lodestars of counter-terrorism, India is now entitled to assault Pakistan.  Until Washington went to war on Afghanistan in the autumn of 2001, virtually every nation in the region sympathised with the US over 9/11. The widespread view was that Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida had gone too far, much too far. It might take time to curb him, but even Iran and Egypt sent condolences, and Yasser Arafat gave blood for the people of New York. We tend to forget this. The wars on Afghanistan and Iraq crushed all opportunity to use the disaster as a prelude to reconciliation, though Tony Blair did boldly pursue that opening in the weeks immediately after 9/11. It was obliterated by the Pentagon's rush to war. The spirit of jihad fuelled a retaliatory jihad. The west breathed the word crusade. A similar opportunity can be detected again. Sensible Indians know that sensible Pakistanis are appalled by the horror taking hold of their country. Opinion in both states can see that the surest route to curbing extremism is to normalise relations and collaborate against an insurgency that is feasting on the Nato occupation of Afghanistan. More Pakistani soldiers have died as a result of the occupation than those of any other state. Exhausted is the best word to describe the so-called arc of instability from the Mediterranean to Islamabad after eight years of western intervention. Last week I watched Lebanon celebrate its independence day in the streets of Beirut. Soldiers marched, bands played, politicians saluted under awnings while planes roared overhead. But the streets were totally empty, cleared of people for fear of terrorist attack. There was not a murmur of applause. Even in modern Beirut, bleak, fearful exhaustion ruled the day. Lebanon is exhausted by its feud with Syria and Syria by its feud with Israel. Hamas in Gaza is exhausted by its feud with Fatah. Israel, even as it approaches an election, is exhausted by the threat from Hizbullah. As a result its politicians might, just might, at last cut a deal with Syria - through the agency of the Saudis - on Golan and the West Bank.  Eastwards, the war in Iraq is petering out through sheer exhaustion. Two million Iraqis camped outside Damascus cannot hope to go home until the Americans have left and some new settlement reached between Sunnis and Shias.  Iran, too, is a nation exhausted by external sanctions and internal squabbling between clerics and secularists, its economy deteriorating and oil revenues crashing. If only the outside world can back off, a moderate victory in its forthcoming election is just possible.  In Afghanistan exhaustion is reflected in the desperate pragmatism of its ruler, Hamid Karzai. He surveys his dwindling sphere of power but cannot cleanse his regime of the corruption and drug-lordism that exasperates his western masters. Seven years after the toppling of the Taliban, the leaders of the west now advocate talking to them.  Along the North-West Frontier, Nato is entering precisely the strategic trap that closed round the Russians in the 1990s - and the British in the 19th century. Yet even here, the rough coalition of Taliban, al-Qaida and other insurgents is hard pressed by the Pakistan army, while extremist subsidies flowing from the Gulf are said to be declining. It is possible, just possible, that even al-Qaida too is exhausted. Long wave theory suggests that the Muslim world may now be ready for a reaction against the extremism that has brought such devastation on its head for the past two decades. It has not just torn apart small countries, such as Lebanon, Iraq and Afghanistan, but convulsed large ones, such as Turkey, Egypt, Iran and Pakistan. It has given unprecedented potency to sects, militias and gangs, yet has failed to create peace - let alone the caliphate.  Any traveller to these parts at present is overwhelmed by Obamania. From the dinner tables of Lahore to the lecture halls of Beirut's American University, the president-elect carries an astonishing burden of expectation. To a people for whom George W Bush became synonymous with mindless anti-Americanism, Obama's race, name, moderation and lack of bombast have risen like a messiah from another land.  The hopes are unreal. Obama will back the Saudi plan for the Middle East and push Israel to the negotiating table. He will end the occupation of Iraq. He will calm relations with Iran and recognise that US aggression has aided only extremism. He will unleash his general, David Petraeus, to negotiate with the Taliban. He will stop bombing Pakistan villages and recruiting thousands to al-Qaida. Obama will aid Pakistan's secular schools, not its army. These expectations are close to absurd. The new president, in his appointments and public statements, promises to be no more coherent in his regional strategy than other Democrats. Anyone who thinks a ""surge"" can win the war in Afghanistan, or is ready to invade Pakistan to guard its nuclear weapons has, at best, a steep learning curve ahead. Yet Obama's store of goodwill must be unprecedented for a US leader in modern times. Were he to visit Cairo or Beirut or even Tehran, he would be greeted as a custodian of promise. An area battered by dreadful US policies for a decade wants only a smile, a nudge and a promise to do better from a country that has done it such harm. It is not the plausibility of these expectations that is significant but the fervour with which they are held. The Lebanon Daily Star wrote for the region last week when it declared: ""We all went to the polls on November 4."" If Obama can withdraw his troops from the region, stifling the chief oxygen of jihad, a moment of opportunity would be at hand.  When I last visited Beirut 25 years ago an American battleship, the USS New Jersey, was lobbing shells into Lebanon's Chouf Mountains, overlooking the city. It was smashing the hillside villages for no other reason than to give US marines cover for what was a humiliating retreat from Beirut.  It took Lebanon more than a decade to rebuild from that intervention. Perhaps when Obama withdraws from Baghdad and Kabul, their recovery will be quicker. That is today's opportunity. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com",Simon Jenkins: At last this exhausted region is energised - by its old foe,2008-12-03T00:01:00Z,Simon Jenkins,world
"When she was a college student in the late 70s, Alison Bechdel wrote to her parents informing them that she was a lesbian. Her mother wrote back saying she doubted that this was the case, but if so, then it was highly inconvenient. Her father also wrote, telling her in vague terms that it was an issue he should, perhaps, have taken a stand on years ago. She had no idea what he was talking about until her mother rang. ""Your father,"" she said, ""has had affairs with other men."" One of them was Roy.  ""Roy,"" said Bechdel, ""our babysitter?""  Two years ago, Bechdel published a book that she hoped would act on her family like a miracle cure. ""I had this fantasy that this book was going to heal us and bring us all together. I was going to tell the truth and everything would be out in the open."" The truth of her father's not-quite repressed homosexuality, and the day he stepped in front of a truck and was killed, in what she believes was suicide, required a lot of healing. And? She smiles in understatement.  ""That didn't happen.""  Before Fun Home, her first extended work, came out, Bechdel was a respected but relatively obscure, cartoonist with a syndicated strip, Dykes To Watch Out For, in various alternative newspapers in America. The title of her graphic memoir is the nickname she and her two brothers used for the Bechdel Funeral Home, the family business her father ran in rural Pennsylvania, and where they used to help out as children. Her brother drove the hearse and she once passed a pair of scissors to her father over an open corpse, mid-embalmment.  These days, she lives in Vermont. In the two years since Fun Home was named book of the year by Time magazine, her life has become a lot busier. We meet in New York, where Bechdel is promoting The Essential Dykes To Watch Out For, a compendium of her comic strips published between 1987 and 2008. The night before, more than 100 people came to hear her speak at an uptown bookshop. The attention of a wider and more mainstream audience has, in some ways, inhibited Bechdel. ""I got a little less daring with the sexual material 'cos I knew a broader range of people were reading it,"" she says. ""I kind of wish I was able to hew to my path, no matter what."" She says this with a wryness that takes into account the fact that, if asked to describe her, ""inhibited"" might not be her family's first choice of word. What she did in Fun Home still amazes her in some ways. ""It's a strange, exhibitionistic streak in a person who ... I consider myself pretty shy and retiring. I don't know why I'm compelled to reveal these things in public."" Compared to the pre-Stonewall repression of her father's youth, Bechdel's own coming of age in Reagan-era America was relatively painless, but her family's reaction was not. In the early comic strips, the heroine, Mo, toils at MadWimmin Books and is part of an activist community similar to the one Bechdel escaped to during her 20s, which she manages to simultaneously celebrate and gently mock. The strip is a soap opera: her characters fall in and out of love, have children, get gender realignment, change their minds about it and occasionally try to get regular jobs, arranging their not-for-profit work histories into what one character calls the Résumés of the Damned (""You must have done some work which had little or no socially redeeming value?""). Bechdel summarises her own career thus: ""If I hadn't been a lesbian, I would've gone into advertising."" She started writing the strip after being rejected from art school because ""I had nothing else to do"". She is wary of claiming her father too completely as an unfulfilled figure, aware that it serves her own purposes too neatly. Her strength as an artist is in catching herself in these deceptions and, more broadly, the deceptions in the movements she belongs to. ""When I was young, there was this very cohesive little gay world, an alternative world to the mainstream,"" she says. ""That's not the case any more. Things have gotten so assimilated. I feel in some ways I was longing for those days, in a way that I eventually had to let go of. The whole purpose of a liberation movement is to render itself obsolete. You can't go on clinging to it."" The attractiveness of the world depicted in The Essential Dykes, contrasted with the one she grew up in, can hardly be overstated. Bechdel's childhood home had an ""arctic climate"" that went beyond primness into something else. Looking back, everything seemed loaded. Her father loved flowers and ornate decor, restoring their 19th-century home to its original splendour. He was subject to great sulks and rages. He had an ""obelisk collection"", including a knee-high jade column that propped open his library door and, as he points out to his daughter in a scene depicted in Fun Home, ""symbolised life"".  Bechdel's first thought after that phone conversation with her mother was that she had been upstaged; her moment had been absorbed into some larger family drama. When she next went home, she and her father had an awkward conversation that never really got off the ground and then, as had often been the case, they communicated via books. Fun Home is a memoir about, among other things, reading. He gave her Colette; she left him a copy of Kate Millett's Flying. Just before he died crossing the road outside their house, run down by a Sunbeam Bread truck, he had been reading Albert Camus' A Happy Death. It makes no sense to Bechdel to imagine what her father would have made of her memoir, because ""if he hadn't died, it would never have been written"". Her mother, on the other hand, has been mortified, mostly by the sense of being whispered about behind her back. ""Reviewers discussing my family, discussing my parents by name - I think that was very unnerving for my mother. And hard for my brothers.""  It didn't matter that she kept her mother's appearance in the book to a minimum. ""It's really a violation to write about other people, even if you're completely positive about them,"" she says. ""I feel that I treated my mother very positively in Fun Home, but that didn't change the way that it hurt."" Early on in the writing, Bechdel showed her mother some drafts and she was so horrified that she clammed up and wouldn't talk any more about it. But then her mother gave her a box of love letters that Bechdel's father had sent her when posted abroad in the army, before they were married. He had written to her mother in touching terms, casting himself as Scott Fitzgerald and her as Zelda. Still, the problem of perspective remains. ""Fun Home was my story. Hers was very different. Not that she disputed the facts, but she feels like I missed the point or something. I did. I missed the point of her story. I don't know her story."" While Bechdel speculated on the relationship between her own coming out and her father's probable suicide, her mother's reading of what happened must surely have dwelt on the fact that she had asked him for a divorce, two weeks before his death.  Despite all this, Bechdel felt great relief when Fun Home came out. ""It was like the hard drive of my brain had slowed to a crawl because of all of this material in there. And when I got the book out it was like clearing my hard drive and now my brain is all flowing smoothly and able to devote itself to new tasks."" There was talk of a film option. ""But for a terrible movie to be made of this intimate story of my life was just an unbearable prospect,"" she says.  Now she wants to do other things. There is the new collection, The Essential Dykes To Watch Out For, and she has written a graphic essay about Vermont for the anthology State by State as well as one for Granta, a ""meta-essay"" about writing Fun Home. She wants her next book to be a memoir of her own relationship history, ""but using it as a laboratory to look at bigger and more abstract issues about the self and other. I don't know if I can pull it off."" In 2004, she was briefly married, before California reversed its ruling on same sex marriages. ""And then we split up anyway. So. Oh, well.""  In Fun Home, Bechdel chooses a passage from Camus as a fitting epitaph to her parent's marriage. ""He discovered the cruel paradox by which we always deceive ourselves twice about the people we love - first to their advantage, then to their disadvantage."" For the next memoir, she is going back to her ex-girlfriends, asking for permission to write about them. ""I'm hoping to have everyone be OK with it."" She smiles beneath the weight of experience. ""That might be a little unworkable"". • The Essential Dykes To Watch Out For by Alison Bechdel is published by Jonathan Cape (£16.99) on December 18.",Emma Brockes: Alison Bechdel talks about her new book Fun Home,2008-12-01T00:01:00Z,Emma Brockes,review
"This recession is terrifying because it's assuming the character of an economic black hole. Property prices and economic activity slide, so that soon the problem becomes not the banks refusing to lend but the borrowers' worries. That creates a further downward spiral. The banks become even more cautious. Unless this cycle is broken, the economy is sucked away. Standard economics and standard policy responses are useless because gloom creates its own rationality. A herd effect created the bubble. Now a herd effect is creating the opposite. A solution requires finding economics and policies that break the bearish psychology. Step forward Robert Shiller, a softly spoken and mildly eccentric Yale professor, who specialises in studying the psychology of booms and busts. Financial markets, left to themselves he says, reliably mismanage risk. They get carried away in booms. And in busts there's a collective hysteria in which all we see is risk, uncertainty and loss. Letting 'financial markets work', as happened in Britain and America from the 1980s to today, has been disastrous. Instead, we need to devise interventions that help the markets manage risk better, which they will not do of their own accord. This, he thinks, is practical Keynesianism. I agree. He was in London last week, promoting his new book The Subprime Solution and between events he met the Chancellor, the Governor of the Bank of England, the Secretary of State for Business and Regulatory Reform and even - for a few minutes - the Prime Minister. One reason for taking him seriously is that he's the only prominent economist who can claim to have predicted today's bust. But his solutions are so non-standard and outside conventional thinking, and his manner so self-deprecating and academic, that it takes a while to get the radicalism of his message. Minds seemed to wander last week - and it took me a good few meetings before I understood. If we are going to get banks to lend and borrowers to borrow, argues Shiller, we have got to reduce decisively the risks they confront. He starts with the mortgage market and the collapse in house prices because they are at the centre of this crisis.  Mortgages, he thinks, always unfairly contained too much risk for ordinary borrowers. Now they are a disaster. Who in their right mind would pledge hard-earned savings as a deposit for a house in a falling property market and, on top, take responsibility for repaying a big mortgage over 25 years when they may lose their job? It is far too much risk and reflects an unfair balance of power between borrower and lender. A left-of-centre government should insist that mortgages are redesigned so they contain far less risk for ordinary borrowers. His radical 'Shiller' mortgage has two components. The first is that repayments automatically adjust to the economic circumstances of the borrower over the life of the mortgage. Repayments rise in line with your growing income, but fall or stop if you lose your job. At a stroke there are no more repossessions or fear of repossessions. In any case, banks hate repossessions because of the terrible PR and the irrationality of crystallising a loss on their mortgage books. For the borrower, a mortgage becomes less daunting. The second component is that the borrower should be able to insure their down payment - and their housing equity - against loss. Shiller does not stop there. He thinks that the government should launch 'livelihood insurance', so that people can insure themselves against the risk of their wages being reduced. And he advocates a massive boost to the Citizens Advice Bureau network so there is an infrastructure of trusted advisers who can help citizens understand the case for better mortgages and insurance and take up the new financial packages. These measures will help make the world safer for borrowers. The next step is to do the same for lenders. I persuaded Robert Shiller to read the Crosby report on the British mortgage market released last week by the Treasury, along with the pre-Budget report. In my view, it is one of the most alarming reports published by the Treasury in my working life. James Crosby, deputy chair of the Financial Services Authority and former chief executive of HBOS, believes that without intervention in 2009, new net mortgage lending in Britain is very likely to fall below zero, spelling calamity for house prices and the wider economy. Like Shiller, he thinks that essentially there is too much risk for the market. Every available penny of new savings has already been earmarked, leaving none left over for new mortgages. Lenders are shellshocked. Even if the banks were nationalised, they would face the same problem. Crosby has a Shiller-style solution. The government must reduce the risks that are terrifying the mortgage markets. It should offer a £100bn guarantee so creating a £100bn flow of new credit to home buyers. The Chancellor has promised to do something, but perhaps not this. Shiller, unsurprisingly, wholeheartedly backs Crosby. The two ideas together - Shiller mortgages and Crosby insurance - would break the gloom, take the risk out of the markets and bottom out the recession. These principles could be extended to other areas of lending. The trouble is that it is not just ordinary borrowers who don't understand finance. Neither do many bankers, committed to keeping their power and offering the same old mortgages where the borrower assumes all the risk. Nor do officials, who understand the pros and cons of measures like last week's cut in VAT, but are outside their comfort zone when it comes to banks. It can't go on; the risk of a deep recession is too great. We need the state to take the risks out of finance.",Heed the visionaries who can ease the pain of recession,2008-11-30T00:01:00Z,Will Hutton,politics
"Of late Gordon Brown reminds one of a chap whose wife has informed him that there is a massive hole in the family budget. She will watch with a raised eyebrow as he finds a temporary VAT cut down the back of the sofa, and presents it to her with an imploring look. She will sigh in exasperated sympathy as he remembers £700m worth of supertax in an old post office account. And then she will point gently at the utterly undiminished hole in the balance sheet, and say: ""I don't mean to state the bleeding obvious, love, but there is a sports car sitting in the garage, and I can't help feeling this might be the moment to let it go"". His beloved Trident! Not a scratch on it, of course, and so adoringly maintained. Oh, he knows it's irrational, and an indulgence, and a throwback to when his life was completely different. And it's been murder to get the parts down the years. It's stupidly self-regarding to be worrying what the neighbours would say, and it would solve so many of their problems in a single swoop. But must it really go? It must, and in my ideal world Gordon Brown would get straight on the telly and announce an urgent review of the whole business. Talk about a magic bullet. Britain's retention of a nuclear deterrent would be ridiculous if we were all lighting our cigars with tenners. As we enter an immeasurable recession it is full-blown insanity. Earnest ideas these tax rises and VAT cuts may be, but the glaring truth is that the economic crisis will have to mean huge cuts in public spending. A bare minimum of £37bn between 2011 and 2014, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies - so you may be on the point of spotting the luxury item in the trolley. Even in the years when the fat cows were emerging from the Nile - 2007, for instance, when MPs narrowly voted to renew Trident at an estimated cost of £70bn - the arguments against were so luminous as to barely need repetition. Suffice to say we have been basking for some years now in the blissful peace secured by our arms race victory. However, from New York to London, Basra and Mumbai, there do seem to be those who remain unimpressed by our submarine collection, or India's nuclear programme, and at any rate appear able to hold their own using boxcutters or standard machine-guns. ""It is impossible to predict the future,"" was Tony Blair's typically forensic explanation as to why we still needed Trident. ""The one thing that is certain is the unpredictability of it."" Yes, we are all set for the type of war we have never had; yet for those wars we can predict with depressing accuracy (considering we've started most of them) and involve AK-47s or simple explosive devices, we remain criminally unprepared - as so many coroners lambasting the MoD for basic equipment shortages have pointed out. Up to 75% of Britons were opposed to Trident renewal or in favour of a delay, according to a Channel 4 News/Populus poll before last year's Commons vote, but a 2005 poll for Greenpeace was arguably more revealing. When asked ""Do you think the government should replace its nuclear weapons or not?"" , 46% of respondents said it shouldn't, 44% said it should, and 10% didn't know. However, when told that the cost of replacement was the equivalent of building 1,000 schools, 54% opposed replacement, and only one in three supported it. Clearly, a significant proportion of people had no clue how much these things cost. But then, we don't talk about such fluff these days, which seems odd to those of us who grew up as relatively recently as the 80s, when people talked about nuclear weapons an awful lot. Today we scarcely discuss them rationally or irrationally, and if you are sitting there thinking that this is partly a failure of the media, then you are right. To judge us on what is deemed to sell our newspapers and drive our web traffic, we are far more preoccupied with other comparatively infinitessimal aspects of public spending. Is it not a national embarrassment that we should be able to field so many people willing to make irate telephone calls about Mr Russell Brand - who cost the British public somewhere in the very low six figures before he decommissioned himself - while sitting mutely as tens of billions that could be spent providing better hospitals for our families are lavished on something so logically flawed as to be utterly pointless? In these drastically straitened times, we need to stop being a nation of people who could tell you in pounds and pence the curtain allowance given to MPs, but can barely get in the ballpark on how much we spend on nuclear missiles. Those who used to chuck all sorts of luxuries into their supermarket trolleys without really paying attention to the price are suddenly all over their weekly budgets; and these same people should start thinking about major public spending the same way. It's time to start talking about nuclear weapons again - and I for one shall be boosting the economy by getting a Scrap Trident badge made up without delay.marina.hyde@theguardian.com",Marina Hyde: It's time to start talking about nuclear weapons again,2008-11-29T00:01:00Z,Marina Hyde,politics
"One of the most welcome sights to a traveller in India is the door of a five-star hotel. It promises such a large change in your personal circumstances. Step inside, and everything that seems to make India so difficult or different is suddenly left behind. No more heat, no more clamorous traffic, none of the thousand small irritations and opacities that can make daily life in India a challenge to natives and foreigners. A porter in a smart turban is already reaching for your luggage. Soon a lovely girl with a name-badge pinned to her sari (""Ritu"", ""Malini"") is smiling across the check-in desk as though her prince had come.  The room will be big and cool and the shower strong. A basket of fruit waits on the table: a banana, two oranges and a mango nestling under brown cellophane, next to a folded linen napkin and a finger bowl with a flower petal floating at its surface. Urban India, the world you've just left, now exists as a benevolent picture behind the window glass, silent apart from a muffled honking from the streets below and, for all you can tell, no hotter than the air-conditioned atmosphere inside. You go down to the restaurant and decide it will be perfectly safe to eat a salad.  When I first went to India in the 1970s five-star hotels were much rarer than now and confined to two indigenous chains, both of which had grown behind the shelter of a protectionist economy that discouraged international franchises such as Hiltons and Holiday Inns. There were the Taj hotels, owned by the Tatas and named after their first hotel, opened in 1903 in the city then known as Bombay; and the Oberoi group, which took the family name of its founder.  The stories of both families were interwoven with imperial India's. Jamsetji Tata, a Bombay Parsi, made a fortune by provisioning a British military expedition to Abyssinia and went on to own steelworks and shipping lines (his descendants also own Jaguar and Land Rover). MS Oberoi, a Punjabi, started out as a bell-hop in a hotel in Simla when that hill station was still the summer capital of British India.  Both hotel groups were well managed. This was the striking thing. In a country of turgid enterprise, both public and private, five-star hotels stood out as models of business efficiency and achievement. They were modern India in embryo, though not just because of their confidence and success. There was also the question of price. You would go to your room and think of the sights you had seen that day - the barefoot sweeper on the station platform or the peasant planting rice - and start to compute how many months or even years that person would have to work, impossibly saving 100% of his wages, to afford one night in your Taj or your Oberoi.  It was a pointless calculation, no more than the luxurious moralising of a visitor, because you loved your room and you weren't going to trade places with the sweeper: that was the way the world was. Nonetheless, the results were startling and still are. An average room at the Taj in Bombay costs £300 a night, say 24,000 rupees. An agricultural labourer in Bihar, certainly one of the poorest parts of India, might earn 1,500 rupees a month, a security guard in Delhi 2,500 a month. Mumbai's wages are three times the Indian average, but a Mumbai policeman will be lucky to be on more than 5,000 rupees a month. A year's salary with overtime would buy him three nights at the Taj. Britain can hardly boast about equality, but a London constable's salary would cover at least 50 nights at Claridges.  Sometimes, remembering the world outside, I would sit in my room and wonder why nobody wanted to kill me. Islamist terrorism was not then the problem. The conventional thinking was crudely Marxist and any disadvantage incurred by religious affiliation played no part in it. India was proud to be a secular state; the terror would come from the poor.  Only 10 years before, in the late 1960s, groups of bourgeois Kolkata students had travelled to a Bengal village called Naxalbari and fomented a small peasant revolt, murdering landlords, that eventually became the movement known as Naxalism (now resurgent in central India). An industrialist over the state border in Bihar told me as we sat one night on his terrace: ""One day they'll be coming over that wall with guns, no doubt of it.""  It didn't happen. India's internal conflicts took a different course, into communal identity and provincial self-determination, the Sikhs in Punjab and the Muslims in Kashmir, before economic liberalisation and middle-class prosperity gave most of its cities a persuasive sheen and five-star hotels ceased to be the preserve of expense-account businessmen and tourists and filled up with Indian families enjoying themselves.  But even in the worst times, the visitor never felt threatened. Brutality has a long history on the Indian subcontinent, just as it has in Europe, but it has rarely been directed at foreigners and even less often at foreign civilians. The terrorism associated with the independence movement usually took aim at soldiers and policemen, and was often incompetent - in 1932, to take a not-untypical example, two gunmen fired on the British editor of a Kolkata newspaper, missed at close range and drank cyanide. To find white fear of India - fear and its old chum, hatred - you need to go back as far as the Indian Mutiny in 1857, when 120 British women and children were captured at the siege of Cawnpore and then dismembered and stuffed down a well. It was one atrocity in what for both sides was a generally atrocious war. The result on the British side was a war cry, ""Remember Cawnpore!"", and a new intensity of racial bitterness and distrust, especially towards the Muslims who had led the revolt.  Those feelings eventually dissipated and we must hope they never return. In Mumbai, we have still no idea of where the gunmen came from or what they wanted to achieve (though as London's bombers came from Yorkshire, it could hardly be surprising if Mumbai's came from Kashmir). Our view of India, however, has surely been changed by the fact that many (though a minority) of this week's victims are European, with hotels chosen as targets because foreigners were likely to be there - ""helping"", as one Indian writer told the BBC, ""India to become rich"". Given the recent record of carnage in Mumbai - this week's toll of the dead is smaller than for the suburban train bombings of 2006 - our shock is at least partly ethnocentric. Mumbai may no longer be ""safe"" for us, but it hasn't been safe for ordinary Mumbaikars since the riots of 1992.  I saw a different city when I first stayed at the Taj in 1977 and looked out my window to the blue of the bay and the ships at anchor, blurred by the haze. It had half the population, was half as rich and half as crowded, and perhaps also half as criminal and half as corrupt. Its wealth still came from cotton mills and shipping. It had yet to be remade into one of the capitals of global finance, run politically - and peculiarly - by a party of Hindu chauvinists keen, as the writer Suketu Mehta observes, not just to decolonise the city's nomenclature but also to de-Islamise it. Its gothic railway station was still named after a British queen and not a Hindu king; it had still to become Mumbai. Its money has blinded people to a lot of faults. Now, it will be harder to see it as an essentially unthreatening city which mainly affects the visitor by troubling his conscience rather than his life. The glass in the hotel window has shattered. We should pray there are no riots.",Mumbai will never be the same again,2008-11-29T00:01:00Z,Ian Jack,world
"It was a perfect day for a bit of news burial, and so it proved. On Tuesday, while everyone was chewing over Alistair Darling's mixture of gain and pain, a British government began issuing ID cards for the first time in 56 years, though few people seemed to notice. As well as a spread of quiet news coverage, a small group of cultural and political high-ups - Neil Tennant of the Pet Shop Boys, Brian Eno and Shami Chakrabarti, the director of Liberty - warned of the damage to the UK's image abroad, and there were small protests in Liverpool and Cardiff, but that seemed to be it.  Maybe the prospect of the Tories taking power and honouring their pledge to scrap the scheme has dampened the anti-ID camp's ardour. For now, however, the government's aim - should Labour win the next election - of introducing the cards and a national identity register by stealth, seems to be proceeding to plan. From this week, students from outside the European Economic Area and the non-European spouses of accredited British residents will need to apply for a card and go on the register. The same will soon apply to millions of other foreign nationals and airport staff; and by some time in 2012, every applicant for a new passport will be joining up. From a panicky perspective, irrespective of what happens at the next election, it's not hard to see all this coming to pass thanks to the bureaucratic equivalent of the great German war machine - though if such comparisons suggest the state at its most clunky and Kafkaesque, the government is busy wrapping its ideas in shiny inclusive packaging. Last week, for instance, it announced that transgender people will be allowed to carry two cards at once. So, the madness continues, and even people in power seem either confused or opposed. In the past few months I have spoken to one government minister who claimed the project had effectively been kicked into the long grass, and another - no leftie - who optimistically sketched out how the Brown government might have decisively served notice of lean times and a bold new direction: scrapping the renewal of Trident and calling time on the ID scheme. Fat chance, it seems. Jacqui Smith's zeal seems undimmed: the plan is becoming more concrete and the Home Office's cost projections are being vigilantly updated. In keeping with the fashion for optimistic government forecasts, it puts the cost of a newly combined passport-ID scheme at slightly more than £5bn over 10 years, though plenty of voices predict anything up to three times that amount. Relative to the huge budgetary figures dancing before our eyes, that may still seem modest - but should you want to be mischievous with the official figures, it's not hard: £5bn is a quarter of what the government expects to take back before 2015/16 via tax rises. According to the Home Office's numbers, the annual cost of the plan will peak at about £525m - on today's figures, just over 75% of the yearly proceeds from the much-discussed 45% top tax rate. If the whole lot was brought forward, it would cover nearly two years of Labour's Building Schools for the Future programme.  Fiscal maths will surely inflame public opinion less than a more general complaint - that when times are tight this is exactly the kind of ill-advised cash magnet to avoid. If the era to come will be one of crackdowns on waste and anxious public audits, the Tesco mantra will be unanswerable: every little helps, and savings from the death of ID cards will be bigger than most. Here, perhaps, is the most useful argument against the scheme, and the key to the fight to come - not elegant tributes to the glories of the Liberal inheritance, or invocations of the Big Brother state, or even warnings from the more enlightened end of the Groucho Club - but something altogether more blunt: we simply can't afford it.john.harris@theguardian.com",John Harris: A way out of the ID folly,2008-11-28T00:01:00Z,John Harris,politics
"Barack Obama has already broken one promise. On the night he was elected, he issued a declaration that rebounded off the statues in Grant Park, Chicago and reverberated around the world: ""Change has come to America,"" he said.  Trouble is, it wasn't true. We're still waiting for change because Obama is not yet president. George Bush is still in the White House and will remain there for nearly 60 more days. The economy plunges ever deeper into crisis and yet Obama can do no more than stand and watch from afar, held back from the levers of power until January 20. Bush, meanwhile, gives lame ducks a bad name, still armed with the full authority of his office yet unable or unwilling to act while the economic crisis deepens. Obama defers to the notion that America has ""one president at a time"". Yet right now it seems to have no president at all, drifting and functionally leaderless at a time of dire need. The US constitution brims over with mechanisms of elegance and reason - but this three-month period of institutionalised limbo is not one of them.  That's partly why Obama gave his second press conference in two days yesterday, with another on the way today. It was a recognition that, in Bush's absence, someone had to get a grip. His performance at the podium - calm and steady - will have done much to reassure Americans that the grownups will soon be in charge. Just so long as they can wait.  But press conferences are only the most overt way in which Obama has signalled his intentions. Just as revealing has been the slew of staff and cabinet appointments since November 4 - all of them shedding crucial light on the Obama presidency to be. First, we know the new administration will break from the old by valuing expertise and experience - quite a contrast after eight years of cronyism. Remember, Bush named as his point man for national emergencies one Michael Brown, fresh from his post as the judges and stewards commissioner for the International Arabian Horses Association. Obama's early nominees, by contrast, each boast resumés either packed with long years of relevant service or luminous with academic prizes - or both. After John McCain threatened the world with a putative vice-president who seemed to regard her own ignorance as a credential for high office, and after he granted Joe the Plumber the status of chief adviser on taxation policy, it's a relief that the US will soon be run by people with qualifications to do the job.  Second, Obama is clearly determined to be no naive liberal, no wide-eyed neophyte who stumbles into town smiling at the locals even as they pick the wallet from his pocket and slip the watch off his wrist. He will not be Jimmy Carter or Bill Clinton, who brought in pals from their home states as unschooled as they were in the wiles of Washington. So while Clinton's first chief of staff was an Arkansas buddy from his kindergarten days - and hopelessly out of his depth in the nation's capital - Obama has turned to a man who has no fear of the DC shark tank, not least because he has some of the sharpest teeth. The notoriously hardball Rahm Emanuel was Obama's very first appointment, and with it the president-elect sent a clear message. That he does not want to be surrounded by people who are nice. He wants to be surrounded by people who are effective.  There is a deeper insight here too. Obama understands that servants need not be identical to their master, so long as they can implement his will. In Emanuel's case, the contrast in personality is useful: he can be bad cop to Obama's good cop. More widely, the incoming president is betting that he can still cast himself as the new broom come to sweep out the Augean stables, even when he's surrounded by a team of Washington insiders. So he has turned to the former Senate majority leader Tom Daschle, a Capitol Hill fixture, to reform healthcare. He wants someone who cannot be tripped up by the time-honoured, reform-thwarting tactics that are a way of life in Congress, someone who knows exactly how the machine works. The lesson of Carter, and especially Clinton - who tried to overhaul healthcare and failed dismally - is that the untainted outsider is a useful persona for an election campaign: it's not a qualification for a role in government.  This approach has, predictably, disappointed many of the Obama true believers on the liberal left. They are enraged by the proliferation of ex-Clintonites in the incoming administration, whether former treasury secretary Larry Summers as economic adviser in the White House - perhaps a holding position until the chairmanship of the Federal Reserve becomes vacant - or, most visibly, Hillary Clinton herself as secretary of state, an appointment expected to come after tomorrow's Thanksgiving holiday. Why, they ask, did we go to all that effort to elect Obama, if we end up with the same old Clinton crowd? That's not change we can believe in.  But this concern probably rests on a misreading of the way Obama sees his cabinet and circle of advisers. His longtime strategist David Axelrod gave the clearest clue at the weekend, when he said: ""He's not looking for people to give him a vision. He's going to put together an administration of people who can effectuate his vision."" In other words, he's not hiring Daschle or Summers or Clinton for their ideological colour. He's hiring them as political professionals who will take a brief - ultimately authored by him - and get the job done.  Perhaps that is a gamble on Obama's part, to imagine he can construct a progressive administration staffed by those in the centre and even on the centre-right. (Note that his expected national security adviser, the former marine General James Jones, backed John McCain, while Hillary supported the Iraq war.) But that is the bet he is making.  The traditional reading of this would be as a sign of weakness, suggesting Obama feels compelled - New Labour style - to keep right-leaning opinion on board. But it could just as easily be read as evidence of tremendous confidence: that he is sure enough in his own convictions to be surrounded by those who are far from nodding yes men. Bush could not tolerate any such dissent, once telling a luckless economics adviser that any decision the president made was, by definition, good policy. Obama has always invited argument, encouraging his aides to present different views. This must partly explain why he is so drawn to the precedent of Abraham Lincoln and his ""team of rivals"".  My own worries are, first, that at least one of Lincoln's biographers has written that the team ended up ""scheming and squabbling among themselves"". Second, more recent history suggests that secretaries of state, in particular, are only effective if world leaders believe there is no daylight between them and the president. Think Kissinger and Nixon, Baker and Bush Sr. Surely few will believe that of Obama and Hillary. Yet one senior Democrat tells me that this was a point explicitly discussed and agreed by the two former opponents last week, and that Hillary has won all that she asked for on that score - including ""constant and immediate access"" to Obama.  The Hillary nomination is the one that gives me pause. But the other signs are encouraging. The only real criticism of Obama's presidency? That it hasn't started yet. freedland@theguardian.com",Jonathan Freeland: Obama's choice of a team of rivals says much about the president he will be,2008-11-26T00:01:00Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"All is confusion. The political landscape of a world roiled by recession is all but unrecognisable. Voters stagger around like the cast of the now-revived TV drama Survivors, bewildered figures trying to make sense of a political geography where nothing stands where it used to be and nothing is as it was.  In this new topsy-turvy land, Labour earns Conservative disapproval for wanting to cut taxes, probably in next week's pre-budget report. For those who grew up understanding tax as perhaps the clearest dividing line between our two main parties - tax-and-spend Labour v tax-slashing Tories - this is truly baffling. What on earth is going on?  Gordon Brown says he is doing no more than following the basic Keynesian principle that the most useful tool for digging your way out of a recession is a chequebook: spending keeps up demand, which keeps the economic blood flowing even if it takes borrowing to do it. But there is as much politics here as economics. Brown knows that this crisis has brought him back from the dead. Yesterday's Mori survey showed Labour on 37%, just three points behind the Tories - and enough to make Labour the largest single party at the next election.  Part of it is the cling-to-mother impulse that sees voters sticking with leaders they know during an economic battering. But it's also a function of how the prime minister has presented himself since the collapse started in September. Whether knocking HBOS and Lloyds TSB heads together or coming up with a £37bn masterplan to save the banks, Brown has been busy. What's more, his plans have been hailed and aped in Europe and the US. The Nobel laureate Paul Krugman calls Brown the man who might just have ""saved the world financial system"".  But what happens when the immediate mood of crisis passes, and voters ask whether Brown's frenetic activity actually made any difference? If the answer is not much, he'll be finished. Yet success might not help, either. Voters could decide that Brown had served his purpose and was no longer needed. Think 1945: it was because Winston Churchill had won the war that Britons felt free to boot him out. So Brown needs it to be 1943 for as long as possible. He needs voters to believe the crisis is ongoing, that we are still in the emergency phase. Ideally, he would go into the next election as Dr Brown, still wearing his white coat, still administering medicine to the patient on life support. He doesn't want the patient sitting up, asking if all that treatment did any good. Not yet anyway.  It's for this reason that cabinet ministers are once again weighing up the merits of an early general election. They do it hesitantly, knowing the mess they all got into last time. But they can't help themselves: there's a Brown bounce in the polls that most thought they'd never live to see and they don't want to waste it.  So they dust off their precedents. Some look to the Thatcher landslide of 1983. ""The global downturn might be our Falklands,"" one minister mused to me this week. But the parlour game of choice is 1992, the year a long-serving government under a newish PM defied the polls and won a fourth term, in the teeth of a bad recession. In that period, say Brown allies, the moment of maximum economic and political danger was the autumn of 1990, when Thatcher was toppled. After that, it was all ""green shoots of recovery"" and the climb back upward. The optimists believe 2009 could work like that for Labour. Yes, there will be unemployment and repossessions. But the current anxiety will give way to relief among most people that they have, in fact, kept their job and their home. Inflation, interest rates and taxes will all be relatively low. Besides, they will be coming out of a recession that won't compare to the horrors of 1990-91, when inflation was in double digits and interest rates in the high teens.  Such are the musings in the Labour high command. They are full of contradictions - if it's not as bad as 1992, then maybe voters won't feel the need to cling to Brown as they did to Major - and fraught with risk. Chief among these is the abandonment of the very principle that distinguished New Labour: fiscal rectitude. This, after all, was what Brown and Blair were about. They promised to shake off forever the reputation for financial profligacy that had hobbled Labour. There would be no more wild spending. Brown wore a hairshirt as shadow chancellor and stuck to eye-watering Tory spending limits for his first two years in office simply to prove his probity. Now, at a stroke, all that has been discarded.  The Tories yesterday made the same move, in reverse. David Cameron had distinguished himself from his Tory predecessors by promising to stick to Labour's spending plans, hoping to demonstrate that the new compassionate Conservatives cared no less than Labour about the public services. He ditched that pledge yesterday, so that both New Labour and the new Conservatism have now lost their defining principles. In this respect, we have returned to the 1980s battelines: big spending Labour v low spending Tories.  The Tory calculus is just as complicated and risky as Labour's. Despite the closing poll gap, they have to cling to the belief that when the economy sours, voters - eventually - sour on governments. Similarly, they have clearly concluded that there is no mileage in acting as loyal partner in a spirit of national unity, as Cameron promised during his party conference. Instead, the opposition need to get back to opposing. Hence the stance against next week's tax cuts.  That certainly provides clarity after weeks in which the Tories have been all over the place. And it's a historic fit for the Tories to present themselves as the party of fiscal responsibility against Labour's ""reckless borrowing"".  But the risks are clear. First, they look like naysayers, shaking their heads and doing nothing while Brown zips from summit to summit saving the world. They do not have a detailed, costed and expert-backed recovery plan of their own. They are just saying no.  Second, they are at odds with not only Labour but most western governments and the IMF, all of whom believe a stimulus, even through unfunded tax cuts, is vital to get the economy working again. Third, they have pushed Gordon Brown right back into his comfort zone, the place where he most likes fighting elections. Now he can cast the newly prudent Tories as stingy Thatcherites bent on choking schools and hospitals with vicious spending cuts. We'll hear Brown's greatest hits all over again: investment v cuts, investment v cuts, repeat to fade.  Still, both parties are entering terrain that is almost entirely unfamiliar. The Tories are betting that Brown's package won't work or, if it does, it will only soften a still-painful blow. Labour are wagering that any cost their borrowing plan incurs will come years from now - and outside the electoral cycle. Labour are working on the assumption that the current crisis is so severe the usual rules don't apply. The Tories are hoping that the crisis has been overblown and that things will soon right themselves.  The truth is, neither side knows how this will play out. For right now our politicians are confused - just like the rest of us. freedland@theguardian.com","Jonathan Freedland: In this topsy-turvy political terrain, Dr Brown needs a long-term patient",2008-11-19T00:01:00Z,Jonathan Freedland,politics
"Recession, depression and deflation are depressing and deflating, hence their name. The daily rollcall of bad economic news starts to get under our collective skin. Our confidence about the future evaporates - and that, in turn, becomes part of the self-feeding downward vortex. It is obvious that the old order and the ideas that underpinned it are broken, and that there is nothing to replace it. Even the G20 communique after the Bretton Woods two summit last weekend was remarkable for its acceptance that the entire international financial system needs comprehensive reform. Given the situation, it could hardly say less. But it is shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted. It is not reform that is required in order to return to the status quo ante, it is the reconstruction of the global banking system, and beyond it the way we do capitalism. The London-New York financial axis no longer functions, nor do most of the institutions within it. It is not just that the business model of the UK's demutualised building societies or the US's investment banks is broken. It is that there is hardly an institution capable of lending in scale or of taking significant risks. The idea that this system has any potential to return to the days of pre-2007 is for the birds. Unless there is a robust story about how the UK economy is going to grow in future accompanied by decisive action, there is little chance of quickly turning round shattered business and consumer confidence. The starting point has to be a jettisoning of the pre-2007 assumptions about the boundaries and capacities of state and market. It is no longer plausible to argue that markets as systems do not make mistakes, or that governments are condemned to fail. The assumptions that allowed such conclusions - that individuals can rationally calculate and pursue self-interest, and that governments get in the way of that process - are wrong. In a paper Philippe Schneider and I have written for the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts, we argue that individuals' capacity for rational self-interest is limited, and that human beings are as much altruist as inherently selfish. Moreover democratic deliberation is as successful way of arriving at good collective decisions as markets are. This is not a call for a new statism. There is genius in markets' capacity for innovation, but society gets the best out of markets not when it sets them ""free"" but when they work with government in an interdependent relationship. What this means is that wealth generation is founded on innovation and invention across the real economy.  Fortunately the pace of invention in general-purpose technologies like the internet is accelerating, providing opportunities for new firms and jobs. But innovation is a delicate phenomenon. It thrives when there are imperfect markets that provide the chance for the innovator to collect above-average returns, compensating for costs and risks - a challenge to policymakers to chart a course between too much and too little competition. Almost no sustainable business model has been developed without government support. Wealth generation cannot be driven by financial services. Rather, because of its complexity, it is more susceptible to herd effects and irrationality than other parts of the economy. Consequently it constitutes an existential threat to capitalist wealth generation. It must be effectively regulated and strong lending and investment institutions created to compensate for inherent weaknesses. An intensification in the rate of disruptive, rapid technological change is best handled by a capitalism rooted in fair societies that limit inequality. Capitalism itself depends on trust and a willingness to stand by handshakes. Equally, ordinary citizens will only embrace change and potential loss of jobs if they have fair opportunity to benefit and to acquire assets to cushion themselves, and a strong welfare state to compensate them for financial risk. The evidence is overwhelming that trust and reciprocity are best fostered where reward and risk are distributed fairly. An innovative, responsive public sector is not a contradiction in terms. Government failure is correctable, and democracies are good at eliciting information and deliberating on courses of action, and are correlated with high growth. For instance, regulation often drives firms to make good decisions - like the German car industry investing in energy-efficient engines - or helps firms to avoid bad ones, like the trust gap that has opened up between the UK public and its weakly regulated financial institutions. It is these principles that will underpin economic growth in future. The best way to fight a recession is to convince business and consumer alike that there is a road map for a prosperous future, and that measures taken today are part of building a viable tomorrow. The government should start with its pre-budget report on Monday. • Will Hutton is chief executive of the Work Foundation.

"As if Britain didn't have enough problems, do we now have to deal with the isolationist teenager? Zac Beattie's Cutting Edge documentary, Rich Kid, Poor Kid, featured two teenage girls living on the same London street, one middle class and privately educated (Alice); the other, Natalie, poor, living in a rundown council flat, no longer in school. And while Natalie was no inspirational Kelly Holmes, Alice took the rancid biscuit - drooling over who she knew on the rich list, and ranting about 'state-school kids' and 'chavs', for whom she clearly had nothing but contempt, even before they mugged her for her mobile phone. 'I don't give a shit what state-school kids do,' declared Alice. 'They can all die for all I care.' What a charming young lady. And, unfortunately, far from unusual. Are we incubating the first-ever generation of teenagers who hate, despise, and avoid each other, for no better reason than money? The shocking thing about Alice is not that she is an aberration, an extreme, but that she fits right in. While I used to think the problem with 'yoof' was their lack of curiosity about other generations, Alice proves they have just as little interest in each other. That is, outside their own rigid social circles, which still seem to revolve endlessly, toxically, around who is or isn't a 'chav'. Even my own daughter bitches with her mates about 'chavs' - when, as I keep telling them, with their constant texting, matted hair, and tragic posing with cigs on Facebook, they're the biggest bunch of 'chavs' I've ever seen. But they are angels compared to 'gels' like Alice. It isn't just the snobbery that's so unnerving; it's the gloating pride these youngsters seem to take in their frankly bog-ordinary middle-class existences, twinned with disgust at the very idea of poverty or struggle. Not only is this youthful middle-class isolationism depressing, it's also surely new? It seems to me that previous generational tribes revolved around one's own youthful musical/cultural concerns (mods, rockers, teds, punks, ravers, etc). Any attempt to forge an identity based on where your parents were in life would have resulted in mockery and social death, everywhere outside the Bullingdon Club. With this new tribe of isolationist teenagers, for the first time everything seems to centre, not on one's own enthusiasms, but on a pathetic dependence on Mummy and Daddy's social status. More worryingly, and evident from Alice's initial reaction to Natalie ('Butters!' - translation, 'ugly'), there seems to be a corrosive lack of empathy for generational peers who don't have it so good. Time was posh kids over-empathised with poorer, more streetwise peers, to the point where they tried to emulate them. (What one might term the Tim Westwood syndrome.) And though laughable in retrospect, at least this showed some respect and sympathy for the less well off, where now there seems to be indifference or contempt. What the likes of Alice have to realise is that, if this social 'inbreeding' continues, they'll end up the 'poorer' for it. It would be unfair to place all these ills at Alice's door (at 15, not many of us would shine in a documentary). However, she and other chattering-class isolationists must not let what Alice belatedly and correctly identified as 'fear' ruin their big chance. After all, teenage is a golden time when, independent of thought yet unshackled by adult responsibility, you can truly test your boundaries, question 'stuff', be the most vital and luminescent you're ever going to be. Do they really want to waste this trapped in rigid little cliques, drowning in their own sour superiority? When they could do what the rest of us do - save it for middle age. Maybe they do. But if Alice has any sense, she'll see herself in this documentary, and realise that, just like the song, she doesn't want to 'live there' any more. Call me a Philistine, but a virtual trip to Ancient Rome sure beats the experience of schlepping round a ruin Techno-history nerds, try to remain calm: Google Earth, the 3D map people, have produced a virtual trip back to Ancient Rome, circa AD320. The city has been reconstructed in painstaking detail, so that virtual time-travellers can hang out everywhere, from the Forum of Caesar, to the Colosseum in its prime.  All of which sounds a trifle lazy - Sims for people who can't be bothered to fly. Not to mention culturally stunted. When it is still possible to stand in the crumbling ruins of the Colosseum, inhaling the spirit of the ages, feeling past civilisations churn in the dust beneath your feet, what kind of spiritually emaciated moron would prefer to drag a mouse around a virtual version? Well, me, for one. Shameful as it may be to admit, I probably would prefer virtual Ancient Rome to schlepping around the modern-day ruins. Quite apart from anything else, there'd be less scope for disappointment.  Is it just me, or do other people end up feeling short-changed when they finally get to see the 'sights'? It seems to be an issue of 'tourist oversell'. The Eiffel Tower is raved about to the extent that when you finally see it, it slightly resembles rusty Meccano. The Empire State Building - all very well, unless there's 'low visibility', in which case, you get to the top, feeling you've forked out for a very long lift ride.  For me, the biggest letdown was Pompeii. I'd yearned to see this from childhood; ghoulishly imagining lava-encrusted people, solidified, as they screamed, ran and died. Books had certainly given the impression that you could see people 'lava-ed' in situ. What was actually there? Some crumbly walls and a few 'mosaic fragments'. No lava-people crawling up hills, or lava-mules looking astonished. Nothing. 'We've been sold a pup here,' I said to my companion, as we shared a cheese roll and a fag in some fallen-down amphitheatre.  Are people like me guilty of promoting Philistinism? Probably. Certainly on our return from Pompeii, a friend, a classics scholar, declared us 'peasants, who should have opted for Euro Disney'. Or (hey!) maybe I just see both sides of the argument. On the one hand, we can't invite in a culture where the very concept of 'ancient history' is when Madonna first met Guy. Ancient history must remain genuinely ancient. That said, there's a definite market for Google Earth's 'new' Ancient Rome. Peasants we may be, but for those weary of 'tourist oversell', sometimes the 'real thing' might not be quite 'real' enough. I'm a witchetty grub ... Get me out of Dani Behr's mouth Looking forward to the return of I'm A Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here, tonight? I wish I were. Indeed, may I offer a bottle of fizz (from one of the better Threshers, none of your rubbish) to the first jungle celeb who point-blank refuses to eat witchetty grubs, stick insects, kangaroo testicles, et al, in the Bushtucker trials.  For a great show, the casual animal cruelty ruins it. I can't be the only one appalled to see living creatures popped into stupid celebrity mouths and chomped to death just for the sake of TV?  This kind of thing must be having a coarsening effect. It says something that it is provided as 'family entertainment'. Meanwhile, the RSPCA is wondering why gratuitous animal cruelty is on the rise.  Couldn't they find something nauseating and amusing for them to eat that doesn't involve cruelty?  Delicacies such as wallaby dung? Rat ejaculate? Snake vomit?  Or the reality gloves could really come off. Dani Behr forced to drink Robert Kilroy-Silk's still-warm urine. I could live with that.  Who am I kidding? I'd vote for it. I'm A Celebrity ... makers, kindly take note: those of us against animal cruelty are not necessarily against celebrity cruelty.  Far from it.

"A new play by David Hare is a social as well as a dramatic event - if these two aspects of theatre can ever be separated - and on Wednesday the little Cottesloe auditorium at the National was sold out for the second night of Gethsemane. The title comes from the garden where Jesus suffered his anguish of doubt on the night before the crucifixion. The play is Hare's 14th production for the National in a career at the South Bank that began with Plenty in 1978.  I have seen a few of them, beginning with Pravda (written with Howard Brenton) in 1985, but I imagine that the Guardian's critic, Michael Billington, has seen all of them, so when he wrote in a review on Wednesday's front page that Gethsemane ""stands comparison with Hare's very best work"", and as Guardian readers could be described as Hare's core audience, his words lengthened the queue for returns. I got there early and sat with a glass of wine. Three people at the next table were discussing Napoleon's march on Moscow, learnedly. ""The fruits of victory are often the culture of a country, aren't they?"" said a woman with close-cropped silver hair. Her partner agreed. Like many, perhaps most, of the audience, they looked to be in their 60s. Like all of the audience, they were white. I don't say this critically, chastising the National for its lack of outreach. I've often wondered what the world would be like if it were run by the people who regularly attend the South Bank, the London Library and the Sunday morning chamber music at the Wigmore Hall: better, I think, at least for a while. The interesting thing was how the audience seemed to have changed at the interval. How low our high minds had got.  ""Wasn't it Jack Straw's son who was selling drugs?"" ""He was home secretary at the time."" ""Yes, and then there was that Blair boy. Remember? The police found him on the ground vomiting in Leicester Square.""  Other names flitted about the bar: Tessa Jowell, her lawyer husband David Mills, the Labour fundraiser, Lord Levy. The author insists in a programme note that Gethsemane is ""pure fiction"" and therefore, as the third in a recent series of his plays inspired by public events, different to The Permanent Way (about railway privatisation - ""pure fact transcribed,"" writes Hare) and Stuff Happens (the Iraq invasion - ""one third transcribed, two-thirds imagined""). His scrupulousness in apportioning the fractions of fact to fiction in his work is admirable but ""fact"" and ""fiction"" can be slippery ideas, especially for an audience who have come, thanks to the play's pre-publicity, to see a drama à clef about cash for honours and other Labour scandals. Hare's prime minister, Alec Beasley, relaxes at home with a drum kit. His home secretary, Meredith Guest, has a dodgy entrepreneur as a husband and an unhappy daughter whose escapade with sex and drugs becomes a newspaper scoop. Otto Fallon, the prime minister's fundraiser and squash partner, started life as a hairdresser in Hendon and then made money out of boy bands. The parallel habits and histories of real people are obvious enough in general - substitute guitar for drums and tennis for squash - and sometimes precise: Jack Straw's son was trapped by a Daily Mirror reporter trying to buy cannabis from him, just as the daughter of Hare's home secretary is exposed by a reporter (presumably from the Daily Telegraph; the proprietor is on trial for fraud) who has sex with her.  Hare may not have wanted us to care too much about these details of plot and characterisation. Rather than to cause a frisson of recognition - impossible now, in any case, given that half of us think Tony Blair is Michael Sheen - they may be there simply to demonstrate that the play does correspond to an external reality; to show us that events like these, though not quite these, have really happened. But the effect on the audience by half time was an odd one.  Later in the play, the home secretary asks of Lori, the music teacher-turned-busker, who represents decent human aspiration: ""Do you read the Daily Mail?"" No, says Lori. ""You're right. Nobody reads the Daily Mail. But everybody looks at it. You can't read it ... that's not what it's there for."" In my experience this isn't true (if I buy it, I read it), but the line got a few lofty chuckles - from an audience that by the interval was searching its collective memory for typical Daily Mail stories. If Gethsemane does nothing else, it reminds us of what we are really like: indiscriminate consumers of scandals that shouldn't be (the Blair boy, the Straw boy) as well of scandals that certainly should. Of course, Hare wants it to do more. Lori and her husband Mike, who goes to work for the fundraiser, are struggling to make sense of a party and government whose philosophy is ""what works"" and where only money counts. Mike bemoans ""a general sense of weirdness - wars which last forever and are going nowhere, and policies which are just rhetoric"", a voice that reflects Hare's own well-known alienation from the Labour government. ""The whole experience of being a sentient adult in the western world in 2003,"" he wrote in the Guardian in 2003, ""has involved being forced to stand to one side, watching in disbelief, while the governments of two English-speaking countries undertook massively unpopular policies with exactly the consequences which all intelligent bystanders foresaw.""  Honours, as in cash for honours, are never mentioned. Perhaps the lawyers have been at work. So why do tycoons give money to the Labour party? What do they get out of it? The home secretary eventually reveals the answer to Mike, who must be the holiest fool in Christendom. ""They get low tax. It isn't said, but that's what they get. A business-friendly environment. That means low tax. Put it another way: they give money to keep their money."" Well, well.  The applause at the end was brief, two tepid rounds for the actors who played their parts so well, and then we all went home; which suggested that more of the audience agreed with the play's uglier reviews (""more like a dramatisation of a lengthy article in the New Statesman"" - Daily Telegraph) than they did with Michael Billington.  ""The ignorant and foolish critic is the one who sneers that nothing dates faster than the up-to-date"": Hare wrote that a few years ago, but the opposite is the problem here. Gethsemane hasn't had time to date. Brand new, it is not up-to-date enough. When was the Straw boy? 1997. The Blair boy? 2000. True, Tessa Jowell and her separated husband are still with us, and the fundraising investigations involving Lord Levy are only a couple of years old, but we now seem separated from that age by a wall, as if we'd moved from a comfortable sitting room, where the conversation regretted certain features of politics, into a chilly kitchen where our only occupation is to take our own money from a drawer and count it. In Gethsemane, nobody is worried about the mortgage or the sack and we are still examining our moral dilemmas, quite comfortably, by the fire. The terror has still to arrive.  I hate to say this. In Hare, Britain is lucky to have a playwright who in his documentary work puts public enlightenment above self-indulgence, and sees in theatre a place where the public can go ""to see the currency of present-day life set before them and, in intention at least, given some sort of shape"". In times to come, when the real stories behind it are as obscure as Macbeth's, Gethsemane may even be seen as a good play. What it isn't is a play for today.",Ian Jack: It's as if we've moved from a warm living room into a chilly kitchen,2008-11-15T00:01:00Z,Ian Jack,politics
"Belle de Jour, the ""real life"" prostitute, who wrote the ""real life"" blog that was turned into a ""real life"" book, that became the ""real life"" (kind of) TV drama with Billie Piper, has written a novel. In a piece entitled The twilight world of tart-lit, the Independent reported that De Jour (I've decided it's a surname) told Mark Lawson, in an email interview, that the putatively fictional work was ""about 75% ... true"". The piece goes on to accuse her of ""having it all ways"", but it strikes me that 75% is a relatively low truth:fiction ratio for a first novel. Anyway, back to the sex industry: this, I believe, is the most contentious ""woman's"" issue left. Considering it's the oldest profession in the world, you'd have thought we would have arranged ourselves along an axis by now, but no. Is it acceptable to coin ""tart-lit"" in this easy, accepting way, as though it's as legitimate a branch of middlebrow culture as sci-fi? Is it humourless to object? I'm divided. When I wrote about lapdancing clubs and the planning legislation that had refashioned them from sex shops to coffee shops with extra nudity, I got emails whose vehemence amazed me. Some were from nutters, granted. (One railed against me for citing a Lilith magazine survey on rapes, and called it ""statistically insignificant"" that there were 76 rapes in the London borough of Camden in one year. Statistically insignificant! 76 rapes in one year! In one borough! From a Guardian reader!) But many apparently reasonable people said in effect that if we accept sex has no stigma, if we insist sex is not exploitation, what's wrong with selling it. And broadly, I agree with that. I agreed with that when I interviewed Billie Piper, and we talked for longer about the free knickers she'd got than about the ethics surrounding the industry. What occurs to me at this stage in our collective sex-industry awakening is that it has been divided into three strata: high-class hookers are just liberated women who happen to be better at sex than they are at anything else; Ipswich-area-type hookers are women who do it from drug-driven desperation and thereby attract the wrong clientele; proper low-life sex industry hookers, with no agency (personal agency, I mean, not an escort agency), are essentially kidnapped women, or if not kidnapped, so disadvantaged that they may as well have been kidnapped.  The moral endpoint is that, as a person using sex industry workers, you are OK so long as you pay top dollar. If you pay enough, then you are just one half of a fair transaction; and if you pay zilch, you are an exploiter and a misogynist. The mainstream acceptability of prostitution, in TV and publishing and newspapers, promulgates this message.  This brings prostitution squarely into line with all other employment - there is nothing inherently wrong with employing people per se, it becomes wrong when you don't pay them enough and exist on their labour happily knowing that they are living in poverty.  The reason this argument always unravels, though, is violence. No feminist - first, second or third wave - can endorse prostitution because disproportionately often it has a violated or dead woman at the end of it. To get turned on by someone's desperation, or at least aroused in its close proximity, makes you by definition a nasty person. I actually think this is ungendered - I would say the same about female sex tourists trading on the hardship of Cubans (or similar).  So there is no way of rehabilitating this industry for the modern sensibility. It will always contain a lot of nasty people, and no amount of high-class hookers will change that. In the end, I don't think we should be fawning over ""tart-lit"" and making cute names for it. There are good grounds for moral censure, which we are mad to forget. mszoewilliams@yahoo.co.uk",Zoe Williams: Belle de Jour cannot rehabilitate the sex industry for the modern sensibility,2008-11-13T00:01:00Z,Zoe Williams,society
"That noise you've been hearing for the past week, the one that began in the United States last Tuesday before spreading throughout the world? That's the sound of a global sigh of relief. It contained a cry of joy too, of course, especially among black Americans and people of colour across the globe, seeing a man who looks like them ascend, at last, to the highest office in the world. But history will record November 4 2008 not only as the day when America elected its first black president, but as the moment when one of the bleakest chapters in the postwar era drew to a close.  How else to explain scenes - on the streets of Athens and Nairobi as well as Washington and New York - of jubilation that are surely without precedent in the democratic world? What I saw in Grant Park, Chicago, last week felt more akin to South Africa in 1994 or Berlin in 1989 than a normal response to a regular election. The dancing till the small hours, the honking of car horns, the tearful hugs between strangers, these are images we associate with peaceful revolutions, the celebrations that might follow the ejection of a loathed regime.  Perhaps that is how many Americans - and hundreds of millions around the globe - do indeed see the election of Barack Obama. For the past eight years, I regularly argued against the claim that anti-Americanism was on the rise in Europe and beyond. On the contrary, I said, most Britons and Europeans remained remarkably well-disposed to the United States: it was just the Bush administration they couldn't stand.  The global reaction last week suggested I wasn't wrong. Witness the sheer speed with which - once George Bush had been dispatched - the citizens of the world rushed to embrace America once more. It turns out the world was not just ready but eager for the US to lead again; it just didn't want Bush to do the leading.  The result is that the most pressing questions of international life now stand in a wholly new light. Part of that is the warm, amber glow of affection, verging on adulation, for President-elect Obama. (He is surely the first politician since Nelson Mandela whose face can be worn on a T-shirt without embarrassment.) But it's more substantive than that.  Take the conflict that defined the age of Bush, the ""war on terror"". Instantly, that conflict is changed in character. It becomes much harder for violent jihadists to demonise the United States when the Land of the Great Satan is led by Barack Hussein Obama, whose African step-grandmother is still a practising Muslim. Before he has signed a single executive order, the president-elect has won a decisive battle in the propaganda war. It's not only Obama's name that will make the lives of jihadism's recruiters harder. He reportedly aims to order a planned withdrawal of US forces from Iraq, phased over 16 months, within a few weeks of taking office. As Obama vowed in the very last rally of his campaign - an extraordinarily atmospheric, late-night address to nearly 100,000 people standing in what was little more than an empty field in Manassas, Virginia - ""I will end this war."" What's more, Obama is open to negotiation in a way that separates him from his predecessor. In Afghanistan, the talk now is of finding ""reconcilables"": Taliban fighters who are not motivated by hardcore ideology and might be induced to lay down their weapons. Obama took plenty of heat for it in the campaign, but he maintains the same willingness to talk to Iran and Syria.  And yet liberals and anti-war types should not declare the new president a kindred spirit too hastily. As Obama himself said in the now famous 2002 speech denouncing the Iraq adventure: ""I am not opposed to all wars."" It's true that he avoids the phrase ""war on terror"". But that is not because he thinks there is no war to be fought. His disagreement with Bush was that the latter had failed to define America's enemy clearly. It was not an abstract noun - terror - but a specific organisation with a specific leader, namely al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden. Indeed, one of Obama's central critiques of the 2003 invasion of Iraq was that it diverted attention and resources from the true fight - against the men who had actually attacked the US on September 11 2001.  So peaceniks should not be surprised to read the report in yesterday's Washington Post that Obama ""intends to renew the US commitment to the hunt for Osama bin Laden"". It's not only that Obama scored crucial political points with his unbending stance in the televised debates - ""We will kill Bin Laden. We will crush al-Qaida"" (a Democrat, for once, outhawking a Republican on national security). That position also happens to fit with Obama's genuine view of the threat to America's safety.   Having placed al-Qaida back in the centre of America's gunsights, the new president aims to defeat it, taking the fight to al-Qaida's enablers in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Even as he pulls troops out of Iraq, Obama aims to send thousands more to fight the Taliban. He was ahead of Bush in calling for the theatre of operations against al-Qaida to be expanded beyond the Afghan borders to include the tribal areas of western Pakistan where many believe Bin Laden is holed up. Put simply, Obama is no dove. He is just a much smarter hawk, his eye more sharply focused.  The new disposition on Iran is similarly nuanced. The noises are much less warlike. Obama promises diplomacy and dialogue, and relegates force to where it should be: a last, not a first, resort. But his own advisers counsel that Obama is firm on this matter. He has concluded that Tehran cannot be allowed to become a nuclear power, not least because it would trigger a regional arms race. He will use negotiation to thwart that possibility. But if that fails, the use of force remains an option.  And that's when the new global context could make all the difference. Imagine if John McCain had toured European capitals, trying to assemble a coalition for strikes against Iran. He'd have barely got a hearing. Two million people would have marched in London waving banners declaring: ""We won't get fooled again."" But if Obama were to make the case, explaining that he had seen through the nonsense of Iraqi WMD but that the Iranian threat was real, he would surely earn a very different response. In that sense if no other, armed international action against Iran might be more achievable under an Obama presidency than it would have been otherwise.  Other areas are more straightforward. On climate change, a denier in the White House has been replaced by a believer. Tellingly, Obama's proposed bail-out of the American auto industry does not propose chucking money at Detroit to keep churning out the same old cars. Instead, Democrats want a loan programme to help the auto companies start making fuel-efficient vehicles. That fits with Obama's wider approach to the economic crisis - to see it as an opportunity to spend money to make America greener.  In every sphere, Obama marks a break from the recent past. He will not be perfect; the disappointments will be real and may come soon. But for now, at least, we are entitled to that sigh of relief - and even the odd yelp of joy.  • freedland@theguardian.com",Jonathan Freedland: The president-elect is not a dove - he is just a much smarter hawk,2008-11-12T00:01:00Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"Are we seriously supposed to buy into the 'Sarah Effect'? And would this be entirely fair on Sarah Brown?  The Labour win in Glenrothes has been widely credited to the PM's wife, who, alongside her husband, flouted byelection convention to knock on doors and persuade people into the booths. The result has been hailed as proof of Sarah's quasi-messianic appeal, first noted when she jumped on to the stage to introduce Brown at the Manchester conference. You can just imagine the excited plotting around the Westminster watercooler: how to employ the Sarah Effect to, well, best effect? Indeed, the only question no one seems to be asking about the Sarah Effect is what effect might it end up having on Sarah?  I have nothing against Sarah Brown. In fact, I admire her - she seems decent, bright and without a self-pitying streak to be seen. It's crucial when you consider she has a son with cystic fibrosis, a disease reputed to be as cruel (and labour-intensive) on the parent as it is on the child. With this in mind, it's been surreal to read gushing tributes to how Sarah has been tramping along streets, ringing bells, making calls and generally working 'astonishingly hard'. (And her normal home life is just one long spa?) However, as much as I like Mrs Brown, and can appreciate her doorstep appeal, I can't bring myself to believe in the Sarah Effect.  When you think about it, the idea of Sarah 'winning Glenrothes' is insulting on an array of levels. The public are instantly demoted from sentient adult voters to starstruck simpletons: 'Well, I disliked Brown, but now his wife has appeared on my doorstep in a chunky knit, and smiled at me in a pleasant way, I will vote for him.' Likewise, Labour candidate, Lindsay Roy might be forgiven for feeling that his own campaigning efforts weren't too shoddy.  Then there is Gordon Brown himself - whose recent handling of the financial crisis is probably the real reason people swung back to Labour. All of which points to the fact that there was no Sarah Effect as such. And that even a couple of months ago, Sarah Brown could have cartwheeled down the streets of Glenrothes in her bra and pants, and Labour would still have lost (though we'd have got some great pictures).  In truth, the much-heralded Sarah Effect may be just another symptom of a babyish desire to turn everything into political panto, where spouses are only good for being cheered, or booed at. Already Michelle Obama is being Cherie-fied, all those criticisms of her black-and-red dress mere code for: 'We're coming to get you!' In the same week, Sarah is deemed to have 'won' the Glenrothes byelection. How flattering. Until she finds herself wheeled out for everything, and perhaps scapegoated when things go wrong. This is the main reason I refuse to believe in the Sarah Effect. Not only is the concept nebulous, it is simply not fair on her.  The public are not idiots - we are unlikely to vote for or against someone because of their spouse. No one ever claimed that Denis kept Maggie in power. Political spouses do not have anything like this kind of power. Nor should they. Just as it was bizarre when Mary Archer seemed to sway a court case all those years ago (the judge deciding she was too 'fragrant' for Jeffrey to cheat on), surely it would be plain weird for the 'Sarah Effect' to have won over Glenrothes. Gordon Brown has more than proved himself in recent weeks, and should have faith in himself and his party. Indeed, if he seriously believes the Sarah Effect is the key reason for Glenrothes, and his 'bounce' generally, he is not only wrong, he is downright pathetic, and should resign immediately. As for Sarah Brown, no one is saying she shouldn't take pride in being an asset to her husband - the anti-Cherie, if you will. However, she should also guard against being flattered into believing in the Sarah Effect. She has quite enough on her plate already - let the real politicians take the glory and the blame. All hail Astley's army for turning rock music inside out On being appointed visiting professor of music at Salford University, Johnny Marr, former guitarist with the Smiths, announced that the music industry, especially shows such as X Factor, 'do nothing to advance the creative power of pop'. 'Nothing has ever been created of value by the British or American music industries,' said Marr. Then, before you could say Motown, Def Jam, Stiff, Factory or Rough Trade, Marr went on to say that the true innovators of music were always 'outsiders': 'People [who] out of necessity, rejection or frustration, with talent and vision, built their own ark and sailed it alongside the music industry.' What to say? Except that, while anyone with hearing reveres the talented Marr, sadly, this time, he appears to be talking out of his ark. In truth, one of the most amusing things about 'real musicians' is that they're rarely the outsiders of legend. Most of them couldn't be more insider, forever refusing to allow other bands and artists into their sacred cliques, because they are not 'real' or 'cool' enough. Hence the true outsiders of British music are bands such as Coldplay, selling millions, despite being pooh-poohed by official outsiders as uncool. Meanwhile, Pete Doherty eats beans out of a can, because, despite being the ultimate rebel outsider, 99 per cent of his output sounds like methadone-soaked Squeeze. As for talent-show contestants, surely they are the biggest outsiders of all. I still feel prickles of shame recalling Pop Stars group HearSay being viciously booed at the Brit Awards - denounced as fake by smug, bloated music-industry drunks - just like me, except I would never sink so low as to bully young kids excited by their big break. Similarly with this year's X Factor. To my mind, there is more soul and romance in the idea of fragile, Kate Bush-esque Diana Vickers warbling in her Blackburn bedroom, daring to dream, than there is to a hundred outsiders leaning on their Les Pauls, droning away about how real they are. Maybe this is why it seems so funny that fans of Rick Astley, left, have 'Rickrolled' MTV into awarding him best act ever- tricking millions into clicking the 'Never Gonna Give You Up' video and outscoring U2, the Beatles et al. Arks aside, Professor Marr couldn't deny that this is one award that went to a true outsider. Now, Kim Jong-il really knows how to touch up a photo After not being seen for months, and with rumours he may have suffered a stroke, or even be dead, North Korean leader Kim Jong-il has been photographed, alive and well, standing unaided, alongside some troops. Or - cue tinkly Twilight Zone music - has he? Some are saying the photographs have been faked using computer wizardry (it's something to do with how the shadows fall, apparently). Similarly, Kate Winslet, who once fumed at being 'slimmed' by GQ, insists that only her skin tones were altered in the current issue of Vanity Fair. Thank God - we've all been really worried about that... or (more TZ music) have we? Truth is, women pretend to find the idea of retouching completely abhorrent, but secretly we'd all prefer to sacrifice our first born to Lucifer than allow some ghastly, fat, spotty photo to appear on a magazine cover. So why should there be a different rule for celebrities? In short, retouch away, ladies, and don't spare the brushes. Still, it's typical, isn't it? As the Kim photos may prove, as soon as men get into retouching, they're not content with flawless skin or fluffy hair - they have to take it to a whole new level, faking 'being able to stand up', perhaps even 'life itself'. All in all, it makes what GQ did to Kate Winslet's thighs look positively small fry.",Barbara Ellen: To pin Labour's hopes on Sarah Brown is absurd,2008-11-09T00:01:00Z,Barbara Ellen,politics
"For the last eight years, it's been hard to keep the flame alive. Those of us who have admired America since childhood - seeing it as endlessly fascinating, brimming with energy and founded on the deeply radical ideal of self-government - felt increasingly beleaguered after 2001. How to admire the land of ""you're with us or against us"", embodied by a president with a cowboy swagger, waging a fraudulent war and threatening to choke the planet by belching out a quarter of the world's CO2 and damn the consequences? America became Bush country, its national symbol no longer the Statue of Liberty but Abu Ghraib. The flame was sputtering out. But on Tuesday night I stood in Grant Park and watched a crowd of 200,000 erupt as they saw Barack Obama become America's next president. From now on, admiration for the US will no longer need to be whispered nor weighed down with a thousand qualifiers.  Start with the obvious. The US can now claim to be a leader not a laggard in the business of overcoming racial prejudice. Of course, it has not and could not absolve in a single night the original sin of slavery and two centuries of racism; that stain is there forever. And of course structural inequalities remain: a US government analysis projects that one in three of African-American boys born in 2001 will spend some time in prison during their lives. Still, on Tuesday the US leapt ahead of those countries that had long regarded it as trapped by a bigoted past. Does anyone seriously believe France or Germany or Britain is about to have a non-white leader?  But it's not just the result of the US election that is inspiring. The election itself revealed America to be among the most politically engaged nations on earth. For two years, the electorate paid close attention to a sustained argument about their future. The party conventions, like the 90-minute debates, drew bigger audiences than the Olympics and the Oscars. Blogs and cable TV shows that obsessed over the tiniest detail of the campaign built loyal followings. Those of us outside the US, living in societies bedevilled by apathy and low turnout, can only look on in envy.  If I'm honest, there were always some aspects of America that were easier to admire than others. The ""red-state"" America of God and guns can be bewildering, its attitudes to those deemed ""different"" often appalling. That country has not gone away. But it is no longer dominant. Its political wing - the Republican party - has been beaten back to the south and mountain west.  That represents more than a defeat for a political party. It reflects a demographic shift. The rural, all-white, smalltown America personified by Sarah Palin was outnumbered on Tuesday by the Obama nation: younger, urban and suburban, and richly diverse. Palin may despise the cities and the coasts, the New Yorks and Californias and university towns - but that is the America the rest of the world treasures. And now it is in the ascendant.  It's also possible that an Obama administration could become the closest thing progressives have to a model. The US now has a leader committed to raising the taxes of the rich, combating climate change and promoting active government. What other country can make that boast? Certainly not Britain.  Best of all, the American people proved something about itself. That it could see through the polarising tricks of Karl Rove politics - casting any Democrat as alien, suspect and unpatriotic. Those tactics had worked so many times before, but not this time. Americans realised they faced grave problems and needed to rise above the petty, cultural warfare of the past. It suggests America has not lost its talent for renewal, even redemption. As an earlier European admirer of the US De Tocqueville once put it, ""The greatness of America lies not in being more enlightened than any other nation, but rather in her ability to repair her faults."" For that reason alone, my faith has been restored.",Jonathan Freedland: 'America has not lost its talent for renewal - even redemption',2008-11-08T00:01:00Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"Have you ever heard Rolf Harris's version of Led Zeppelin's Stairway to Heaven? It has a didgeridoo solo, and is not widely acknowledged to be a masterpiece. Bless Rolf, though, because years after its release, he revealed he'd never actually heard the original when he came to record it. ""And when I did,"" he confessed in horror, ""I thought: 'Oh my God, what have I done?'"" As they watched Barack Obama's inspiring acceptance speech this week, one wonders how many politicians, and even ex-politicians, experienced a similarly sobering, gut-sinking sense if not of their own inadequacy in the face of the gold standard, then at least of the manner in which the public discourse has been allowed to bump along at the level of the banal and unedifying for what suddenly seems so long. Our own Mr Tony Blair used to fancy himself as a bit of an orator, of course, but when Bill Clinton followed the PM's speech with one of his own at the Labour conference a couple of years ago, some were moved to make analogies along the lines of it being a bit like Robbie Williams opening for Frank Sinatra. Indeed, by the time Mr Blair took his leave of Downing Street, most people thought his tremulous reading from Corinthians at Princess Di's funeral wasn't quite up to the rave reviews it received at the time. (It is a matter of the pettiest pride that I thought him a monumental ham even then, but as the more notable horrors of the Blair years began to unfold, petty pride was all one had to sustain oneself.) Obama's extraordinary oratory this week made people feel less jaded, but simultaneously less willing to humour those who had made them feel so jaded in the first place. Many will have smarted anew at the terrible squandering of New Labour's mandate in 1997, sensing that the president-elect realises there are rather more pressing things to do than organise cocktail parties for pop stars; or, to use a more up to date example, that there are nobler ways to spend one's time than messing about on oligarchs' boats. His task is far more monumental than any facing the politicians who indulged in those pursuits; and it is a sad inevitability that Obama's burnished aura will tarnish. I suspect, however, that he won't turn out to be a crook or a warmonger or any of the other fates that befall tinnier idols, just as he won't lose his gift for oratory, no matter how many bits of bad news he will have to rely upon it to impart. But right now it doesn't really matter either way, because this week people were reminded of what an inspiring politician sounds like, and how he carries himself. Excellence is a useful reference point. While that memory remains fresh in the public mind, people will be measuring their own leaders against it - the very leaders now seeking to be Obama's best friend. And unless they raise their game, and - most urgently - the tone of the debate, these Facebook stalkers of global politics are playing a risky strategy even mentioning him, on account of the comparison doesn't exactly flatter them. You might argue that the Punch and Judy show of prime minister's questions did not benefit from its place in the schedules this week, coming less than eight hours after that historic display in Chicago. Similarly, that Hazel Blears should have chosen this epic week to make a speech asserting that a corrosive cynicism is causing disengagement from politics is an irony that has been remarked upon. The communities secretary lamented the ""vicious nihilism"" of some bloggers, yet watching PMQs you had to think: I wonder where they learn that from? Witless snidery is inbuilt at the highest levels of our political system. It's less pronounced when the White House incumbent can barely get his words in the right order, but if Obama carries on in this engaging vein, it will seem rather less lustrous. Of course, PMQs after a night like that was always going to be the very definition of bathos. But just because it's not all podiums and history and the leadership of the free world doesn't mean it can't be dignified. Obama won out over those repulsive imbeciles who shouted ""Terrorist!"" when his name was mentioned at McCain-Palin rallies, but small-scale victories for civility should be valued too. There was something genuinely lovely about Thursday night's Newsnight report from outside a Glenrothes polling station, where Michael Crick found volunteers from the Labour, Scottish Nationalist and Conservative parties standing wrapped up on the pavement, chatting merrily together as they conducted their exit polls. The Nats had discovered they'd actually campaigned under the ""Yes we can"" slogan in 1997, so had dug out their old placards and were giggling that Obama had stolen it from them. All seemed thrilled and invigorated by the president-elect's win, and not one attempted to do anything excruciatingly tiresome, like assert ownership of the word ""change"". If only the bigwigs for whom they were effectively standing out in the cold could take this opportunity to do the same.",Marina Hyde: Barack Obama's oratory skills extinguishes banality and witless snidery,2008-11-08T00:01:00Z,Marina Hyde,world
"The world wept with joy on Tuesday night. Probably more such tears were shed than in all history. The reason was not that a Democrat had beaten a Republican, or that the new man is young and has a gift for turning banality into rhetoric. The emotion was because Barack Obama is black. I too wept, but I did so because the massive hope loaded on to Obama seems so naive and cannot be justified. The election of this man, mesmeric since I first heard of him in Illinois four years ago and read his memoir, may symbolise the advance of a once-oppressed group of Americans, and by proxy of non-whites the world over. But embracing someone for where he comes from rather than for what he may do has been the hubris of politics throughout history. No service is done to Obama by overstating his revolution as a second coming. The most overheard media cliche is that ""America will never be the same again"". Yes it will, as it was when it last elected a Democratic president. Only if we break from the crypto-racist mindset that sees Obama as a black man first and all else far behind can the odds on a successful presidency be assessed. The election result reflected a normal pendulum swing to a conventional Democrat, as is likely in time of unpopular war and economic distress. Nothing in George Bush's wretched term of office became him like the leaving of it: he made Obama's succession inevitable. The heroes of the campaign were the primary voters, who had put up Obama rather than Hillary Clinton to win the proffered palm. Obama's 52% of the vote was not a landslide. It was the distortions of an electoral college system that served (as in the House of Commons) to turn an unexceptional four-point swing into an apparently overwhelming victory. The race spin being put on the result is quite wrong. The percentage of black people among those voting on Tuesday was up just two points, from 11 to 13%. Within the white electorate, Obama actually increased the Democratic share. The reported prominence of ""the economy"" in the minds of voters, against ""security"" in 2004, gave a natural boost to the Democratic vote. Add the unpopularity of the Iraq war, McCain's reckless choice of running mate, and Obama's brilliant campaign technique to get out his vote, and there is reason enough for the winning Democrat margin. Nor is Obama the salvationist figure assumed by many abroad. Tuesday was no black insurgency. The victory speech contained not one reference to his racial background. That ageing American icon, Jesse Jackson, hated Obama until Tuesday night. He was no son of slavery. Indeed the fascination of his memoir lies in the search by a member of an all-white family for an explanation of the colour of his skin. The new president is better seen as a classic American mix of freebooting immigrant and poor but educated mother, committed to a college education for her son. His story could be that of any president of Scots/Irish descent, rising through law school to emerge as the smoothly intellectual liberal derided by the Clintons during the campaign. Constant references to his colour obscure his real strengths and possible weaknesses. The one gain to Obama from the hysteria that has greeted his election will come if he can convert it into something politically bankable. He will - such is politics - soon be campaigning for re-election. The Republicans may go through contortions of self-examination, but their party is hardly finished. Evangelical conservatism - political and economic as well as religious - is not dead. Opponents will be prowling Congress and the airwaves, waiting to pounce on each Obama setback. Obama's popularity must be deployed early to give the conservative Washington machine, awash in interests and lobbies, the momentum it needs to ""effect change"". Bush's adoption of Keynesian remedialism was welcome, but was not enough to save the economy (and himself) from recession. Obama must no longer pander to an army of grimly implacable unions, farmers, cartels, businesses and traders demanding satisfaction. Americans have elected a leader not just for themselves but for a wide swath of peoples around the world. They cried out for Obama and America granted them their wish. But the greater the expectation of this man, the more furious will be the backlash if he proves a disappointment. There is a global detritus of American ineptitude and unpopularity to be cleared. The blundering mammoth that is America's global military projection must be curbed. Intelligence must return to foreign relations. Obama could indicate a start by closing Guantánamo Bay on day one. Will he? Dare he stop torture, accept the Geneva conventions, get tough with Israel, change policy on Russia, make peace with Iran? He has promised to get out of Iraq and fast. But he must also unleash a ferocious pragmatism as ""war creep"" envelopes Afghanistan, and stop making puerile pledges to invade Pakistan and bomb border villages. Pakistan was visited this week by a man poised to hold the leading role in the Obama presidency, General David Petraeus. It has taken Washington seven years to realise that the keys to the gates of Kabul lie in Islamabad. But that merely indicates how catastrophic it would be for Obama to continue the belligerent campaign line towards that theatre. The region cries out for the quality most lacking in Republican diplomacy, subtlety. Afghanistan could yet be to Obama what Vietnam was to the last great civil rights champion in the White House, Lyndon Johnson. All Democratic presidents eager for re-election find it easiest to buy popularity and a macho image by acting belligerently abroad. Obama has yet to indicate that he is an exception to the rule. An early test will be his response to the extraordinary sabre-rattling by the Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev. Medvedev's proposal to station missiles in the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad between Poland and Lithuania is a crude reaction to George Bush's location of defence installations in a number of former Warsaw pact countries. It is so clearly a challenge to Obama's resolve that it demands an immediate reply. The opportunity is for a classic show of firmness combined with an openness to negotiate. Kaliningrad could yet be Obama's Cuban missile crisis - the geographical parallel is eerily similar - before he has even taken office. The exhilaration of the past week has been palpable. I have lost count of the Americans who have said with relief: ""I am tired with being hated everywhere I go. Suddenly I am loved."" The moment is Rooseveltian. At a time of seeming ubiquitous misery, America not for the first time has pulled an iron from the fire. It has found a messiah. But I still prefer to see Obama not as a black man but as a talented leader of evident competence and sagacity who could use his charisma to bind people together, and his intelligence to chart a way forward. These are the specific qualities the world needs now. We should place our faith in them and not in race or colour. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com",Simon Jenkins: All the cliches about colour obscure the real challenges awaiting Obama,2008-11-07T00:01:00Z,Simon Jenkins,world
"Today the eight men and one woman of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee begin the most important meeting since the Bank of England won independence in 1997. They have to decide by how much to cut interest rates as the UK faces arguably the ugliest recession since 1945.  It has an awesome responsibility: if it errs on the side of tremulous caution by reducing rates by a mere half per cent when there is scope for more - US rates are already as low as 1% - the recession could be much worse than it needs to be. Fundamental questions will be asked about whether the MPC is taking its obligations to its fellow citizens as seriously and as widely as it should. Rates should be cut to 3% now. It has been obvious for months that monetary policy has been too tight, but it is the events of the past six weeks that have turned tightness into a dangerous straitjacket. The near-collapse of the western banking system and vicious ""deleveraging"" of overextended bank balance sheets is triggering powerful recessionary forces. The IMF last month observed that recessions induced by financial crises are much deeper and last longer than conventionally triggered economic downturns.  Events in the global real economy bear out the IMF's concerns. The price of oil has fallen to below $60 a barrel, and shipping freight rates have folded. The Baltic Dry Index, which measures those for dry cargoes, has plunged from 12,000 to less than 1,000 in a month - an unprecedented fall, suggesting a seizure in world trade movements. In the US, car sales have fallen to a 25-year low. Against this background the UK economy is reeling; transactions in the housing market have more than halved while inflationary expectations for the year ahead have dived to less than 3%.  Yet inflation now exceeds 5% - well outside the Bank's target of 2%. But as the chancellor reminded it last week, it needs to execute its task using its discretion over the timescales to the utmost, and in the light of wider government policy objectives. The open question is how much it will use that discretion. The most hawkish rate cutter is David Blanchflower, who recently said he was concerned that over the next 18 months inflation could fall to 1% - or even turn negative. He can be relied on to press for a cut of at least 1%. How many will join him? There are three other external members. The LSE's Tim Besley is not a monetary economist: he voted for a rise in rates as late as August, but in a recent speech conceded that the ""upside risks to inflation have diminished significantly"". To swing behind Blanchflower so soon would be a step too far. The other two external members, Andrew Sentence and Kate Barker, are growing increasingly alarmed by the economy's vertiginous decline. Their record suggests they back the consensus: they will not lead the argument for an aggressive cut but will back it if it is gaining ground. Which means the five Bank of England MPC members will be decisive. Spencer Dale, the newly appointed chief economist, can hardly be expected to lead. Nor, on past evidence, will either Paul Tucker or Charles Bean. The key voices will be the Bank's governor Mervyn King and his outgoing deputy, Sir John Gieve, who is responsible for the financial stability review which last week described the vortex of downward property prices and frozen lending in which the financial system is locked. He will almost certainly side with Blanchflower. So King's vote will decide matters. My hunch is he will throw his weight behind a full 1% - unprecedented for the committee. The risk of deflation is all too real, as is the political risk of being the author of a savage recession. This is a moment when gradualism will not do: the MPC must deliver.  will.hutton@observer.co.uk","Crisis watch: Governor, we need a 1% cut",2008-11-05T00:01:00Z,Will Hutton,politics
"It would be wrong to imagine that Radio 2 broadcast the Russell Brand show of October 18 unedited. This Thursday, the ever diligent Daily Mail published a section that had been cut (although some podcasts subscribers may have heard it). Brand and his guest Jonathan Ross are discussing ways to appease character actor Andrew Sachs, on whose answerphone they have just left offensive messages. ""M********e him to say sorry,"" says Ross towards the end (the asterisks are the Daily Mail's). ""Make him feel better."" (Bursts out laughing.) Brand replies, ""So sorry, Andrew Sachs, this will make up for it. Go on finish it, into the palm of my hand. Good girl for uncle daddy, good girl for uncle daddy."" (Laughs.) This might be called a Hobbesian example of humour; the 17th-century philosopher declared that laughter was one of mankind's worst attributes because it boosted self-esteem at the expense of the less fortunate, in lives that were generally nasty, brutish and short. It was a narrow view, later denied by all kinds of sunny humorists from PG Wodehouse to Ken Dodd via Arthur Askey, but the ""edgy"" comedy to which the BBC is so tremblingly devoted thrives on it.  No mention of Hobbes in the BBC's editorial guidelines, however. They are intensely practical documents, up to a point. Before the 9pm watershed, the most offensive language (cunt, motherfucker and fuck) is banned. Post-watershed, ""careful judgments"" are required and the most offensive language must be approved by ""a senior editorial figure or [for independent productions] by the commissioning editor and the relevant output controller"". In these terms, the only problematic thing about the Brand show was Ross's message to Sachs: ""He fucked your granddaughter!""  No specific editorial guideline, so far as I can tell, covers the possibility of two BBC comedians devising entertainment by broadcasting their lewd messages to an unsuspecting member of the public, other than the general words of the introduction that commit the BBC to ""the highest ethical standards"" and the need to balance the right to freedom of expression ""with the responsibility to respect privacy and protect children"".  Spare a thought for the producer and compliance officer at this point. They've cut what they see as the worst bit: the image of Brand masturbating Sachs. Perhaps the highest ethical standards and the need to respect privacy have been met. In any case, what do these phrases mean? Expressed in comparative salaries, Ross is worth 100 times more to the BBC than his producers, and precedent would suggest to them that ethical standards could in his case be applied flexibly. In 2006, he asked David Cameron about his boyhood sexuality: ""Did you or did you not have a wank thinking 'Margaret Thatcher?'"" If ever a question called for a repeat of the John Nott moment - politician throws down his mike and exits - this was it. But Cameron sat smiling, too bemused to reply.  The pattern, though not the volume, of complaints was similar to the Brand case. Only seven were received by the BBC after the broadcast, swelling to about 360 after news reports of the interview. Ofcom got a few hundred more and investigated whether there had been a breach of its code. No, was the answer. Ross had ""a well-established presenting style which is deliberately provocative"" and Cameron was a senior politician used to handling the media. Moreover, neither he nor Baroness Thatcher had protested. The Ofcom report noted that in a later BBC interview Cameron had said he would happily appear on the Ross show again - it was watched by millions of people. ""I don't agree with all the questions he asks, but my point is to go on the programme and put my point across,"" he said. What was at work here was fear of the demographic. For Cameron, that he might shut himself off from potential voters; for the BBC, that it might lose a section of its audience. The ethical standards of Britain at large, whatever they may be, didn't come into it. What mattered was offence to particular subjects, Thatcher and Cameron, and a particular audience, that for Jonathan Ross. A similar case could be made for the Brand show. The offence may have been greater and Sachs may have complained and the BBC's director general may call it ""utterly unacceptable ... a very, very serious failure of judgment"", but very few (five in all) of the people who actually listened to Russell Brand found it deplorable. A common sentiment online is that it was only two guys having a laugh - comedy demanding, as Henri Bergson said in his seminal work on laughter (though it gets no blogging mention), ""something like a momentary anaesthesia of the heart"".  Assuming Brand's audience knows what they are, can ethical standards be divided by generation? I grew up when the most daring comedy in British broadcasting was The Goon Show, which operated under the proscriptions of the BBC variety programme policy guide for writers and producers, devised in 1948 and unrevised until the 1960s. No ambiguity about the highest ethical standards here. The guide placed an ""absolute ban"" on jokes about lavatories, effeminacy in men and immorality of any kind. Suggestive references were outlawed to, quoting exactly, ""honeymoon couples, chambermaids, fig leaves, prostitution, ladies' underwear eg winter draws on, animal habits eg rabbits, commercial travellers."" There could be no personal abuse (however it was construed) towards government ministers, party leaders or MPs. All that changed with the first edition of That Was the Week That Was in October, 1962. Ted Heath said later that the programme marked the end of deference. What I remember was the enthralment of late Saturday nights, when the BBC, previously a teacher or a preacher, reached down to reflect and stimulate a growing scepticism towards previously untouchable institutions: the church, what remained of the empire, a Tory government on its last legs. None of this was easily accomplished. The then director general, Hugh Greene, faced political lobbying and barrages of viewers' protests, so much so that he grew weary of vetting each week's script in detail and eventually cancelled TW3.  A liberal history of the 20th century might describe Greene's decision as a blow against social progress and a victory, if only a temporary one, for the establishment. But there were other concerns that would find an echo in today's BBC. Donald Baverstock, controller of television, complained that while TW3's writers were so robustly attacking other people's behaviour and beliefs, they had only ""muddled standards and cheapjack values"". As Peter Cook remarked to his fellow satirist, Christopher Booker, ""Britain is in danger of sinking giggling into the sea.""  Out of the militant ironies of satire came stand-up and its associated forms of reckless performing, elevated to an importance in Britain as nowhere else as both entertainment and social criticism. Mark Thompson and other BBC voices this week talked as though comedy had always depended on its ""edginess"" for its creativity; the days of Chaplin, the Marx Brothers and Dad's Army might never have been. That view is as narrow as Hobbes's. Worse, at least for the future of the world's greatest public-funded broadcaster, is that edginess depends on the continual finding of new edges, breaking taboos and conventions that comprise ethical standards, which, however much they vary between generations, most of us hope will always be there.  The BBC can have one or the other; it has been greedy and desperate of it to try to have both.",Ian Jack: Russell Brand v Thomas Hobbes - no wonder the BBC is floundering,2008-11-01T00:01:00Z,Ian Jack,uk
"The number of ways in which Barack Obama could still lose the US presidential election is diminishing by the day - it'd take an extramarital affair with a gay terrorist, at this point, or a historically unprecedented failure of polling methods - but when you say this to die-hard liberals in American coastal cities, their faces darken. They look at you like you're bringing bad luck across their threshold; normally non-superstitious people reach to touch wooden tables. They remember the morning of November 3 2004 when they awoke - if they'd slept - to find that George Bush had squeaked through to a second term. Whatever the polls might be saying this time round, liberals harbour a nebulous dread that their fragile hopes are about to be dashed all over again.  And it could happen. But the curious and consoling truth is that even if it does, you'll probably be far less upset than you think. (I'm using ""you"", here, in recognition of the statistical likelihood that, as a Guardian reader with an interest in the US election, you're an Obama supporter. If your candidate's McCain, though, it's still relevant - even more so, given the chances of a Republican defeat next week.) On November 5 four years ago, the cover of G2 bore only the words ""Oh, God,"" in tiny letters on a dark background, which well captured the despondency in liberal Europe that morning. But for most of us, that feeling - the deep, real and personal sense of unhappiness, as opposed to the ideological, intellectual opposition to the Bush administration and its policies - didn't last. It rarely does: the overwhelming evidence from social psychology is that we're terrible at ""affective forecasting"": we chronically overestimate how sad we'll be, and for how long, in the wake of a negative event, and how happy we'll be after a positive one. The reigning monarch of affective forecasting research, the Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert, conducted a strikingly relevant study on this subject in 1996, when the Democratic governor of Texas, Ann Richards, was being challenged for the office by one George Bush. Republicans questioned prior to election day thought they'd become much happier if Bush won, while Democrats thought they'd become much less happy; one month after the result, however, their reported happiness levels were essentially the same as before. We grow swiftly numb to good new things, and explain away bad ones. ""People are wonderful rationalisers,"" Gilbert later said. ""They will rearrange their view of the world so it doesn't hurt as much."" After Bush's victory in Texas, Democrats rationalised with vigour. ""The governor of Texas really doesn't have much power,"" they told Gilbert - and, ""He wants to be president, so he's not going to do anything too dumb or crazy."" Gilbert repeated the experiment with Democrats in the 2004 election. He replicated his results, but also discovered a coda: six months after the election result, Bush opponents also remembered being much more upset than they really were. We'll never learn to be better predictors of our own happiness, it seems, because we habitually forget how wrong we were. Naturally, as in every election, there'll be exceptions. If Obama wins and his policies lift you, personally, above the poverty line, your happiness may be enduring; if you're a campaign staffer, the sting of his defeat isn't going to lift within a week. Our personal investment in this election is far greater than in many past cases. (Besides, all this talk of happiness levels among middle-class liberals is rather indulgent; there are countless reasons to back Obama that don't concern his effect on your mood.) Almost certainly, though, come November 15 or thereabouts, the identity of the next American president will simply be competing for your attention with far too many other things to have a decisive effect on your spirits. Strangely, just about the only person in the US political arena at the moment who gives a convincing impression that he wouldn't be particularly emotionally thrown, one way or the other, by Obama winning or losing, is Obama himself. (When the former Republican governor of Massachusetts, William Weld, endorsed him last week, he cited exactly this ""classy, steady calm"" as the reason.) Which is, when you think about it, bizarre - but then when did a non-bizarre person ever become president? Personally, I'm more worried about withdrawal symptoms: not the identity of the winner, but the abrupt halt, after so many months, of the race.

"So, Ross is suspended, Brand resigns, and the BBC remains stuck in yet another spell of self-doubt. I had my say on the Russell Brand/Jonathan Ross story on Tuesday, and – notwithstanding such relative trifles as the encroaching recession and the American election – I've been keeping up with the snowballing controversy ever since.  In among all the noise, there's the usual proof that when in full cry, most of the print and broadcast media only seem able to handle stories that have been hacked down to a one-line soundbite. Prior to the story's latest twist, watching and listening from last night into this morning brought plenty of proof: from the BBC's 10 o'clock News, through Newsnight, and on in turn to the Today Programme, the Ross/Brand/Sachs episode was cast as a simple matter indeed: to quote from the BBC's news website, it's all a matter of ""comments made about the actor's granddaughter"", and the fact that ""during the calls, Ross swore"" and said that Brand had had sex with her.  It's worth mentioning that all this also came with pretty horrible lines about menstruation, but in terms of what's fallen out of reports of the story, there's something a bit more important to say.  What really moved me to write about the episode (on Sunday, when it briefly made it on to BBC news bulletins, before disappearing) was not just the aforementioned stupidity – and the fact that the calls went on, and on, and on – but the fact that having surmised that they would have caused offence, the two of them made repeated quips about the idea of Sachs committing suicide, and how it might play in the headlines. With his trademark sensitivity, Brand sketched out the scenario thus: ""The main news again: Manuel Andrew Sachs hung himself today."" We should think about this – and the same words, in a similar context, coming out of the mouth of any other high-profile presenter. This was the stuff that gave what Ross and Brand did an air of school-bully nastiness, that once again pointed up how much broadcasting now seems to be founded on borderline misanthropy, and that – I think, anyway – represented the show going somewhere truly grotesque.  So, even if Brand's exit slightly damps things down, if we're going to have a right old media firestorm, can the right people start mentioning it again?",John Harris: What they did was grotesque,2008-10-29T18:40:00Z,John Harris,uk
"We are about to enter the twilight zone, that strange black hole in political time and space that appears no more than once every four years. It is known as the period of transition, and it starts a week from today, the time when the United States has not one president but two. One will be the president-elect, the other George Bush, in power for 12 more weeks in which he can do pretty much whatever he likes. Not only will he never again have to face voters, he won't even have to worry about damaging the prospects of his own party and its standard bearer (as if he has not damaged those enough already). From November 5 to January 20, he will exercise the freest, most unaccountable form of power the democratic world has to offer. How Bush might use it is a question that gained new force at the weekend, when US forces crossed the Iraqi border into Syria to kill Abu Ghadiya, a man they said had been funnelling ""foreign fighters"" allied to al-Qaida into Iraq. That American move has touched off a round of intense head-scratching around the world, as foreign ministers and analysts ask each other the time-honoured diplomatic query: what did they mean by that? To which they add the post-Nov 4 question: and what does it tell us about how Bush plans to use his final days in the White House?  You can choose from two versions. Call the first the ""no big deal"" theory. It holds that the Sunday raid was no more than standard operational procedure in the war on terror. Sure, it meant violating the sovereignty of an independent nation state, but that's not so new: there was a similar incursion into Pakistan in September. Indeed, there may be more relevant precedents. A former official in the Bush administration confirmed to me yesterday that the US has lunged into Syrian territory several times before: it's just that Damascus chose to keep quiet. In which case, the interesting question is why the Syrians went public this time.  In this ""no big deal"" version, Abu Ghadiya was simply too irresistible a high-value target to let slip away. ""They saw something they wanted to hit and they hit it,"" says one European diplomat resignedly. The most extreme version of this shoulder-shrugging account holds that the decision may not even have been taken at the political level, but in the field, by General David Petraeus. Not so implausible, since Bush in effect ceded command of the Iraq war to Petraeus a long while ago.  Nonsense, says the other school of thought. It is a massive deal to strike at a sovereign state in this way: in an earlier era, before 2001, we would have called it an act of war. Pakistan is no precedent, because in that case there was a degree of cooperation. Not now.  This was a deliberate act, calculated to send a series of messages. First, to the Syrians, reminding them who's boss in the region and strong-arming them to do more to crack down on al-Qaida.  Second, to the Europeans who have been moving towards a rapprochement with Damascus. Nicolas Sarkozy may have invited President Assad to Paris and David Miliband may have been hosting the Syrian foreign minister, Walid al-Muallem, in London this very Monday, 24 hours after the raid - but no matter. Bush gets to remind both these uppity Europeans who's in charge.  Third, the president could have been sending a message to his own administration. Perhaps this was a memo to his secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, who had dared meet Muallem at the UN just last month in a meeting that apparently she requested. If so, it would fit with the pattern of wildly mixed signals that has emanated from the administration in recent months. Two days before Rice sat down with Muallem, for instance, Bush had used his UN address to denounce Syria as a state sponsor of terror. Might Sunday's raid have been the president's attempt to reassert himself against a senior staff all but denuded of its hawks? Rumsfeld, Bolton and Wolfowitz are long gone; the more emollient Robert Gates is at defence, widely tipped to continue under a President Obama. In these last days, Dick Cheney has only himself for company.  However we are meant to read it, the attack on Syria looks a lot like a parting shot from Bush, an end-of-the-movie reminder of what this long and bloody saga has been about. A small operation, causing eight deaths, it nevertheless captures much of the Bush ethos that has ruled the globe these past eight years. It was unilateral; it trampled on state sovereignty; and it relied on force as a first, not last, resort. As a souvenir of the Bush era, it would be hard to top. But it may not be the final act. For we have not yet entered the twilight zone proper. That will come only when polls close next Tuesday. When the transition begins, all kinds of surprises are possible.  Spool back 20 years, to the dying days of the Reagan administration. In January 1989, the president officially recognised the PLO as the representatives of the Palestinian people. It was a farewell gift to Reagan's successor, George HW Bush: the old man took the flak so that the new president would not have to.  In December 1992, Bush himself proved rather less helpful to his replacement, saddling Bill Clinton with the deployment of US forces in Somalia, an episode whose humiliating conclusion badly hobbled Clinton thereafter.  Eight years ago, it was Clinton's turn. He sweated until his final hours in office trying to close a deal between Israel and the Palestinians, who seemed then to be just inches apart. The legacy was the Clinton parameters, still regarded as marking the basic contours of any future agreement for Israel-Palestine.  So what will emerge from the twilight of George W Bush? Most diplomats are bracing themselves. ""They're not going to sleep,"" says one senior British official. The optimists hope for a repeat of Reagan and Clinton, something that helps Middle East peace. It's true that Rice and Bush have been eager for a breakthrough, if only to have a presidential legacy untainted by Iraq. Perhaps Israel and the Palestinians might initial a provisional document, proof that their labours since Bush's Annapolis summit of 2007 have not been entirely fruitless.  But the bad timing that has cursed the Middle East so often has struck once again. Israel is entering an interregnum of its own, following Tzipi Livni's failure to form a coalition. It's hard to believe an interim, caretaker administration could forge a peace deal.  That leaves other options. Bush could ape Reagan and decide to speak to Hamas. More likely would be a shift in policy that helps future peacemaking efforts: he might, for instance, declare that any changes to the 1967 borders must be equal, with Palestinians compensated inch for inch for any West Bank land conceded to Israel. Or he could look further afield in the region, contradicting himself and Sunday's raid, by reaching out to Syria. Or, as some hawks fear, he could step up the tentative dialogue with Iran. A symbolic gesture would be to open a US visa section in Tehran.  Of course, Bush may be thinking of a parting gift more in keeping with the record of the last eight years. He and Cheney might decide, what the hell, we have one last chance to whack Iran - and let the new guy clear up the mess. Not likely, but possible. For in the twilight zone, anything can happen.freedland@theguardian.com",Jonathan Freedland: George Bush will soon be free to do what he wants,2008-10-29T00:01:00Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"Sell Obamas now. They are overpriced and the forward market has gone crazy. If he becomes president, the bubble will burst, I guess in the spring of next year. From the moment four years ago when I first heard of Barack Obama and read his youthful memoir, I sensed a president in the making. Like the young Nelson Mandela in South Africa, he seemed to hold the aura of incipient national leadership. His range of sympathies, his oratory, his intelligence, his energy marked him out from the run. His embodiment of the American dream was astonishing. Today the outside world, much of it with a direct and painful interest in American policy, wants Obama to win, by leads of 20% to 60%. These people have no vote. But the narrower electorate of the United States appears also to want Obama to win, albeit by a smaller margin. The world prefers him chiefly because he is black, the latter chiefly because he is not Republican. Neither reason is robust. To most non-Americans, black is still code for being apart from the American establishment. Any visitor these days to Europe, to Africa or to the Muslim world is shocked by the depth of antipathy to the US. It is beyond ideology, a visceral, often racial aversion, unrelated to any personal attachment to individual Americans or their much-envied way of life. The ugly American is reborn. Yet the same visitor is impressed by how often he is assured that an Obama presidency would ""change everything"". The reason is not that Obama is anti-war or pro-Palestinian or left or rightwing. It is that his origins render him the one thing he most vociferously denies, not an ordinary American. To this world, Obama is a supposed representative of an oppressed class, however much his speech, manner and career bespeak the opposite. He is black and his name is confirmation enough. He symbolises the end of the Wasp ascendancy. The reason why his candidacy still discomforts many Americans is the reason the world craves it, that Obama is somehow unreal. He is a meta-American. It is why there will be an awful unleashing of grief and fury if he is not elected. Yet Obama is real, not just a human being but a politician. In office he knows he must do more than make fine speeches and castigate the government of the day. He must grapple with the wreckage of a world economy whose collapse is in large part due to the mismanagement of American finance, from which as a senator he cannot altogether escape blame. He must restore credit to markets and confidence to commerce. He must bring health and welfare to a country whose poor will seem ever more ""third world"", as unemployment bites in the coming months. To millions of Americans he will seem like a messiah. There are millions whom he can only disappoint. Abroad, this leader would have to end not one war but two, and bring sanity to an American diplomacy that is chaotic in an arc of instability from eastern Europe to the Himalayas. The anticipation that he will be a harbinger of peace, friendship and economic salvation is probably greater than for any American since Roosevelt. The burden of expectation is awesome and unrealistic. The qualities of charisma and rhetoric that Obama brings to this task may be a match for it. His declared policies are not. His desire to disengage from Iraq is not appreciably different from that of the Bush administration and the Iraqi government. On the other hand, his clearly expressed wish to beef up the war in Afghanistan is reckless. Obama has approved the bombing of targets inside Pakistan (and presumably now Syria) and proposed invasion to ""secure"" that country's nuclear arsenal. He has backtracked on compromise with Iran and done nothing to suggest an end to the macho provocation of Russia. At home Obama would appear from his statements and voting records to be a conventional Democrat, essentially tax, spend and protect with tariffs. While some of this is America's business, the world economy needs a protectionist US like a bullet in the head. American markets open to world goods are vital for recovery, as is America's active participation in the easing of world trade. Obama has shown no sign of accepting this. On all these fronts there is a more alarming prospect. It is that a Democratic president, even with an overwhelmingly Democratic Congress, must beware of seeming soft or dovish or ""appeasing terror"". Such is politics that the more liberal the man, the more illiberal he can feel compelled to behave, as was the case with Bill Clinton and Tony Blair. Obama has yet to indicate a retreat from the Patriot Act or the language of George Bush's war on terror. Any modern leader parrots the language of change. Obama proclaims himself the embodiment of a revolution in American public life. Yet his record is anything but radical. He even supports the right to bear arms. Were it not for his colour, he would be a candidate running on a conventional Democratic ticket, with few policies more constructive than those of his opponent, John McCain, on how the US might now escape from its many predicaments. None of this is an argument for not voting for Obama. In present day Washington even modest competence might seem revolutionary. But democratic leadership is like Icarus. Its wings melt as soon as it flies close to the sun. Obama is flying close indeed. The instant message that an Obama victory would flash round the world is not in doubt. It would transform and refresh the US's image, exhilarating its friends everywhere. It would restore to that country the reins of global leadership so missing in the era of Republican xenophobia. It would be an utterly good thing. The next message could be very different. The skills that Obama has brought to his campaign are essentially personal and organisational, not the superhuman ones that will be required of any occupant of the White House in the immediate future. The higher the anticipation, the more crippling will be the effort needed to meet it, and the greater the fall if it is not met. The prospect of a failed Obama presidency at some time in 2009-10, whether by his doing or those of circumstance, is heartbreaking to contemplate. It would more than undo the gains secured by his election and devastate the cause he is seen as representing. The least his supporters can do is not raise the bar of expectation too high. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com","Simon Jenkins: Barack Obama stock is overpriced, and a crash could really hurt",2008-10-29T00:01:00Z,Simon Jenkins,world
"With the markets crashing once more and the last rites being pronounced over Western capitalism, the consensus is that autumn 2008 is when global economic power will have been seen to pass to Asia in general and China in particular. This is the new economic powerhouse. Its growth may slow a little while the West flounders, but it will emerge from this recession as the world's centre of economic and financial gravity. Goodbye, USA. Hello, the Chinese Communist party. It is fashionable foolishness that ignores some brute realities. The first is that Asia, except Japan, remains in essence a subcontractor to the West. Two-thirds of China's exports, for example, are made by foreign companies who essentially reprocess imports of semi-manufactured goods that are then shipped to Europe and the US. It is an economy that does not innovate - it is the great copier and counterfeiter of Western technology. This may change over the next 200 years, but not during the lifetime of most of the people reading this column. It is true there are Asian hot spots. South Korea is following Japan's lead, while India, whose foreign trade is smaller than Spain's, has promising companies and dynamic cities. Then there are Hong Kong, Singapore and Bangkok. But poverty, illiteracy, sexism and caste still dominate. The notion that mainland Asia is about to supplant the US, EU and Japan in the near future is risible.  Nor is Asia set to prop up the shattered Western economy. This is the other fashionable notion peddled until recently. Asia is now so strong and independent of the West, ran the argument, that it has 'decoupled'. It would carry on spending and producing, so partly underwriting the world economy and ameliorate the worst of the coming recession. Asia's terrified financial markets, coming to terms with their region's vulnerability, are now testimony to this profound misunderstanding. Asia is an exporter and saver, of which the best example is China. It consumes a smaller proportion of GDP than it saves, with total consumption lower than Italy's. If its exports stagnate, as they have with the rise of the renminbi against the dollar and the slowing of American spending, then its economy slows down. The rate of growth has dropped by a quarter over the last 12 months and there is every prospect of a further sizable drop over the next 12.  Nor can investment rise to fill the gap. China is saturated with ports, highways, steel mills, cement and petrochemical plants that operate at a fraction of capacity. As the realisation has grown that capacity has run far ahead of now falling demand, China's bubble economy has burst rather like our own. Its stock market has crashed and property prices are collapsing. The manufacturing heart in the Pearl River area near Hong Kong is being destroyed. Half the 2,200 factories in the shoe industry have shut, as have a third of the 3,600 toy factories.  China's ever-growing demand for raw materials is easing. Although the Chinese government says its sheltered banking system is insulated from problems in the West, last week top Chinese investment firm CITIC reported a $2bn loss from taking 'unauthorised' positions in the derivatives markets. China's banking system is a house of cards, with billions of dollars of toxic loans made at the party's request to loss-making enterprises set against tiny amounts of core capital. Some unexpected losses and the results could make the West's financial crisis look tame. The party is acutely aware of the risk, lowering interest rates and considering a big boost in infrastructure spending. Outsiders seem perplexed at the alarm that growth may subside to 7 per cent next year; would that Britain and the West will be so lucky. But bear in mind two key facts. China managed to grow throughout the Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution at nearly 5 per cent per annum. The bulk of the adult population still farms tiny plots of hopelessly unproductive land in grinding poverty. All it takes is a tiny fraction of its workers moving from doing nothing in the countryside to doing something in the towns deploying modern technology to produce growth. In these conditions, only 5 per cent growth is a crisis.  If 7 to 8 per cent growth is better, it will still not stave off a sharp increase in unemployment. Already there is an explosion of what the Chinese call 'incidents' - social unrest. As the Ministry of Labour has warned, China needs to create jobs with sky-high growth rates if it is to retain social stability.  In which case it must change. It has to consume more and become more innovative and productive. But communism stands as a roadblock.  The party is considering an amazing concession - allowing peasants to be able to buy and sell long leases on their land. This would be the biggest step towards granting property rights to 730 million rural peasants since the Revolution. The reason? The party needs them to use their land as collateral to save less and spend more. It is political dynamite, removing one of the key props of the party's support - its control of villages and land rights. But it must be considered. China is beginning the perilous path to becoming freer because the economy demands it. Then there is innovation, where its track record is abominable. China accounts for only 0.1 per cent of the world's patents that apply in Japan, the EU and the US. Economists believe the invention of general-purpose technologies, like the internal combustion engine, internet or aeroplane, that have massive general application, holds the key to growth and will accelerate in the decades ahead. Not one of this century's general-purpose technologies will be made outside the West and Japan, which have held a monopoly for 300 years. Their lead will widen rather than narrow.  The Chinese government knows it must unblock control of universities, laboratories and business if China is to change this dismal prediction and create the subtle combination of freedom to experiment and incentives in which innovation flourishes. Meanwhile, the West's financial travails are not for ever. Once they are solved, the West will be back, exploiting its capacity to innovate. Authoritarian Asian capitalism is not about to triumph over the Western liberal variant. China needs to change profoundly if it is to join the first rank of nations as their equal. Meanwhile, don't look to it - or the rest of Asia - to soften recession. The West made this mess. It must clear it up itself.",Will Hutton: Don't expect China to get the West out of this financial mess,2008-10-25T23:01:00Z,Will Hutton,world
"Glenrothes can be reached directly and quickly from Edinburgh by a series of straight dual carriageways, but on Wednesday I took the traditional and more tentative approach through the old mining settlements that followed the Fife coal seam east towards the sea. A hundred years ago these were boom towns, and until the 1960s wages kept the cooperative stores and bars of their long main streets busy with customers. Things are quieter now.  At Bowhill, I stopped at the post office and asked the two women behind the counter if we were inside the Glenrothes constituency. Neither knew. In a baker's shop, the young assistant had no idea but her older colleague thought it might be - she'd heard some talk of an election. ""I can never be bothered to vote,"" the younger woman said. ""That's terrible, you should be ashamed of yourself,"" said the older. ""Aye, I know. I'm always being told how women had to struggle to get the vote and that."" ""Not just women,"" the older said. ""The whole working class! They had to fight for it.""  There was more certain news inside the Bowhill Miners' Welfare Institute (now the Bowhill Community Learning and Development Centre), where a welcoming woman said she thought the parliamentary boundaries of Glenrothes must include Bowhill because the building was to become a polling station on November 6. Then she showed me the little museum dedicated to the memory of John Thomson, who worked at the pit here before he became Glasgow Celtic's goalkeeper, to be knocked dead in a goalmouth collision with a Rangers forward in 1931.  Thomson also played for Scotland and he was only 22 when he died. Bowhill has seen no bigger moment. A special train brought mourners to his funeral, where what a contemporary account described as ""the world's press"" had assembled ""to see sights that even the tragic history of the Fife coalfield would find hard to parallel"".  None of us knew it but at that very moment the second-largest assembly of the world's press ever seen in the locality was gathered half a mile away on a council estate in Cardenden. According to a report in the Scotsman, Mrs Sarah Brown was followed by three TV crews, seven photographers and a dozen reporters on her ""private"" visit to a few Labour-supporting families. But as there would be so little electoral point in a genuinely private visit, the prime minister's wife needed to be seen being private. The BBC and the Press Association had been exclusively informed, and then the news had leaked. All Mrs Brown would say was that she was there to support the Labour candidate, Lindsay Roy, who is the head of her husband's old school, Kirkcaldy High, and her husband's choice. The hypocrisy is too obvious, and yet one shouldn't be too fierce about it. Publicity for Mrs Brown probably benefits all eight candidates, in the sense that it tells the electorate that a byelection in which they can vote is soon to take place. At the general election in 2005, the turnout in Glenrothes was 56% and only the most stubborn optimist would predict a rise greater than 5% or 6% more next month. This week David Cameron, Charles Kennedy, James Purnell and Alex Salmond all came and went. Journalists turned out in large numbers and asked questions about George Osborne. The people of Glenrothes remained otherwise engaged. In a way, it was like watching muleteers with feathers trying to tickle a prostrate donkey back to life.  The conventional wisdom about Glenrothes goes like this. After its victory in Glasgow East, the Scottish National party thought it could wipe out Labour's 10,000-majority. Then the global crisis erupted. Small-country nationalism no longer looked so clever - Salmond will never praise Iceland again. The UK Treasury bailed out Scotland's two greatest banks and Brown emerged as the saviour of the world economy. An SNP victory is no longer secure. There's a new spring in Labour's step.  All may be broadly true; people will mention it when asked, though usually only as a kind of hearsay opinion. The world beyond might like to see Glenrothes as referendum on 11 years of Labour government, on Brown's recent heroism, on Salmond's recent difficulty, but at a hustings meeting in Glenrothes, fuel prices and antisocial behaviour got more attention and the audience was keener to talk about local concerns (the overcrowded A92 north to Dundee) than the future of financial capitalism or of Scotland as an independent state.  Greedy and inept bankers were referred to only in passing. A byelection on the brink of an unquantifiably deep but certain recession is an interesting thing. Nobody was offering to make people richer, rather they were promoting rival stunts and schemes to make some of us a little less poor than most of us will inevitably be. Only Roy for Labour and Peter Grant for the SNP stand any chance of winning; even the Tory and the Lib Dem could lose their deposits.  Grant is by far the more accomplished politician. An ex-accountant and a councillor for 16 years, he leads the SNP-Lib Dem coalition that runs Fife's regional authority, which may be his weakness because it gives his opponents a record to attack. He looks trim, speaks quickly and brims with facts, but he can be awkward and brittle under questioning. Fife's new means-tested charges for the at-home care of the sick and the disabled led to many questions from a well-organised lobby at a couple of meetings I went to, and Grant was unwise to deal with people in wheelchairs by pointing out their Trotskyist connections (""Yes,"" came the reply, ""I belong to Solidarity, but I speak as a disabled woman"").  Roy is his exact opposite, a 59-year-old headteacher with no political record at all, of whom other Labour politicians speak warmly as not being like themselves (""He's not a failed politician"", in the endorsing words of Purnell, to which an answer might be ""Not yet."") Leaflets bill him as ""a new voice for Fife"", and his pitch is that he knows the real world - he's stopped drugs at the school gate and helped boys comatose on the pavement with drink - and that he's devoted his career to ""improving the life chances of young people in Fife"". He looks and sounds very well-meaning - tousled hair, rimless glasses - and perhaps, given his shtick of not being a professional politician, it doesn't matter that he answers several questions with: ""Only Gordon knows the answer to that"" and ""You'll need to ask Peter Mandelson."" It may work. However much Fife may be changing, it would be foolish to forget the lingering loyalty to Labour bred by the coal industry. Glenrothes may be a new town and the last lump of deep-mined coal may have come out of a Fife pit 20 years ago, but Glenrothes was built to serve a mine (opened in 1957, closed five years later) and the constituency encloses several worn-looking villages where mining is a vivid familial memory; and also a port town, Methil.  After a hustings in Methil, I spoke to a few men who'd been booing Peter Grant. Had Scottish separatism no appeal for them? ""We're stronger together as country,"" one of them said. ""And they used to say that a Fife coal miner had more in common with a Cornish tin miner than he did with the local gentry.""  In few other parts of Britain would you still hear sentiments like that, or a woman in a baker's shop talking about workers fighting for the vote. If Labour wins here, it will have as much to do with the remnants of working class solidarity as anything Sarah Brown will get up to. Coal has left its stubborn imprint.","Ian Jack: The circus has come to town, but Glenrothes is otherwise engaged",2008-10-24T23:01:00Z,Ian Jack,politics
"Poor George Osborne. He is a sort of anti-Groucho Marx. One cannot help but suspect he has spent his life desperately caring to belong to clubs that don't really want him as a member.  That said, the unravelling of events this past week has been screamingly funny - if not quite A Night at the Opera, then certainly An Afternoon in Corfu. For weeks after he first leaked the story of Peter Mandelson's Greek island poison-dripping about Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor had been disporting himself with the gravity-resistant cockiness of a cartoon character who has run over the edge of a cliff, but has yet to look down. That particular illusion has come to an abrupt end, and it is now Mandelson's turn to evoke the stuff of fiction, with his twinkly-eyed refusal to condemn Osborne, after that job has been done for him, more than a little redolent of Francis Urquhart's: ""You might think that; I couldn't possibly comment."" To class Osborne as socially out of his depth in all of this might seem odd: he has led a gilded life, after all. But reading this tale of yachts and billionaires and people who need not trouble themselves with anything so vulgar as democracy, he seems a mere parvenu, whose maladroit grasp of etiquette now threatens to destroy him. (I am somehow reminded of that other supposed big hitter, Sir Alex Ferguson, being devastatingly outmanoeuvred by the tycoons John Magnier and JP McManus over the racehorse Rock of Gibraltar, a row in which the Manchester United manager was made powerfully aware of the minuscule nature of the pond in which he was the big fish.) George's family are in wallpaper. Trade, I suppose you'd call it for a laugh, and though he wouldn't be required to use the back entrance - his father is the 17th baronet - there is much to suggest he has always been more Charles Ryder than Sebastian Flyte. At the Bullingdon Club he was known as Oik, on account of having gone to St Paul's as opposed to somewhere proper like Eton or Harrow. It's only surmise, but one suspects he was rather more often the Bullingdon's raggee than the ragger, with one such ragging a neat metaphor for what has been happening to him all week. The young Osborne was held upside down by his fellow members, who banged his head on the floor each time he failed to answer correctly the question: ""What are you?"" He got it eventually. The unexpurgated answer was: ""I am a despicable cunt.""  Even in the newest Bullingdon photo to surface, Osborne looks gauche. There's something brittle and unconvincing to his swagger, tucked away downstage right in a made-up bow tie, while Nat Rothschild stares inscrutably out from the centre. Hand-tied bow tie, obviously. Much has been made of Rothschild's private nature, and he seems to have an instinctive grasp of how to turn any weaker personality traits - perhaps even catagelophobia, the fear of being ridiculed - to his advantage, cultivating an air of quiet steel, rather in the way that Charles Saatchi or Kate Moss have long traded on the intriguing power of saying nothing at all.  Osborne has betrayed himself as the opposite - a blabbermouth who picked a fight with Mandelson on ground on which he was so compromised that a regional sales rep whose Vauxhall Astra glovebox contains a copy of The Art of War could tell you that defeat was inevitable. Even more staggering, for a chap who has known Rothschild since they were at prep school, was Osborne's inability to realise that leaking details of conversations that took place while he was enjoying Rothschild's hospitality would incense his host.  Corfugate is primarily a tale of club rules broken. Not literal clubs, in most cases - though Bilderberg Group meetings have been mentioned - but the deck-shoed networks of the super-powerful, who sweetly allow politicians the illusion of being allowed to run things, and even to start the odd war, so long as they think it will bring down the price of oil. Most of the politicians ever allowed within a sniff of this world learn its mores, just as Mandelson has. They are pathetically grateful to be asked to Rupert Murdoch's annual retreats; they allow Murdoch's son-in-law Matthew Freud to buy them £34,000-worth of private jet travel, as Cameron did on this same Greek trip; and they don't do anything so vulgar as to mention in the register of members' interests that they had a meeting with Mr Murdoch while they were there. This is nothing new. John Campbell's brilliant biography of Margaret Thatcher chronicles forensically the manner in which Thatcher treated Murdoch as a powerful Reagan-like friend and ally, given free access to her, and invited several times to spend Christmas at Chequers. And yet, she never once mentioned Murdoch in her memoirs.  Whatever goes on in the rarefied air above democracy will always be politicians' dirty little secret. If it wasn't such a dirty big one, that is. The only mystery is why we seem to restrict use of the word oligarch to Russians. Oleg Deripaska, the man Osborne allegedly solicitied for a donation, is described thusly, though not Mr Murdoch, or indeed Mr Freud. Let us end this reticence. What greater credit to our meritocracy, after all, than an erstwhile popstar press officer's rise to princemaker? marina.hyde@theguardian.com",Marina Hyde: Even a Bullingdon baronet can struggle in the rarefied air above democracy,2008-10-24T23:01:00Z,Marina Hyde,politics
"Sarah Palin has provided some of the best sub-plots to the extraordinary soap opera that has been Campaign 2008 – including the latest flap about the cost of her costume and, coming soon, the release of her medical records – but there is none more intriguing than the question that could be left hanging when the saga officially concludes on November 5: what happens to Palin next? Of course, if John McCain wins she'll become the vice-president of the United States – where she would doubtless continue getting feverish media attention from now till 2012. But what if he, and therefore she, loses? On this, there are two camps. The first says Palin will slink back to Alaska and obscurity, her reputation trashed for ever by the clear evidence that she served to drag down the Republican ticket. Palin's most vicious critics go further, predicting that, once back in her home state, she will face a bitter homecoming – perhaps even impeachment proceedings following the verdict of abuse of power delivered by the independent investigation into the Troopergate affair (a verdict that was unambiguous despite Palin's Orwellian insistence that she was ""cleared"" by the investigation). The other camp, however, sees a much brighter future for Governor Palin – one focused on the Republican presidential nomination of 2012. In this view, Palin will emerge from 2008 as the frontrunner to be the party's candidate next time around.  This seems much more likely to me than a quiet exit from the public stage. After all, the jockeying for 2012 is already under way: indeed, in a signal of collective resignation to defeat on November 4, much of the conservative blogosphere is currently consumed with discussion of the 2012 race and Palin's probable place in it. In a very revealing remark to Rush Limbaugh the other day, Palin herself stoked such talk when she told him she had ""nothing to lose"" by going hard after Barack Obama – audibly calculating her own interests, separate from those of the McCain-Palin ticket.  Here are just some of the reasons why she would begin out in front. First, whatever the rest of America thinks of her, she has clearly excited the Republican base – and they are the people who vote in Republican primaries.  Second, she has powerful backers among one faction at least of the conservative intelligensia, namely the men who marked her out as McCain's VP in the first place. They don't mind her obviously limited curiosity or qualifications: they see a willing vehicle for their own ambitions, a woman who has the single quality that no politician can learn or acquire – star power. Besides, she can use the next four years to mug up on, you know, facts and things.  Third, there will be a wave of anger in a post-defeat Republican party and much of it will be directed at the ""Washington establishment"" types who sided with Barack Obama (from Colin Powell downwards) or at least criticised McCain (such as former Reagan speechwriter Peggy Noonan). Palin will be a perfect receptacle for this anger, because she is the reason so many elite conservatives have broken with McCain.  Her chief problem will be visibility. Alaska is very far away: how can she stay in people's minds, especially in the minds of the media, think-tankers and donors who she would need to start building a campaign operation? Here there are two intriguing theories. One suggests she will get her own TV show, surely on Fox News. Would that mean quitting the governorship? Normally, it would but nothing about the Palin candidacy is normal. I could see Fox tearing up the rulebook and having Palin present her own show – ""Live from Wasilla, it's Sunday morning!"" – while still in office.  Or watch to see what happens to the aged Alaska senator Ted Stevens, now under investigation for corruption. If he returns to the senate, but then has to quit soon afterwards, guess who appoints his successor. That's right, the Governor of Alaska, one Sarah Palin. She could appoint herself, sending herself to Washington to meet everyone she would need to meet.  Look, it's impossible to know exactly how she will do it. But something tells me that Sarah Palin is not ready to be a historical footnote. We have not seen the last of her, not by any means.

"A little shudder went through me every time they said it. ""President Obama's first priority will be this,"" they would begin. Or, ""The Obama administration will find that ... "" Travelling in the US last week, I lost count of the pundits, experts and Democratic insiders I heard speak with such confidence. And each time they did, I felt the urge to mutter: ""Presuming he wins."" Call it superstition, but it's one rooted in years of unhappy experience. After the British general election of 1992, or the Al Gore and John Kerry defeats of 2000 and 2004, the centre-left has surely learned that you don't count your chickens till they're hatched, squawking and deep into middle age. Which is why I won't believe an Obama presidency is possible until the morning of November 5 - and even then I'll wait till inauguration day on January 20, just to be sure.  This is not fully rational. But who said elections are rational? They call it political science, but there's all too little that's scientific about it. Otherwise you could weigh the data and draw definite conclusions about what is about to happen. But politics doesn't work like that.  Rationally, I know, every indicator points to a clear victory, if not a landslide, for Barack Obama. He is ahead in the polls, including in most of the key battleground states that will determine the winner. John McCain has now given up on Michigan, Iowa, Colorado and New Mexico - and is betting everything on taking Pennsylvania, a state even Kerry managed to hold four years ago. McCain's path through the electoral college is now narrow and perilous.  What's more, he is low on ammunition. He has just $47m to spend, while Obama raised more than three times that amount, breaking every record, last month alone. In the air war of TV advertising, McCain is coming under saturation bombardment: for every ad he runs, Obama has three, four, even eight.  Just as important, Obama is outgunning McCain on the ground. He has field offices, staffed up and teeming with volunteers, in the unlikeliest of places - small towns that cannot remember the last time anyone remembered them. Fivethirtyeight.com's Sean Quinn has been dropping in on those and on the McCain operation and describes a stunning contrast. Not only do Obama's offices outnumber McCain's by four to one, but the latter are often empty or near-empty, filled with lines of unused phones, just one or two people making calls. Quinn added up the number of McCain volunteers he had seen in six states - and it equalled the number working for Obama in the single town of Durango, Colorado.  The intangible signs are just as positive for Obama. The endorsement by Colin Powell got all the attention, but the Democrat has also won the backing of conservative newspapers, from the Houston Chronicle to the Idaho Statesman. No one pretends such endorsements swing elections, but they tell you something about the prevailing wind.  And yet I still won't say this election is over. For one thing, there is no precedent for this contest: an African-American nominee for a major party is a first. We simply don't know if the notorious Bradley effect - whereby more voters tell pollsters they plan to back black candidates than actually vote for them - will bite on November 4. Last week senior Democrats were telling me to look at the Tennessee senate race of 2006. Pre-election polls showed the African-American Democrat, Harold Ford, behind by three points - and he lost by three points. The polls got it right; ergo, the Bradley effect is dead. But this is a presidential race; it's different. A pessimistic gut instinct tells me that older, white voters across Appalachia could break for McCain, putting Ohio and West Virginia in his column. Perhaps McCain thinks the same and that's what's prompted him to bet everything on Pennsylvania. With a relentlessly negative message in this last stretch, powered by robocalls suggesting Obama pals around with ""domestic terrorists"" and by fliers photomontaging Obama's face with that of Osama bin Laden or subtly linking him to 9/11, Republicans believe they can plant just enough fear that Obama is an alien, un-American stranger - ""Not who you think he is,"" says one leaflet - to make November 4 a very long night. Meanwhile, if Democrats grow complacent, and young voters don't turn out, believing victory is already in the bag, those Republicans could be proved right. But let's say I'm too much of a worrier and that we should trust the objective data - let's dare ask the question now exercising the chatterers in Washington and beyond. What would an Obama presidency be like?  The first, depressing thought is that, if the result is close 13 days from now, Republicans will seek to challenge Obama's very legitimacy. That sounds far-fetched: after all, George W Bush only won in 2000 thanks to a single vote on the supreme court and the Democrats did not hesitate to salute him as the commander in chief. But Republicans play by different rules. Recall the treatment meted out to Bill Clinton. He won fair and square in 1992 and again in 1996, but that did not stop Republicans using every means to cast him as essentially unfit for high office - culminating in the impeachment effort of 1998. They will surely follow the same approach towards a President Obama. Indeed, they're doing it already: last week McCain campaign manager Rick Davis claimed a ""cloud of suspicion"" hangs over the election, because of Obama's links to Acorn, a grassroots group accused of trying to register bogus voters. That sounds a lot like a party preparing either to make a legal challenge to a close result - or to brand the eventual winner as illegitimate.  If Obama wins big, that will be a harder case to make. Then what? Some Democrats are growing excited at the prospect of what could be the strongest, most progressive administration since the Lyndon Johnson landslide of 1964. That may not be wholly delusional. On current projections, the Democrats are on course to win both the House and perhaps a filibuster-proof 60 seats in the Senate. Obama would have the muscle to drive through a truly radical programme.  Still, the voice of caution nags. First, the precedents are not encouraging. Both Clinton and Jimmy Carter were greeted by a fully Democratic Congress - and both got snarled up early. If the smoothness of his campaign is any guide, Obama will be a savvier operator than either of those two predecessors. But the danger is real.  Second, Obama could be constrained by a simple fact: the cupboard is bare. After years of profligacy and Bush's ballooning deficits, there is too little money around for a raft of government projects that would cost dear.  And yet, Obama has made clear that he holds the Keynesian view that a recession is precisely the time to start spending money. What's more, the banking crisis has so thoroughly discredited the laissez-faire approach to free markets, that the public mood is conducive to a shift leftward. One US historian suggests Americans only allow a dramatic expansion in government after a great rupture: FDR was preceded by the crash of 1929, LBJ by the Kennedy assassination of 1963. If that's true, then Obama might indeed prove to be, as Powell predicted, a ""transformational president"".  See, even I'm at it now - getting way ahead of myself. Of course Obama has the potential to do all kinds of great things, but we're not there yet. First, he has to win. freedland@theguardian.com","Jonathan Freedland: All sides are behaving as if Obama has it in the bag. And yet, and yet ...",2008-10-21T23:01:00Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"John McCain went into this third debate needing a ""game changer"". The trouble for him is that the game has changed. In the lead-up to the 2008 campaign, Democratic sages were lining up to warn whoever won the party's nomination that there was one lesson of past defeats they had to learn: if attacked, they had to hit back hard.  Political consultants such as Drew Westen, author of The Political Brain, warned that John Kerry, Al Gore and Michael Dukakis had all gone down because they had let their Republican opponents punch them and punch them again. Kerry had been ""Swift-boated"", refusing to dignify vicious attacks against him by responding to them - and had lost an election in the process.  Yet in this debate, Barack Obama plainly ignored that advice. McCain kept coming at him - attacking him for his relationship with an ""old washed-up terrorist"", accusing him of ""class warfare"", branding him an ""extremist"" on abortion - but Obama did not do what the conventional wisdom of campaigns past said he should. Sure, he politely tried to set the record straight, but only gently. And not once did he throw a punch back. When asked whether Sarah Palin was qualified to be president, he said it was up to the American people – and then praised her energy as a campaigner.  In the past, that would have had Republicans licking their chops, predicting that their muscular method of warfare would put away yet another meek Democrat. But not this time.  True, McCain succeeded in putting Obama on the defensive from beginning to end, forcing him constantly to deal with criticism from the Republican first and setting out his own agenda second. True, too, that McCain had his best debate performance so far (including a firm declaration that ""I am not President Bush""). And yet none of this seemed to trouble either Obama or the Democratic surrogates who spun for him straight afterwards. Emboldened by a New York Times poll that showed voters disapproving of McCain for fighting too negative a campaign, they concluded that every time McCain threw a punch, the person he hurt was himself. By contrast, the Democrats reckoned that every time Obama remained cool and unruffled, bringing the subject back to jobs or healthcare, he looked presidential - and conveyed that he cared about the voters above all.  That was the Democrats' hope, and the instant polling suggested they were right: viewers gave the debate to Obama by whopping margins, some more than 30 points.  It seems as if something has changed in American politics: these days the overtly negative attack backfires.  Rahm Emmanuel, a senior figure in the Democratic congressional leadership, couldn't get enough of McCain's efforts to discredit Obama. ""He comes over as that guy who comes out on the stoop, with his slippers still on, and starts yelling at kids.""  Why is the old Republican method of attack, attack, attack not working this year? The simple answer is the financial crisis. Suddenly, bringing up Bill Ayers sounds trivial and backward looking when Americans are concerned with jobs and bills and their own livelihoods. Obama campaign manager David Axelrod told me that when voters are consumed by ""absolute disgust"" for Washington and its failure to avoid the current economic disaster, they want to hear ideas for getting out of the mess, that and nothing else. The old attack politics no longer works. ""It would be nice if it lasts,"" Axelrod smiled.  But it only needs to last three more weeks. Because this upending of the traditional playbook is robbing McCain of the Republicans' usual weapon of choice. And he doesn't have much else left.",Jonathan Freedland: Negative campaigning hurts John McCain not Barack Obama,2008-10-16T05:07:49Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"So this is to be Brown's Falklands. Victory on Mount All-fall-down. Bonfire of the bonuses. Service in St Paul's. March-past by the Royal Troop of Derivatives Traders. Anthem to the Bankers' Brigade. Tomb of the Unknown Arbitrageur. A fortnight is clearly a long time in ideology. What fun historians will have with October 2008. Do you remember the hoary old days when they let Lehmans go bankrupt and refused to guarantee bank deposits? Where were you when a governor of the Bank of England worried about inflation and something called moral hazard? How tables turn. Socialism is now cock of the walk, capitalism mugged by reality. It is rubbish, total rubbish. Market failure has been compounded by brain failure of the discredited profession of economics, overwhelmed by journalistic wish-fulfilment and glee. The banks have not been ""nationalised"", just deluged with money. They remain pluralist and competitive institutions, with independent boards. Their workers are not civil servants. Investors retain their shares. The bonus culture will revive. The impresarios of greed have been punished, or at least a few of them. But this is not socialism in our time, just public money hurled at the face of capitalism. Guardian writers and Labour politicians have been drooling all week over what they call the ""collapse of the free market model"" of a modern global economy. They are simply wrong. All markets required regulating. It was regulation that failed last month, not the market economy. When a car is driven too fast and crashes it does not invalidate motoring. For the record, exactly the same gloating was heard after the crash of 1987. It too ""spelled the death of market economics"". As Martin Taylor, formerly of Barclays, said on the radio yesterday: ""Yes, people will return to old-fashioned banking - until they forget about what has happened."" Then the game will start all over again. Business can do without most things, but not private banks. In a seminal encounter in the early 1980s, the late Nicholas Ridley was trying to persuade a reluctant Margaret Thatcher of the virtue of privatisation. She feared she would lose control over such key industries as oil, gas and electricity. Ridley pointed out that it was far easier to command the heights of the economy by statutory regulation than by public ownership, which was encumbered by trade unions and Treasury control. Thatcher was persuaded, and the age of Oftel, Ofgas and Ofcom was born. The one that got away was the City. Hence the fiascos at BCCI, Lloyd's, Barings and Black Monday. Hence too what happened when the new building society/banks, encouraged by Thatcher and her successors to this day, went potty over homeownership. Britons were told that house-buying was the sensible way to save. Ministers would declare the ""right to homeownership"" and demand that ""every young person be helped on to the housing ladder"". Nobody cared how much this might impoverish them, or who lent the money or how, provided ministers could take credit for soaring homeownership. Nobody even cared when the negative-equity crisis burst in 1991. I carry no torch for the recklessness of the bonus culture, but it is politicians, not bankers, who should be apologising for the housing bubble. As for the bonus-drenched BBC constantly demanding that bankers ""say sorry"" for bonuses, words fail me. And its bonuses are not even earned. The toxic housing loans that were the cause of the credit crash will take time to bleed out of bank balance sheets. But bleed they will. Provided politicians can be restrained from re-hyping the British and American housing markets, the system will return to normal. Taxpayers will then get their money back, as shares are sold in tranches when the market suits. This is state ""greenmailing"", albeit on a grand scale, as was done with British oil shares in the 1980s. Governments will have performed their proper function in easing market adjustment after the bursting of a bubble. How quickly this works will depend on how far ministers show they understand banks. The toxic loan scandal began with politicians mesmerised by house-buying. MPs even expected taxpayers to pay their own mortgages for them. Mortgage splurging became so politically correct that nobody dare associate it with loan sharkery. On Monday Brown demanded that the banks in which he now has an interest stop paying dividends and bonuses, and return mortgage lending to its 2007 level. This was the surest way both to send bank shares through the floor and to revive the sub-prime chaos. Lady Vadera, the minister for economic competitiveness and small business, then added to the confusion by wanting the banks only ""to maintain the same level of marketing and availability"" of their mortgage offers. What does that mean?  Brown's purpose in aiding the banking sector should be simply to guarantee a revival of reputable borrowing, not to pick and choose. Forcing banks to eschew commercial decisions and make bad mortgage loans will drive them back to dodgy derivatives. The arrival on the scene of Vadera, author of the chaotic nationalising of Railtrack, is hardly inspiring. These people have failed the whelk-stall test too often for comfort. All this has nothing to do with the death of capitalism, rather with its resuscitation after a nasty accident. As every student of economics knows, capitalism depends on confidence, and confidence depends, in the final analysis, on power. Belatedly, governments are feeling their way to honouring this responsibility. But we should repeat the cause of the crash. It was British and American politicians who encouraged people to buy houses they could ill-afford. They duly acquired assets that would, in most cases, be realised not by them but by their children. In the rest of Europe these people would be renting their homes and saving in a safer and more liquid fashion. The first round of let's-play-banker by Brown and Vadera this week suggests that this housing madness is far from cured. We should therefore expect that its message will again be forgotten and the sickness eventually return. Though bankers are more fun to blame, it was politicians whose laxity and craving for popularity lay at the root of the present trouble. They should at least be denied any triumph for aiding its cure. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com · This article was amended on Friday October 17 2008.

"The revival of the markets has postponed the sensation that violent revolution is imminent. No longer are the sages telling us the entire system is minutes away from total collapse. The first aid, devised by Gordon Brown and hailed and emulated from the US to the eurozone, seems to have soothed the fevered brow of the moneymen. For now at least.  Still, even if the mob is not about to storm finance ministries from Paris to Washington, few doubt that we are witnessing an epochal event, living through one of those moments on which history pivots. Newsweek International editor Fareed Zakaria writes that he had always wanted to experience the kind of event ""one reads about in books. Well, this is it"". In the Financial Times, Philip Stephens says that two centuries of US and European domination are now at an end, as the western economic model is humbled. Robert Peston announces the end of the Thatcherite age. On these pages yesterday Steve Bell consigned the lady herself to the dustbin of history.  Of course, these verdicts might turn out to be overblown. Some are counselling that the great turmoil of 2008 will turn out to be less tempestuous than advertised. For one thing, the Brownian notion of part-nationalising the banks could work, turning what would have been a major depression into a mere, if harsh, recession. In that case, the political impact would surely be muted. The ground was laid for Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal not simply by the Wall Street Crash of 1929, but the lines of the destitute queueing for a bowl of soup. In this view, a convulsion to the financial system will not, by itself, be enough to usher in a new political era; not unless the tremors shake the real-world economy and society along with it.  Still, let's accept that the events of the past few week are indeed epochal. Most are quite clear on what has ended: the era of let-it-rip, unfettered market capitalism has surely drawn to a close. As Andrew Simms, policy director of the New Economics Foundation, puts it: ""This is to finance-driven capitalism what 1989 was to Soviet communism."" In both cases, too much unaccountable power had concentrated in too few hands, with too little transparency, as those in charge lived in a financial fantasy land, playing with numbers wholly detached from productive economic activity. If that's now all over, what's coming next? The first shift might be a radically different approach to public spending. Now that they have seen their governments spend eye-popping sums of money to get out of a crisis, won't voters demand similar largesse to solve other pressing problems? For decades, politicians have told constituents that there simply isn't the cash to pay for, say, the £3bn that would be needed to halve child poverty by 2010, or the annual £8bn it would take to get 20% of our energy from renewable sources. Now, though, those look like paltry sums next to the £37bn the government plans to inject into Britain's ailing banks. Saving post office branches in deprived areas at a cost of £150m? Small change! In this way, the rhetoric of public discussion on spending could change drastically, with voters' patience for arguments of prudence evaporated. ""If you could find the money to clear up the mess left by a few greedy fat cats,"" voters will say, ""then you can find the money to fund this bus service/save this village school/renationalise the railways."" Or it could go the other way. The politicians may find that, though the public mood becomes more conducive to active, high-spending government, they simply lack the means to pay for any of it. They will have already borrowed to the hilt for the banks bail-out and will have nothing left, resources further depleted by the coming recession. In this atmosphere of fiscal tightness, ministers could skirt round vexed ideological terrain and simply plead poverty. There would be no need for an embarrassing U-turn on, say, the principle of ID cards: Jacqui Smith could say she still thinks they are a good idea but, at an estimated £6bn or more, we simply cannot afford them. Ditto Trident renewal: Brown could insist he maintains his faith in nukes but say that at, £20bn, revamped weaponry is a luxury Britain cannot afford.  Elsewhere, the public failure of unregulated free markets has been so visible it could lead to a demand that financial institutions now operate by criteria other than the narrow, selfish measure of their own bottom line, taking into account the wider needs of society as a whole. If that sounds like woolly, hopelessly utopian thinking, consider this. RBS is set to be majority-owned by you and me, the taxpayer. HBOS is not far off. Now what will those banks do when faced with people falling behind on their mortgage payments? In the past they would have ordered repossession, which made sense in terms of pure profit and loss. But now there will be other factors to consider, because these banks will no longer work solely for dividend-hungry shareholders but for the taxpayer. Every family that has endured a repossession costs the public purse, through rehousing, most obviously, but in myriad and less visible ways - right down to the burden that falls on the NHS as it repairs the mental and emotional damage inflicted by forced eviction.  Now since RBS's imminent owners - us - have to pay those bills as well, we will surely demand that the bank slow down rather than move in for the kill, perhaps through restructuring the debt of that struggling homeowner or at least running a ""full-impact assessment"" of repossession. The government already promises to impose demands on the banks they part-own, including gentler treatment of small businesses. But once taxpayers realise their new-found power, there is no reason to assume it will be confined to just those areas. We could insist the banks we partly own behave in an entirely new way.  No less clear a lesson of 2008 is that we have to live much more closely within our means. That must apply to individuals, reining in the credit- card habits of the past decade, and to governments who have perpetuated what Zakaria calls ""a great fraud"", spending ever more without raising taxes. The result in the US is a national debt of $10.2 trillion.  That act of denial has to end now. It will mean either cutting back on spending or increasing taxes, or both. But that needn't be as gloomy as it sounds. Revenues could rise by taxing those things we want to see the back of anyway: starting with a windfall tax on the energy companies, penalising them for their reliance on fossil fuels. As for spending, we could shed the waste - ID cards and Trident renewal - and spend what we have on a massive effort to green our society, from home to factory. That would obey classic New Deal logic, providing jobs, helping those in fuel poverty, tackling climate change and keeping the economy ticking over - all at the same time. Simms at the NEF thinks we may end up going further, moving to shorter working weeks as people accept that they will earn less and consume less - but will have more time for family, friends and life. That seems like a radical fantasy now, but who knows? For when old dogmas die, there is room for all kinds of new thinking. The financial tsunami has given us this if nothing else - a chance to start again. freedland@theguardian.com",Jonathan Freedland: Banks working for us - crisis could prove a fresh start,2008-10-14T23:01:00Z,Jonathan Freedland,politics
"It seems that I, along with all the females in the country, should be thanking Jade Goody. But first maybe the British public should ask themselves - how real is our interest in her plight? Or is this just more 'grief porn' for the masses? Not so long ago, Goody was the ultimate Celebrity Untouchable, only useful to be occasionally ridiculed in photo spreads about bad shoes or sweat patches, or apologise yet again for bullying Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty in the Big Brother house. A year or so on, Goody was still all but excommunicated from the world of celebrity; the standard reaction to her name would be a mewl of disgust.  Odd then, even rather distasteful, that since the announcement of her aggressive cervical cancer, we suddenly can't get enough of her. Even odder, perhaps, that some appear to be blaming Goody for this.  What does it say about British society that we have such a powerful mawkish streak? Nor does it take the death of an uber-icon such as Princess Diana to inspire it. Never mind the Queen of Hearts - this runs all the way through the celebrity alphabet from A list through to Z. Moreover, say what you like about the 'over-sentimental' Americans, but even they are more temperate in such matters. When Paul Newman died, there was certainly interest and grief in the US, but there wasn't the kind of eye-dabbing, nose-blowing weepathon of the kind you'd expect over here. It has long struck me that not only are the British ambulance chasers, but that we're not averse to waiting patiently at the depot for the ambulance to leave. At the risk of being facetious, there is almost an element of: 'Ooh, someone's really poorly; let's make a day of it.' Indeed, one wonders how former EastEnders Wendy Richards must be feeling about the media coverage of the return and spread of her cancer? Richards reacted in a no-nonsense manner by saying she was furious about its return and bringing forward her wedding to last Friday. One hopes the event was not marred by the grisly sense of media countdown that now dogs 'Battling' Wendy's every move. It has been suggested to me that celebrities such as Goody and Richards can often seem more real than the real people around you and this goes some way to explaining the exaggerated public reaction to their health problems. However, it also shames those who criticised Goody for going too public with her plight, to the point of giving paid interviews to publications such as OK! magazine. Are we seeing here the flipside to the British appetite for grief-porn? As in: it's all very well for the public to circle like vultures, and for the media to use it to shift product, but somehow déclassé for Goody to be proactive? Its almost as if she should eschew such tacky behaviour and instead lie in state, awaiting her fate, like some 'Bermondsey Evita', all the more worshipped because she is quiet and still. Phooey to that, Goody evidently thought, and we should be grateful she did.  The squeamish (and, yes, I do mean men) should maybe look away now for I must speak of 'down there'. Which brings me to why females should be thankful to Jade. How many of us sheepishly made a long overdue appointment for a smear test when we heard about what had happened to Goody? I did, scuttling to the GP the first chance I got. By the same token, how many people immediately stopped umming and aahing about the new cervical cancer vaccination for young girls and realised it was a great idea? This is what Jade has achieved with her horrible health luck, 'too public stance' and supposedly tacky OK! interviews - a heightened awareness of cervical cancer that has probably been more powerful than a 100 NHS campaigns combined. Similarly, Richards has underlined the need for vigilance even after you've got the all-clear. Indeed, if we feel the need to criticise, we should maybe take a look at that element of ourselves that likes to gawp. Not that this necessarily means we should stop. In a roundabout way, the part of us that reacts to Jade's story is probably the same part that sends money to charity appeals.  In a nutshell, there is nothing bad, and plenty good, about the ability to feel empathy for a complete stranger - so long as we're aware that what is happening isn't an old soap plotline of Wendy's or a PR stunt of Jade's. So long as, just like what's happening to them, our sympathy is real. Suffering from BSF? Don't worry - you're not alone As if the credit crunch weren't tough enough, our house seems to have come down with Boxed-Set Fatigue (BSF). For the benefit of the uninitiated, BSF is what happens when you can't really afford to go out anymore, so you and your other half stay in and work your way through sundry boxed sets of 'comedy and popular drama', until suddenly, one night, sprawled in bed, bickering and slapping each other's hands away from the remote control, your bodies half-submerged in discarded discs, you realise you just can't take it anymore.  With financial meltdown all around, you might think this is small beer, but ask any long-term couple - lack of synergy in such an area can be corrosive. I still bear the psychological scars of realising that The Sopranos boxed set I believed we were enjoying together had, in fact, been wolfed down secretly by my partner, resulting in him having to fake watching the series with me. Ditto, Curb Your Enthusiasm, where a bit more curbing and a lot less enthusiasm would have been nice. But those were our glory days, when we actually managed to finish the damn things.  Where BSF is concerned, it turns out that men are weak, leastways not as strong as woman. A certain someone keeps collapsing into unconsciousness during, of all things, The Wire. Currently, it's taking us an average of three nights an episode. Sometimes he refuses to watch it at all and I'm forced to behave like some DVD version of sex starved Yootha Joyce in George and Mildred: 'Oh come on, just one episode!'  On the bright side, maybe it's a zeitgeist thing, one of the hidden costs of the credit crunch: skint couples imploding under the strain of staying in to save money and ending up watching too many boxed sets together. In such circumstances, is it any wonder one ends up with compatibility buckling, differences emerging? All over the country, couples are locked in their own poignant Neil-Babs moment: 'You don't watch ""previously unseen footage"" with me anymore.'  Alternatively, those couples afflicted with BSF could stop being so pathetic: defy the credit crunch, ditch the DVDs, and go out - to laugh, talk, who knows, perhaps even rediscover each other? But let's hope it won't come to that. I've only got eyes for one tiger and it's not the one with whiskers How selfless is Vladimir Putin in continuing to share his midlife crisis with us? The former Russian president is fast becoming the Charles Dance of international politics - forever inappropriately disrobing and looking 'virile' out of context. I may have to get a special corkboard to keep up with my ever-increasing stockpile of Vlad 'I've still got it!' Putin photos. While some might argue that the infamous topless hunting shots of Putin more than hit the spot, Vlad, a recent birthday boy, just keeps on giving. There was that fearless posing with one of his presents, a Siberian tiger cub. 'She eats meat,' Vlad explained. Intriguing. There is also a brand new DVD, entitled Let's Learn Judo With Vladimir Putin, in which he struts around in white judo jammies, throwing opponents to the floor and opining: 'The practice of struggle permits compromises and concessions. But they are possible only if they are on the road to victory.' Quite. I, for one, don't mind admitting it took many milliseconds to tear my eyes away from the sheer buffness of the man whose decisions regarding Chechnya and Georgia made Robert Mugabe fleetingly resemble the world's second least reasonable man. More seriously, while Putin displays all the signs of being as crazy as a cut snake, he makes our lot look like a sorry shower. What do our ex-premiers ever do with their post-power years except sit on vague-sounding international committees, or stick their snouts in the lecture circuit trough? By contrast, Putin is hurling about men half his age and rambling away gnomically, like Eric Cantona playing Colonel Kurtz in some judo-themed Apocalypse Now. You've got to admit he's different; one could even say special. But is this enough for Vlad? Putin will surely need another challenge and may disappear to go native in some dense jungle, with a knife between his teeth and a poem in his soul. We must enjoy him while we still can. · This article was amended on October 26 2008. Vladimir Putin is the former President and current Prime Minister of Russia, not the 'former premier' as we said in the article above. This has been corrected.

"Leaving aside the constraints of the national curriculum, there seems no reason why our teachers should not double as spies. This dual function has been quite a tradition in British education, at undergraduate level at least. Admittedly, Cambridge dons who recruited, among others, some members of the Apostles, did not have to weigh up the impact of their work on literacy hour. But if the demands of espionage now leave teachers with less time for spelling, well, as Ed Balls demonstrates in his department's new spying manual, 'Learning Together to be Safe', this is no time for pedantry. 'Instead of rappers glamourising (sic) gun crime,' writes the chief of Department for Children, Schools and Families Centre, quoting an insightful young person from whom we can all learn, 'it is extremists glamourising (sic) terrorism'. So the case for surveillance is undeniable. With at least one British primary school pupil having apparently expressed admiration for the '7/7 martyrs', all schoolteachers should consider their own response in similar circumstances. Official advice is to invite the child to 'learn about emotional needs and consequences of actions'. Then, at the same time that they consider 'the need for involvement of external partners' (ie, calling the police), teachers might want to 'sensitively monitor continuing behaviours', presumably without alerting the child in question that he or she is being sensitively monitored. What Mr Balls's practical-sounding 'toolkit' neglects to mention is where teachers are meant to acquire the relevant tradecraft. Radicalisation is unlikely to be taking place within the school. Can straightforward teacher training be adequate preparation for the sort of extensive, yet clandestine operations that are indicated by 'Learning Together to be Safe'? Fortunately, where the basics of surveillance and covert communication are concerned, a lot can be learned from the novels of John le Carré. When spying on a child Islamist it makes good sense, for example, for teachers not to hang around too obviously outside the house where indoctrination is occurring, like the useless pair of spooks in le Carré's admirable new novel, A Most Wanted Man Should 'Learning Together to be Safe' prompt a heightened counter-espionage response from young extremists, the behaviour of Magnus Pym in le Carré's A Perfect Spy is also worth a look, bearing in mind that Pym's precautions did not have to be fitted around weighing the obese, teaching happiness and instilling a sense of Britishness. Here we find him showing teachers how to establish that their SATs and government pamphlets have not been tampered with: 'Regaining his room he checked the papers on his desk. Stapler to handle of teacup. Book matches to pencil. Burnbox aligned to desk leg ...' At the same time, the story of charming, treacherous Pym serves as a warning, to Balls and his spies alike, that out of all the thousands of teachers in this country some are bound to be more loyal than others. Whom should they trust? Some benign-looking colleagues might simply be better at concealing their sympathies than the notional supply teacher whose case-study features in Balls's toolkit. Not all violent extremists will be silly enough to leave hate literature, advocating martyrdom, in the school library ('seek advice on the content via the police'). Sidique Khan, for example, did not arouse any suspicion between 2001 and 2004 when he worked as a £17,000-a-year 'learning mentor' at Hillside primary school in Leeds. On the contrary: the former headmistress of that school, Sarah Balfour, said: 'Sidique was a real asset to the school and always showed 100 per cent commitment.' So had anything like the toolkit existed at that time, there seems no reason to suppose that Khan - 'Sid', as he was affectionately known - would not have gone on to become the ringleader of the 7/7 terrorists who murdered 52 people in London in 2005, six of them killed by his own suicide bomb near Edgware Road tube station. Khan was 30, married and a father when he slaughtered fellow citizens: perhaps much younger, less sophisticated extremists will be easier to identify? Any clues? The toolkit is unable to be very specific. 'The key conclusion from available evidence is that there is no single profile of a person likely to become involved in extremism,' it vouchsafes. None the less, teachers are invited to note that unemployment is one of several factors that might 'translate to a generalised rejection of civic life'. That these particular unemployed people will not be at school any more must not, of course, deter teachers from looking out for pupils who might feel this way if and when they do find themselves without work. The price of freedom, and all that. And did not the DG of the security services recently mention children, 'as young as 15 or 16 implicated in terrorist-related activity'? Sooner or later one of these junior extremists is sure to betray him or herself at circle time. After which it is simply a question of expert surveillance. No doubt teachers can feel confident that, in the event of a violent extremist being identified somewhere in or around a school, the individual in question will be more scrupulously monitored than were two of the 7/7 bombers, after the police observed their contacts with the gang plotting to blow up fertiliser bombs. And then focused their attention elsewhere, since limited resources did not allow them to monitor every extremist who might be avoiding surveillance, attending militaristic training camps and discussing jihad on the telephone. Maybe it's just as well, in these straitened circumstances, that teachers are so unlikely to identify, or discourage (through enlightened class debate), any of the embryonic terrorists who might now be in their classrooms. Individual extremists are unlikely, according to psychologists who have studied suicide bombers, to reveal themselves as notably strange or unbalanced. A contemporary remembered the teenaged Sidique Khan as 'friends with the in crowd'. Moreover, as described by former members of extreme, Islamist organisations, radicalisation usually happens once teenagers have left school, when they join small groups at college, in community centres, or around mosques, often replacing their own families' religious practices and, even, the legacy of their anti-bullying projects, with a new creed that, as Shiraz Maher has said, 'provides ""an ideological infrastructure cheering them on""'. Still, even if violent extremism is likely to elude them, there are plenty of other challenges for Britain's infinitely resourceful teachers. If their job description can be extended, as the toolkit proposes, to encompass espionage, at the same time that they instil in children the importance of 'mutual respect and understanding', the criminality of violence, and primacy of 'staying safe', Balls's task force could surely be persuaded to stamp out knife crime and build what he calls 'more cohesive and resilient communities', perhaps by dismantling faith schools? And once the teachers have created this heaven on earth, they can teach us all to spell.",Catherine Bennett: So teachers must be spies - now that really is a bit extreme,2008-10-11T23:01:00Z,Catherine Bennett,uk
"Let's make one thing clear. Writing about music and its attendant subcultures is a noble, enriching, high-minded pursuit, which has played a surprisingly large role in the last 40-odd years of British pop-cultural history. I have bookshelves crammed with music writing, and I rather miss the days when I would cart home at least three music weeklies from the newsagent and pore over what they had to say. Contrary to what that Elvis Costello famously said, it amounts to much more than ""dancing about architecture"", and as someone who has endlessly benefited from the adoration of writers and critics, he should know. There is one exception to all this, however: the dryly-written, over-analytical, ill-informed, pseudo-controversialist output of a certain kind of academic. You know the type: they fail to understand that seminar rooms and lecture halls are really no place to be talking about a music founded on impulse and the thrill of the moment, write long and rambling papers about anything from acid house music to the mod revival of 1979, and get most of it hopelessly, horribly wrong. And here comes yet another example. The Cambridge University historian David Fowler is the author of a new book entitled Youth Culture in Modern Britain c1920-1970. As well as pre-war swingers and groovers, student revolutionaries and mods and rockers, it also focuses on the Beatles – who, says Fowler, were ""young capitalists, who, far from developing a youth culture, were exploiting youth culture by promoting fan worship, mindless screaming, and nothing more than a passive teenage consumer."" Ooh! Iconoclastic, or what?  And wrong, frankly. What Fowler says rather suggests a carefully formulated plan to bleed the pockets of the nation's teenage girls via cutesy pop songs, moptop hairdos and regular TV appearances. Some people did do exactly that – Herman's Hermits spring to mind – but if the Beatles were indeed focused solely on ""mindless screaming"" and ""a passive teenage consumer"", why the endless leaps in artistic imagination that led from A Hard Day's Night to Rubber Soul, and on in turn to Sgt Pepper and The White Album? If they were the ""young capitalists"" Fowler alleges, why was their business acumen – and, indeed, that of their manager Brian Epstein – so legendarily hopeless, and their response to all those screaming crowds so ambivalent (or, in the cases of John Lennon and George Harrison, downright miserable)? To top it all, he claims that ""whether the Beatles had a major influence on British youth culture during the 1960s is questionable"" and that ""they were family entertainment rather than at the cutting-edge of youth culture"", points so completely wrong-headed that they barely merit a response.  The truth is, having read through around 50 pages of his book, all this is a matter of cheap points, non-sequiturs and overexcited assumption. He makes much the same mistake as most pop academics: trying to insert mercurial, irrational musicians and the art they create into the kind of fixed categories that do them and their impact no justice at all. To take his most remarkable point head-on, the Beatles were neither capitalists nor left-aligned revolutionaries: just musicians, driven by inexplicable imperatives to do their thing – which, as it turned out, both crystallised and encouraged the irreverent, communitarian, anti-establishment attitudes of the generations born during and after the second world war, and thus created a moment by which every succeeding pop-cultural development has been judged (and rightly so).  If you want to read an incisive explanation of all this, go straight to the late Ian Macdonald's Beatles book Revolution In The Head. To understand how it all played out on the ground, have a look for the oral 1960s history Days In The Life, edited by Jonathon Green. Even better, just put on one of the relevant records, and leave the ever-increasing mountain of cult-studs' blether to gather the dust it deserves.","John Harris: The Beatles were musicians, not capitalists",2008-10-09T12:00:00Z,John Harris,uk
"Those that were asking for a decisive intervention to halt a financial pandemic certainly got it yesterday. It was almost too big for shell-shocked markets to assimilate. Their reaction, in part driven by the mounting sense that this crisis is now international and out of control, was profoundly disappointing.  Yet Britain has produced a well thought-through, bold and comprehensive plan to put its financial system on a sounder footing - well ahead of any other government. Messrs Brown and Darling for once deserve some congratulation. There is every chance they will find themselves lionised at the IMF meetings in Washington this week as the one government that has finally risen to the occasion. Big money is on the table. I estimated the cost of the package of measures that I recommended in the Crisis Watch column on these pages yesterday as between £350bn and £400bn, including up to £50bn of new capital for the banks - which I thought at the limits of the possible. The overall price tag on the actual measures is £500bn.  The proposed recapitalisation of the eight banks is vital - and it is conspicuous that it goes well beyond what any other government has contemplated. It will leave British banks as the most solidly capitalised in the world, even if it is a confidence shaker that the deficit in their capital was allowed to grow so big. The obvious concern is that without a ""bad bank"" to buy their toxic loans - the one omission from the package and importantly used by Sweden in its 1992 rescue plan, on which this is closely modelled - taxpayers' money will be immediately used to fund write-offs, so sending the banks back to square one. And the means of getting capital into the banks - preferred equity - has very little capacity to offer a compensating upside gain for the taxpayer because preferred equity share prices are more or less fixed, unless, like Warren Buffett's investment in Goldman Sachs, the government has warrants. A ""bad bank"" has the merit of both removing the risk of further write-downs against the replenished capital, and also allowing the toxic debt to be partly or even fully recovered in better times - saving the taxpayer cash. On the other hand if the government succeeds in preventing a bank going bankrupt and the disastrous domino effects that would create, while its other interventions work the amount of toxic debt might stay limited.  The most eye-catching, eye-popping element of all is the up to £250bn of government guarantees for lending in the interbank market. This is targeted at what has emerged as the heartland of the problem - the de facto bank run, in which the big banks had completely lost confidence and stopped lending to each other. The guarantee is a double whammy. It will allow them to lend to one another again without fear, and to use guaranteed loans to finance maturing asset-backed securities - and on a huge scale. Barclays can now comfortably refinance the £28bn of its securities falling due next year; RBS its £18bn.  Given all this - along with the doubling in size of the Bank of England's special liquidity scheme and the coordinated cut in interest rates by Britain, the US and the EU - it is serious that the FTSE 100 closed the day more than 200 points down. One problem is that it will take time for the guarantee to open the interbank market, where the London interbank offered rate only eased a tiny fraction yesterday. Another is that the British action has exposed the inadequacy of what is proposed elsewhere - and thus the gigantic scale of both the problem and what has to be done by other governments, confirmed by the sombre pronouncements by the IMF and chair of the US Federal Reserve.  The American decision not to support Lehman Brothers is now turning out to be the fulcrum on which the crisis has turned. It is not just that Lehman had $110bn of senior bonds that are now virtually valueless; it had written an estimated additional $440bn credit default swaps on top which it cannot honour - a large part of which will come due at the end of this week. Wall Street is transfixed, as are the Asian markets. Nobody knows where these losses will end up. It has suddenly become obvious that the Paulson plan cannot simultaneously handle this together with the fallout of the sub-prime crisis. And in addition there is the impossible challenge of financing trillions of dollars of asset-backed securities which are maturing when the world's interbank markets are shut. Britain may have invented a way to allow its banks to do this, but banks in other countries need the same help, along with the same chance to recapitalise themselves. This will dominate the discussions at the IMF/World Bank annual meetings this weekend. Britain has bitten the bullet and partially nationalised its banking system. Other countries, notably the Americans, need to follow our lead - and to do so fast. Incredibly, it may have fallen to Gordon Brown to show the world how to avert a slump. • Will Hutton is executive vice-chair of the Work Foundation  will.hutton@observer.co.uk",Brown and Darling have bitten the bullet - and set the world an example,2008-10-08T23:01:00Z,Will Hutton,politics
"Financial panics are terrifying. Suddenly a latent primeval instinct to run for the hills, to sell, to hoard cash seizes everyone. Strong and weak banks alike are swept up in the rush to hold cash. To bring the panic to an end there has to be some seismic event to make everyone realise that, while as individuals we might succumb to the whirlwind, collectively we can confront the threat and manage it.  Yesterday the chief executive of a leading FTSE company told me that the collapse in bank share prices, particularly of HBOS and RBS, was reflecting the reality that Britain was on the edge of a bank run - a withdrawal of deposits that unless aggressively and decisively countered could generate a domino effect that would leave Britain without a single functioning deposit-taking or credit-supplying institution. I expect that same message was being delivered to a crisis meeting at Downing Street last night. Alistair Darling promised to make a statement before markets open this morning. If the government has recognised the gravity and urgency of the situation, he will outline a comprehensive package. I would have urged five key moves: 1. The government must announce the injection of up to £50bn in taxpayer money into Lloyds-TSB, HBOS, RBS and Barclays as preferred equity and be ready to do the same for HSBC if required. It will subscribe another round of capital if necessary, doing whatever is required to ensure the solvency of British banks. The terms should be generous. The aim is not to hobble the banks but to enable them to resume lending. 2. It should establish a fund of up to £100bn, or ""bad bank"", modelled on the US Paulson plan, that will acquire so-called toxic debt from distressed British based lending institutions. It will hold this debt for up to 20 years, aiming to sell it in a better economic climate for no loss - or even a profit. It should also say that it has opened negotiations for this fund to be combined with a pan-EU fund and IMF fund to buy toxic debt from the world's financial institutions.  The combination of moves 1 and 2 will give the banks the balance sheet strength to resume lending. Iceland - a weak link in the international chain - must be included in an IMF package. 3. The Bank of England must step up its activity in the inter-bank markets. It should establish a special purpose company in tandem with the ""bad bank"" directly to purchase unsecured commercial paper from the banks. Any losses will be held by the ""bad bank"".  4. EU governments should require the EU Commission to suspend its rules on state aid that prevent government insurance guarantees for the value of new issues of residential mortgage backed securities. This will encourage foreign investors in particular to buy these securities, a vital source of mortgage finance, whose disappearance has caused the mortgage famine. We must steady a property market threatening to implode in a downward vortex that could induce a sequel to the financial crisis. 5. The Bank of England must cut interest rates by at least 1% to deliver a decisive signal that it recognises that the risk of debt deflation, disinflation and major recession outweigh short-term concerns about inflation. There is much more to be done - reconfiguring the financial system, changing the dynamics of British capitalism and constructing functioning regulation. That is for later columns. Today we must simply avoid financial calamity. • Will Hutton and Larry Elliott will give their verdict on the latest developments in the financial crisis on these pages from Tuesday to Friday for the coming weeks  will.hutton@observer.co.uk",Five crucial moves,2008-10-07T23:01:00Z,Will Hutton,politics
"Is it time to stash the tinned soup and bottled water in the cellar, along with a shortwave radio and a dagger, just in case? Just where, exactly, is this financial crisis going to end - with the collapse of the entire banking system, plunging London into a Mad Max purgatory of burnt-out cars and howling dogs, as survivors of the disaster stab each other for a last hunk of bread?  You won't hear Robert Peston predicting that on the Today programme. But when the air is filled with talk of meltdowns and crashes, when 40% is wiped off the value of two of Britain's largest banking groups in a single day, as it was yesterday, you find yourself wondering. Not least because no one can offer certain reassurance of anything. In the past few weeks, actions once considered unimaginable have happened. There was a time when to suggest that a British government would nationalise not one but two high-street banks would have had you certified as a hopeless leftist fantasist. Now public ownership has become the norm, with the City itself and a former Conservative chancellor demanding more of it and fast.  ""Everyone knows they're going to have to do it,"" Ken Clarke said yesterday of the proposed recapitalisation plan, expected to be part of the government package announced this morning and which would see the taxpayer buy a stake in the Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and Lloyds TSB: ""Get on with it."" Now nothing seems impossible. Those rapidly emptying out their accounts are doing so because they can imagine the banks crashing to the ground, taking their life-savings with them. I spoke with one financial adviser whose phone has grown hot with clients wondering whether they should move their money to Ireland. ""But what if the Irish banks collapse?"" he tells them. ""Would Ireland really have enough money to reimburse all those depositors?"" Once it seemed ridiculous to suggest a national banking system going bust. Now it's possible that an entire country could go bankrupt: look at Iceland, forced yesterday to phone Moscow begging for a loan. It's enough to make you want to shove your cash in a piggy bank, hide it under the mattress - then pull the duvet over your head and hope it all goes away.  The instinctive response to such a situation - not that anyone under 80 has lived through anything comparable - is to look for someone to fix it. And that someone means the government. And yet, up till last night at least, the politicians had been floundering. Alistair Darling addressed the House of Commons on Monday in order to calm the markets and reassure the nation. Yet, as yesterday's Guardian front-page graphic cruelly illustrated, his words had precisely the opposite effect. In the 11 minutes it took him to promise that he would do ""whatever it takes"" to keep the financial ship afloat, the markets plunged. The day saw the biggest loss on the FTSE 100 since 1987.  Ah, say the experts, but that was only because Darling had failed to say what the money men needed to hear. He came up with no specifics and, what's more is deemed weak, still in Gordon Brown's shadow and too uninspiring a communicator to persuade the neurotic men of the markets of anything.  But there is a flaw in this conventional wisdom. Look at what happened across the Atlantic. There Hank Paulson, admired as a muscular treasury secretary, fully the master of his brief, took the most decisive action possible. No half-measures, but a $700bn bail-out aimed at mopping up the bad debts of every lender in the land. This was not the pale, pink socialism of Northern Rock or Bradford & Bingley: this was red-blooded Bolshevism, seizing the commanding heights of the financial system. You gotta love the Americans: if they do something, they do it big. Sure, it fell at the first hurdle, defeated in the House of Representatives, but it passed eventually. And yet, did it pacify the markets? Did it persuade them that this problem was at last under control, thereby replenishing the supply of the only commodity that has actually run out during this crisis - given that there is no sudden shortage of oil or food - namely, confidence? It did not. The Dow Jones responded to the passage of the US rescue plan not by sighing with relief and declaring the trouble nearly over, but by shrugging its shoulders - and falling. That is a grim warning to Brown and Darling: whatever drastic action comes this morning might not end the turmoil. It's as if nothing the politicians can do is good enough. If they plug one hole in the dyke, water springs out of another. Guarantees are offered to savers in one bank or even in one country, immediately spooking those who aren't similarly covered. Even if the government in Britain did move to guarantee all bank savings, might not the panic simply move to the building societies? And once they had been dealt with at enormous cost, what's to say the insurance companies would not be next to feel the contagion of collapsed confidence? The result is that politicians seem dwarfed by the scale of the current crisis, either unable to act decisively at all - witness the statement of European finance ministers yesterday, agreeing on not much more than a ""coordinated framework"" for consideration of the problem - or to act decisively enough.  It's tempting to think this is a function of the quality of our leaders. If only an FDR was around, we say to ourselves, he would surely know what to do just as he knew how to steer America through the Great Depression. And yet that might be unfair on the current generation of politicians.  The reality is that in the balance of politics and the market, the scales tipped towards the moneymen a long time ago. The acclaimed historian of the postwar period, David Kynaston, describes as a ""fundamental revolution"" the breakdown of the old Bretton Woods system in the 1970s, ending the fixed exchange rates that had held since 1945. Once those rates could float, we entered the era of ""footloose markets"": finance could go anywhere and national governments could only look on helplessly. ""The politicians had their confidence battered,"" says Kynaston.  In Britain, Black Wednesday in 1992 added to the politicians' timidity. New Labour, then in embryo, watched as the Major government tried and failed to control financial events, pouring money into the system, raising interest rates twice in one day - and all to no avail. Gordon Brown learned the lesson all too well: there were limits to what politicians can do.  Now that impotence is on clear display and it is spreading alarm around the world. For people desperately want someone to get a grip. The left has been warning for years that corporations now enjoy more power than nation states, but never has it been clearer than it is now. The realisation is dawning that this is not just a financial or economic crisis, but a democratic crisis - the people and their representatives have little or no control over what affects them directly.  The solution is surely for governments to realise that if they are weak, the high priests of high finance are even weaker. The politicians should provide the help the banks need, but with the tightest of strings attached, regulating finance so closely that it can never again gorge itself the way it has these past few years.  Democracy has to assert itself once more - and tame this beast. freedland@theguardian.com",Jonathan Freedland: This crisis is one of democracy,2008-10-07T23:01:00Z,Jonathan Freedland,politics
"Last night's meeting of Gordon Brown, his chancellor, Alistair Darling, and their finance advisers was, to put it mildly, overdue. The outcome was further delayed until an announcement today. Anything less than an absolute guarantee of the nation's bank deposits, already in place in Ireland and Germany, is now unthinkable. Darling's statement to parliament on Monday beggared belief. The financial equivalent of al-Qaida had penetrated the nation's defences and placed explosive devices in every financial institution in the land. The threat to the economy was unprecedented and immediate. Yet all Darling could offer was to do ""whatever is necessary to maintain stability"" and say that it would be ""irresponsible to speculate on specifics"".  He mentioned no new cash to the money markets, no guarantees for personal or corporate deposits, no Europe-wide action and no bail-out for the banks. Indeed he said nothing, except to imply distaste for the emergency measures already being taken by foreign governments. He thus indicated that he would not join them. Nothing could have been more damaging to confidence than this non-statement. Darling wiped a mind-boggling £100bn off the value of the top 100 British companies, the biggest one-day fall in history, offering every economics student a vignette of regulatory ineptitude. If Darling's resignation were not the last thing Britain needs just now, he should offer it. Nor was the Bank of England any closer to reality. For months, its maverick monetary policy committee member, David Blanchflower, has been screaming for lower interest rates to aid company liquidity and avert recession. Yet the Bank remains inert, mesmerised by its (and the Treasury's) fixation with inflation. Worrying about inflation at present is like weeding the lawn when the house is on fire. When people lose confidence in banks, they put their money under the bed or send it to a better-ruled nation such as the Republic of Ireland. This does not spell the death of capitalism, as gleeful leftwingers claim. It shows what happens when unregulated capitalism overheats and suffers transmission failure. With the engine in neutral, confidence loses all traction. The only source of new credit is the government, backed by the future flow of taxes. Her Majesty's Government must become, for however brief a time, a bank. The need for that outcome is now glaringly obvious. Yet by nationalising only two banks, Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley, Darling has effectively undermined the others. If he now buys their shares cheap, he must be guilty of ""shorting"" them. For the government to become a bank it must not merely muse on the idea and discuss ""doing whatevers"" and ""pondering options"". It must get on with it. Whether this takes the form of indemnifying bank deposits, insuring interbank lending or buying bank shares - or all of these - does not matter. Absolute financial security must be underwritten. What makes Darling's dithering all the more extraordinary is that he and the Bank of England must have prepared for this for weeks. Yet their staff apparently told bemused emissaries of the big banks on Monday night that they were ""still working on a plan"". Darling has implied, over and again, that he will do the same as his Irish and German counterparts when they faced a bank collapse. He has parroted that he will do ""whatever is necessary to ensure stability"". Yet he will not say what this is, and indeed he objects to the actions of the Irish and Germans. The impression is of a man who simply does not know what to do, like Lord Lamont in the sterling crisis of 1993. The longer that deposit security is delayed, the more markets will withdraw cash and speculate against bank shares. It is not irresponsibility or panic that has led tens of thousands of Britons to move their balances out of the domestic system. They may be overreacting, but the chancellor has encouraged them to do so. Would you gamble your savings on Darling's decisiveness, or on that of the present governor of the Bank or England? The stupefying sums of money allegedly required to restore market confidence are not real. The indebtedness of banks is underpinned by real, albeit postponed, value in the economy. Assets ""recapitalised"", or nationalised, by the Treasury are sellable as the economy improves - as was British oil in the 1980s - and taxpayers should be able to benefit from the risks they have been expected to take. This will happen quicker when the Bank finally lowers rates and company liquidity is eased. When the historian Barbara Tuchman catalogued The March of Folly, she defined it as an act that was known to be folly at the time. Told-you-so may be odious, but the Treasury has been warned for years that its indulgence of cheap loans and smart trading practices was dangerous. Three weeks ago Darling was advised on all sides that in matters of confidence, over-bold intervention was preferable to too little too late. He and Brown have been taught a lesson in leadership by, of all people, the corporatist Europeans, people who have wisely circumvented last weekend's empty attempt at collective decisiveness. As for the House of Commons, where has it been? The date of its return to work is fixed by the grouse-shooting season. Its members and media acolytes have spent the autumn in a Neronian bicker over the survival of the prime minister, which was never in doubt, while the western financial system imploded. As the Commons roamed the moors, the US Congress negotiated, revised and passed an emergency banking bill inside a fortnight. A congressional committee is already investigating the Lehmans failure and is tearing Wall Street executives asunder. On Monday the Icelandic parliament, older even than Westminster, passed an emergency bill in hours. The banking bill may see the statute book sometime next year - Christmas and Easter holidays presumably permitting. As for investigating the behaviour of bankers and regulators, forget it. MPs nowadays delegate such unpleasantries to the press. They are too busy pleading for City directorships. Not since the 1970s has a British parliament seemed so useless and a nation's economy more at sea. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com",Simon Jenkins: Alistair Darling and the Commons ignored the ticking of bombs,2008-10-07T23:01:00Z,Simon Jenkins,politics
"It seems they are predicting the worst, gloomiest, skintest Christmas for 30 years. I suppose we're all supposed to think: 'Oh super!' and start droning on sanctimoniously about the evils of conspicuous spending and how, for too long, broken Britain has been riddled with consumerist greed, and weren't we all so much better off in the olden days with little more than a fresh orange and some monkey nuts in our stockings? Well, maybe I'm a bit common, but all I could think was, to hell with that, I'm not returning to the bad old days of golf-ball soaps and slightly crushed talc and flannel sets. This year of all years has been tough - my house is worth about a hundred grand less than I bought it for and I've spent the last 10 months wondering if I'm going to end up living in a cardboard box in the gutter, feeding my children spiders.  So forget about downsizing - spend some money on me and then spend some more! Which brings us to the vexed issue: where this Christmas is concerned, will it be a case of cometh December, cometh the class divide? First of all, talk about getting your punches in early. For this is exactly what seems to be happening, with headlines screaming: 'Fears of a tight Christmas'. You can only think, steady on - one hasn't even seen the first robin yet. The retail equivalent, the new Jamie Oliver book, has barely hit the shops. However, just as some people like to get their festive shopping done and dusted by November, Christmas-bashing seems to have started early this year, even before the tinsel hit the shops. One can understand why businesses are alarmed; with consumer spending slowing, banking in crisis and rents rising, the high street has a right to be concerned. Nor does it warm the cockles to hear that the number of households suffering fuel poverty is expected to hit 3.5 million. But this doesn't quite explain why the British public is being encouraged, nay commanded, to embrace our inner Grinch. Well, I say Grinch - the Grinch at least stole Christmas; there are some who just do their mealy-mouthed best to spoil it. Isn't this a mistake? Maybe I'm in the minority but I like Christmas, in all its forms. The family Christmas, the solo Christmas, even the 'Oh my God, why am I working?' Christmas. Just as it was traditional, down my way, to end the week with a life-affirming knees-up, ending the year in a similar fashion just seems right. A shame then that the global economic meltdown seems to have given those who despise Christmas the perfect excuse, a kind of moral Excalibur with which to smite down the plebeian masses who - miracle of miracles - might still, against the odds, be quite capable of looking forward to Christmas. Maybe that's why it's so irksome to be told we're all doomed to have the worst, gloomiest, skintest Christmas ever. It feels a bit like being cursed by the Chattering Class Fairy. We've all met them; we may even have been them. People who spend the best part of the winter months endlessly intoning about how the whole thing has become 'too commercialised'. Their implication is that everyone else is too thick to have noticed. Or perhaps we did, but decided to make peace with it, especially parents, realising that there can be no greater modern pleasure than festively flicking through the Argos catalogue, marvelling at the fab tat you can buy kids these days. This is the problem with the anti-Christmas lobby. They have some good points, but ruin their case with their life-sapping attitudes. They also prove what seems to be an almost unbreakable rule: namely, that the poorer you are, the more fun you're more determined to have. The richer you are, the more fun you're determined to stop. One wonders what their definition of over-commercialisation is. For the vast majority of Britons, their wildest festive dreams probably already peak at a carton of Belgian chocolates, some presents for the kids and a few 'Mummy and Daddy drinks' in the fridge. For people like this, the terminally downsized, what could you possibly take away - their paper hats at Christmas lunch? However, the most compelling reason for not getting sucked into any worthy Christmas drear is that it doesn't make sense. When you think about it, surely the only sane response to the filthy year we've all had is the biggest, stupidest party any of us can afford. A chance to remember (loved ones, close escapes, reasons to be grateful), but also a chance to forget (2008). So pull a cracker and stop moaning - Santa frowns upon party pooping. That's enough pictures of Lily Does model Lily Cole truly believe that her shoot for French Playboy (starkers save for ribboned pigtails, little girl socks and a big, fluffy teddy bear jammed between her legs) is 'art'? According to Cole: 'Nudity has always existed in art ...' (blah); 'It celebrates the human body ...' (witter); 'It doesn't necessarily debase ...' (doze). Absolutely, Lily, and I'm writing this stark naked, twirling nipple tassels. An unpleasant image, I grant you, but sometimes shock tactics are necessary. Anyway, Cole can talk. On the Playboy cover, she looks dangerously close to something Gary Glitter would use as a screensaver. Marks & Spencer defended Cole's Playboy appearance and so they should. You can't take the moral high ground when another of your models, the beauteous Noémie Lenoir, spends entire campaigns running around in her scanties.  But Lily, gorgeous, alien-faced, high-end Lily, what on earth possessed you? Was it because it was French Playboy (she'd have thought twice if it meant coming into proximity with Hugh Hefner and his rancid dressing gown)? Did they tempt her with the ultimate model-apple of 'edgy'? Whatever the incentive, Cole looks ridiculous. Ironically, there is an art to glamour modelling just as there is to catwalk, which means that interlopers such as Cole will always run the risk of being FWTKO (Famous With Their Kit Off). This is why I feel sorry for Cole. In the Playboy shoot, she doesn't look edgy, wild or 'out there', she looks like what she is - a silly, middle-class girl out of her depth. The whole thing reminds me of when Gail Porter posed for FHM all those years ago and ended up with her bottom superimposed on the Houses of Parliament: the same confusion between risk-taking and exploitation, the same self-justifying embarrassment. Lily should wise up. This sort of caper isn't art, it's soft porn, just as sleazy in its own way as the hard stuff and best left to experts. The last thing Obama wanted was OJ back in the news Should we pity Barack Obama? So near to the election, he may just be casting a wary eye at the new OJ Simpson case, where the former baseball player has been found guilty of armed robbery and kidnap. I happened to be in America the day Simpson was acquitted in 1995 for the murder of his former wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman and the white reaction was almost a caricature of shock and betrayal. I have heard from others that the black reaction seemed to be a similar cartoon ('The Juice is loose!'). Of course, this is far too simplistic. All over the world, there must have been many white people horrified to hear of certain items of rigged evidence (said to be an all-too-common Stateside practice when the accused is black). Equally, there must have been many black people quietly pleased when Simpson was found liable for the deaths in the subsequent civil trial. However, few would dispute that the 'trial of the century' was one conducted along strict racial lines, and that, for a distinct group of Americans, it was bad enough that a black man married a white woman, never mind slaughtered her. Ultimately, OJ represented an undercurrent in US society illuminated by Harper Lee in To Kill a Mockingbird - an innate fear and distrust, and mythologising, of 'the savage'. That's why Obama may be unsettled. It is not only Simpson returning to the headlines - that most toxic of cultural stereotypes, 'the black bogeyman', is back. How hard has Obama worked to dispel this entrenched racist myth - the big black guy, full of revenge and hate? He has jettisoned preachers, sidelined Jesse Jackson, faced down the Muslim tag and produced a regular guy wife and family. Even if Obama doesn't win, no one could deny that he has loosened the cap for any subsequent black candidate. Then up looms OJ, whose trial so dramatically polarised US race relations. Indeed, there may be an almost karmic symmetry to Simpson finally facing a life-sentence, even if is for kidnapping some sports memorabilia salesmen. But it could be equally argued that having OJ's face plastered everywhere may be a toxic cultural trigger that Obama and his camp just don't need.","Barbara Ellen: Lay off our Christmas, you joyless moaners",2008-10-04T23:01:00Z,Barbara Ellen,uk
"There is a good story lurking in My Judy Garland Life, not about the author's obsession with the dead singer, but about growing up in a family so large and ramshackle that by the time she came along, ""all the major personality types had been taken"". Boyt, a newspaper columnist and author of four novels, was the last of her mother's five children with Lucian Freud and half-sister to his small army of further offspring, estimated to number between nine and 40. Her memoir deftly elides these complications with her passion for the woe-struck star. Other people's obsessions, like accounts of their dreams and maundering love affairs, are only interesting if anchored to specifics the rest of us can identify with, the bathos of small things preposterously magnified. Growing up in ""a tall thin house with no foundations, in an eerie gothic London square"", Boyt was an over-reactor, sensitive to slights and ""keen to stay a child for as long as possible - for ever, if I could manage it"". She depicts herself as so desperately needy that ""when I met someone I really liked my first thought was, wouldn't it be wonderful if you suffered some sort of minor crisis/mild illness and I could be the one to help you through"". In Garland she saw someone who personified her own mute angst and legitimised feelings that Boyt had been taught to suppress - outrage, heartbreak, general turmoil and unravelling - but with a skill and humour that converted it to glory. The surprising word she uses for the star is ""gallantry"", and you know what she means. The problem with any memoir - that of how much to reveal - is exacerbated for Boyt by having a famous parent, something she addresses tangentially in essay-ish sections on the difference between healthy fan interest and mawkish obsession in Garland, ""good"" fans and ""bad"" ones. While examining her own hero-worship, the book's selective narrative provides an odd counterweight from the other side of the fame divide. References to her family are severely rationed. Her father's absence hangs over the book, as she implies it has over her life, and when he does appear, Freud seems benignly mystified by his daughter's outpourings; she is at once infuriated and frightened by him. The glancing moments between them are some of the best in the book. In conversation about Iris Murdoch he observes with casual excellence that ""some of her books are so muddled it's like a drawer with socks and shoes and even feet in it"". The reader's desire for more of this is not only denied but, one feels, disapproved of by the author as greedy and salacious. There are cryptic references to the heroin addicts who clogged up her mother's house when she was young and how emotionally short-changed she felt. ""My lazy heart wants to mourn all those who haven't loved me in the ways I've wished."" Who? What? Boyt doesn't say, and it feels at times as if another, more powerful book is trying to get out.  Still, it's a fun read. We go with her on lots of jolly escapades to Garland conventions and fan meetings, and on a drunken pilgrimage to the star's grave in New York with the world's foremost Garland expert, who, in recognition of Boyt's commitment to the cause, gives her a bangle the singer once wore, which he bought at auction. Her devotion takes into account its own ludicrousness with a deadpan tone that's both silly and serious. ""I'll never rent a film starring Lana Turner, just as I'll never read a book by Jung,"" she writes. (Turner once eloped with a man Garland was in love with.) Garland was the exemplar of the Woman Falling Apart in Public. Boyt, on the other hand, after her shaky start, has been surprised at how nice her life has been, with her husband and children in north London. Her need for the star hasn't waned for the simple reason that ""Judy makes me feel extraordinary things"". Not, she implies, in that way favoured by bad friends and psychoanalysts, of feeling lifted by revving on someone else's misery, but through the transcendence that comes with its perfect expression.  • Emma Brockes's What Would Barbra Do? is published by Black Swan.",Review: My Judy Garland Life by Susie Boyt,2008-10-03T23:01:00Z,Emma Brockes,review
"In the parallel universe in which I obviously live, much of what I am reading in the Guardian is not making much sense to me. Apparently Labour had a good conference, the Tories had a bad one and capitalism has collapsed. So presumably I won't be getting get paid for this piece with actual money but by some sort of barter system? Perhaps the editor of Cif could just come round and do my garden? When people don't know what is happening to them they turn to the experts and when the ""experts"" don't know they revert back to ideological, almost faith, driven assumptions. A prominent Tory told me the other night he had known about the impending collapse for three years, Vince Cable has been banging on about it for at least seven and Brown with his supposedly massive intellect ... well what did he know? Why did no one act? A week or so ago we had meltdown conjured as the collapse of mammon. A kind of three cheers and I told you so of attitude. Capitalism was always crap, we always said so and now we were being proved right. How satisfying. The fact that many people other than easily-despised bankers will lose their jobs, not be able to eat organic or care much about the planet as they can't pay for the basics doesn't seem to have bothered us unduly. Austerity as the answer to turbo-capitalism? Great if it just means one less holiday a year. Yet this is all wrong surely? The idea that we  don't manufacture anything anymore should possibly be of concern to those who profess themselves to be on the side of the working classes? But no, we are living in a weird bubble because the left (or what is said to constitute it) has no alternative to capitalism. It now stands simply for ""slightly more caring"", ie more regulated, forms of it. Yet so does David Cameron, and that is why I found the party conferences so at odds with the way they were reported.  Labour was a success because Brown got his wife out and she seems quite nice? No one stabbed Brown to death on stage or even during the collective binge drinking sessions? David Miliband didn't have a Hestletine moment or much of a moment at all? So all good then. The Tories apparently were over shadowed by events and Cameron's speech was overlong, dull and a return to much traditional Tory territory? That's not how I saw it at all. The special effect of Sarah Brown being used to humanise her dejected husband has a limited time span and is a totally retrograde step. It kept the lobby boys who work in a pack happy. I thought it rather desperate.  The Daily Mailness of Cameron's speech? Again there was more going on than that. Sure there were the Obama-lite meaningless passages about change but there is no doubt he pushes buttons beyond that of traditional Conservative votes. Cameron can deliver a speech because he bothers to talk directly to people and explain what he is about. You may not agree. You may not like it but Brown and those around him talk down to us as though we are rather annoying children. We shouldn't bother our heads with this economic business. Let them sort it out as they know what they are doing. Clearly they don't. No one does. So do you go with the personable financial advisor who sold you a dodgy insurance policy but waves and smiles every time he sees you or the grizzled, bad-tempered workaholic bank manager who you can never get through to on the phone anyway?  Global crisis means that the experience Brown claims or the change Cameron promises don't amount to much. What is really being offered is simply different styles of management. Times really are a changing. Does ""the left"" now champion the nationalisation of just about everything or does it applaud the fundamentally democratic instincts of the many Americans who do not want government to bail out big business? Whose side are you on boys? As far I can see a lot of people are playing fantasy politics, circa 1984. Fiddling while Rome burns? A full scale orchestra more like.

"   A collection of the postcards available at the Conservative party conference, 2008 Photograph: Martin Argles    First, they came for our language: social exclusion, inequality, redistribution, and now the great socialist idea of the big plan (as in ""plan for change""). Then, they raided our music: the Smiths, the Jam, even Billy Bragg. Now, they want our art. If you fancy it, you can leave party conferences hodding large bags of glorious tat. For the last couple of years Sky News's political Top Trumps have been the season's biggest hit, though having just been handed a ""Give Labour The Boot"" football, I'd say that they may have been eclipsed. But my favourite item from this year's Tory bunfight is a set of 12 postcards – on sale for a mere £3.50, and a glorious example of the Conservative genius for appropriating stuff from the opposite end of the political spectrum.     'There is such thing as society' postcard, Conservative party conference, 2008 Photograph: Martin Argles    They feature neat, primary coloured designs, and such slogans as ""Labour – wasting your money since 1997"" , ""By sharing responsibility, we help society grow stronger"", ""Social responsibility not state control"" and one very simple one: ""Change"". Now, they're obviously inspired by the great leftwing tradition of beautiful posters, but at first glance, they throw you something of curve (at this point, I will briefly go all Brian Sewell on you). Is it a Soviet thing? No: the absence of high-cheekboned farmhands, backwards typography and the odd tank rules that one out. Might they have taken their lead from the events of May '68, and the Parisian genius for silk-screen printing?     'Bye bye bureaucracy' postcard, Conservative party conference, 2008. Photograph: Martin Argles    Maybe, though they're a little too crisp and geometrical. And then the penny drops: they're mostly dead ringers for the classic political posters produced in Cuba: bold-but-arty, and based on a sense of human cuddliness rather than strident socialist realism. So, what next? The Cameronian equivalent of ""Patria O Muerte""? Michael Gove affecting his admirable stare into the jaws of destiny, and then photoshopped to resemble Che Guevara? Chris Grayling pictured in military fatigues, ending the dependency culture via shifts in the sugar fields? One final thought, though. What with global capitalism in apparent meltdown, and even the Daily Express going after the spivs and fatcats, perhaps all of this marks the end of a very ironic road. In fact, I hereby predict the proud return of the non-ironic socialist poster, and our side having the last laugh.

"Small and red headed, Hazel Blears was the Squirrel Nutkin of the 1997 intake: bright eyed, harmless and relentlessly, exhaustingly cheerful. To new Labour sceptics, she epitomised the naivety of the women and the upbeat apolitical postivism of the Blairites. In the Commons she was the one who asked the most egregious planted questions. In the studios, she was the first choice of broadcasters seeking a central-casting government supporter. But for all her conspicuous loyalty, it has been a long toil to the sunlit uplands of cabinet. This past month, though, something has happened to brand Blears, and it's not just stirring from the uber-Tory Michael Gove, who pronounced her ""excellent"" and a suitable candidate for a Cameron cabinet of all the talents. Her growing number of fans say it began with her doomed attempt at the deputy leadership in spring 2007. ""She got nowhere, but she learned a lot,"" a Labour councillor lurking in the margins of the Conservative conference here in Birmingham said yesterday. ""She's got good advisers, and maybe she's just lowered the volume a bit."" The departure of Blair from the scene may have had something to do with it too. No one can suppose now that her politics are anything other than her own, and it is easier for her to make herself heard.And it helps that she is absolutely passionate about the job she is doing. The department of communities and local government might have been constructed for this most activist of local politicians. She has the closest of ties with her constituency, Salford, where she was born and grew up and apart from a spell away at university (she's a solicitor by training) has lived ever since. Blears was in Birmingham this week too, appearing in the Sun Newspaper's Fixing Broken Britain travelling circus. It takes a certain courage and conviction to bring the fight to the enemy heartland – conference, not Birmingham – and she did it with a verve that had the Tories not exactly cheering, but definitely admiring. Last time she was in Birmingham, it was three weeks ago, for Gordon Brown's cabinet away day where it's said she told him he had to get his act together. Even a lunchtime fringe among the Tories – some of them sounding fresh from a Sun editorial – would have been easier than that. She minced up the hecklers (""I thought you were Rita Fairclough!"" – ""Well my mum did want to call me Rita, after Rita Hayworth""), hardly bothering with the footwork. When a councillor from Clwyd told her his new community beat manager – that's the local bobby – had to rely on the buses because she didn't have a car, Blears retorted that he was lucky to have one at all. No doubt she travelled on the buses so as to be among the community, nipping antisocial behaviour in the bud. You know Blears would. ""I'm a tribal politician,"" she told the audience, and she is, old school new Labour, proud to be working class, happy to exploit it – ""from Salford semi to cabinet table"" she boasted during the deputy leadership campaign, a voice from the ranks among officer class. ""I know about the white working class,"" she said, ""I'm part of it. I passed the 11-plus and I'm in the cabinet. My brother failed, he drives a bus."" But she's entitled to flash her roots. She has an authenticity that usually wears off successful politicians long before they get to the top, eroded away by ambition. And these past weeks, although the flaming hair and those relentlessly twinkly eyes are as shiny as ever, there is a depth and conviction to her political argument that has shone out at the Labour conference Manchester, on Question Time – and positively glowed among the Tories in Birmingham.",Anne Perkins: Hazel Blears positively glowed among the Tories in Birmingham,2008-10-01T11:45:17Z,Anne Perkins,politics
"There are multiple reasons why the current economic crisis is so toxic, but one additional, ­aggravating factor is that it is unfolding five weeks away from a US election. The disruptive effect of that was clear on Monday, when the US House of Representatives voted down President Bush's bail-out plan — a function of both his dead-duck status and the fears of 228 Congressman seeking re-election next month. The result is that the stakes in the contest between Barack Obama and John McCain, already stratospheric, have just got higher. The winner will be charged with leading the world through this economic ­convulsion and steering us all to safety. The current polls have Obama in front, but this contest could go either way. Those of us on the outside will ­follow every twist; it is a statement of the ­obvious that the entire world will be watching on November 4. But perhaps we shouldn't be. At least if my email inbox is anything to go by, we should have only the scantest interest in the ongoing US election. After all, it's got nothing to do with us. Or, as one emailer put it: ""We are electing the President of the United States and the world can choke on it."" His was one of a deluge of mainly hostile responses to a column that appeared here three weeks ago, arguing that the world's verdict would be harsh if Americans chose McCain over Obama. In their thousands, Americans wrote to tell me they read my words not as a simple prediction of the consequences of an American decision broadly to maintain the Bush-Cheney approach — but as some kind of threat. I was not merely commenting on the US election, they said, but intervening in it, seeking to blackmail American voters with the threat of global ostracism (as if I'm in a position to issue such a threat).  The counterblasts featured all the usual themes familiar to any columnist or blogger who wades into this terrain. America had saved Europe's ""ass"" twice before — and we would doubtless come bleating for help again when we inevitably sought rescue from the Muslim hordes imposing sharia law on London, Paris and Berlin. We can't defend ourselves, of course, because we are limp-wristed ""Euroweenies"", effeminate socialists whose own decline robs us of the right to say anything about the United States, which remains the greatest nation on earth.  Britain specifically forfeited the right to meddle in US affairs more than two centuries ago, when it lost the War of Independence. Besides, Obama is a Marxist, so Europe is welcome to him. One Bill07407 managed to capture the flavour of this virtual avalanche — including the curiously homoerotic undercurrent that runs through much rightwing American invective — with this effort: ""If you want Comrade Obama we will gladly ship him over after he loses in a landslide. Meanwhile you can kiss my ass. I bet you would enjoy it faggot."" Equally reflective, this from bioguy777: ""I love it! A pansy-ass limey Brit begs the US to do his bidding while his own country slips further towards total Islamic rule. We're electing McCain, and the rest of the world can piss up a rope if they don't like it. 1776, BITCH!"" In among the abuse were three ­arguments that need addressing. The first is that this election has nothing to do with those of us outside America (so ""butt out""). The trouble is, it has plenty to do with us. That has been true of every contest since 1945, when the US emerged as the sole superpower in the democratic world. But it has been undeniable since 2001.  Take Britain. Our soldiers have fought in two wars, Afghanistan and Iraq, that were wholly conceived and planned in Washington. Sure, it was Tony Blair's choice to take part in the invasion of Iraq, but that meant following a decision that had been made by an American president. No one doubts that had George W Bush decided the other way, Britain would not have gone to war in 2003.  If not blood, then treasure. The financial crisis now devouring British banks bears a three-word stamp: ""Made in America."" It was the US fad for sub-prime loans, handing out money to would-be homeowners who were not creditworthy, that triggered the credit crunch and, with it, the current turmoil. Yesterday President Bush acknowledged that its impact would be felt outside US borders when he sought to ""assure our citizens and citizens around the world"". Never was the hoary cliche truer: they sneeze and we catch a cold.  If war and economic meltdown aren't sufficiently persuasive, then how about a planetary emergency? The US is a first-rank contributor to the problem of climate change, responsible for a quarter of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, despite having just 5% of the world's population. But, as ­Thomas Friedman argues in his new book, Hot, Flat, and Crowded, the US is also indispensable to any solution. Only a radical transformation of America's approach to energy — generating it more cleanly and using less of it — could establish the kind of model and foster the technological innovation that would set a lead followed around the world.  So, Americans who say that since they don't poke their nose into our domestic affairs we should stay out of theirs, are making a bogus comparison. The battle of Brown v Cameron won't affect them. But the battle of Obama v McCain will affect me and every other Briton, ­European and citizen of the world. It could determine whether we are at peace or war, whether our ­economy thrives or enters a depression. This is not a mayoral election in rural Bulgaria, a purely internal matter of interest only to the locals. It damn well is our business. What's more, Americans would not have it any other way. They like to define their president as the ""leader of the free world"". So why is it such a cheek if the free world shows some interest in who that leader will be? Americans, you can't have it both ways: either you're the global superpower, in which case the world has a stake in your future direction, or you're not. But you can't act like ­America and expect to be treated like Liechtenstein: it doesn't work that way.  The second charge to be defeated is that to talk like this is somehow anti-American. The ­reverse is true. For what is prompting non-Americans to follow the ­current election so closely is not just an acknowledgement that the US is the dominant force in international life, but a yearning for America to lead once more. I saw that clearly in the crowd of 200,000 that greeted Obama in Berlin in July. They wanted to feel about an American president the way their parents had felt about John F Kennedy, to be awed once more, as Bill Clinton puts it, by the power of America's example, not the example of its power. And, for most non-Americans, that means an end to unilateral wars and a moral lead on climate change — not a continuation of the past eight Republican years.  Lastly, those Americans who say they don't give a ""rat's ass"" what the rest of the world thinks are letting themselves and their country down. America was never meant to be a closed, introverted nation, turning its back on the world. It has always aimed to inspire the rest of us, to be a shining city on the hill. In these autumn weeks, the world is ­looking to the city once more, hoping desperately that the light is not about to fade.  freedland@theguardian.com",Jonathan Freedland: McCain or Obama?

"Never be in opposition in time of war. When in danger the nation always puts its faith in authority. There were no marks for attacking Churchill before D-day or Thatcher before San Carlos. Whoever is to blame for this week's scenes on world stockmarkets, only the most churlish anarchist would welcome them. Hence David Cameron has an unenviable task in his speech today to his party conference in Birmingham. The British banking system is in systemic collapse. When it loses credit, when interest in futurity is sacrificed to daily survival, all wealth is at risk. It is even conceivable that the entirety of inter-bank lending may require nationalisation by the Bank of England, just to unblock the flow of credit. This ideological earth-shaker is a measure of the regulatory fiasco that culminated in the past week's events.  Cameron has behaved as sensibly as an opposition leader can. He has supported the Treasury and government, while criticising aspects of various bank rescue packages. But the reality is that government has ""gone national"" for the duration. Even the beleaguered Gordon Brown and his chancellor, Alistair Darling, lead their Tory shadows by 36 points to 30 in the confidence polls. The temptation for Cameron today must be to stand up, say nothing and sit down. The time for recrimination is later. The crisis may be a test of Brown's leadership, but it is one he is still sitting. Any quest for political capital from the Tories will be to Brown's advantage. If the headlines are far removed from Birmingham, there is the more reason for Cameron to use this opportunity to develop his still uneasy relations with his party and with modern Conservatism. He has recovered well from a slump in that relationship two years ago, by personal charisma and a talent for team selection. The voting intention polls have responded and a Conservative election victory has turned from a fantasy to a likelihood. Yet a question mark still hovers over Cameron's head. This is not the familiar jibe, that he is a man too sleek of mien and mind. His ability to de-class himself is remarkable. His Notting Hill greenery-yallery, his magnetic youthfulness, his deft handling of the mishaps intrinsic to modern politics, have all served him well. He wears with aplomb the mantle of Tony Blair, which he once rashly claimed. What is less clear is whether Cameron has learned where Blair went wrong. There is an ideological queasiness about his pronouncements, illustrated by the announcement from the shadow chancellor, George Osborne, proposing a two-year freeze on council tax. This came on top of commitments to single rooms in hospitals, unrestricted capital grants for ""choice"" schools, and enforced weekly rubbish collections. These are to be paid for by our old, dear friend ""cutting waste in government"". Such pledges indicate that Cameron has yet to find a new plot for his party. He talks the language of communal responsibility and decentralisation, as did Blair in the 1990s, but does not appear to understand what they mean in practice. He and Osborne follow Blair's toxic habit of mixing towering platitudes with the micro-management of what is now a punch-drunk public sector. The council tax freeze is the give-away. It is a bizarre pledge to subsidise councils that keep within a 2.5% targeted spending increase, so they can hold their tax increase to zero. It is de facto fiscal nationalisation. The only responsibility on councillors is to win a prize for meeting an Osborne target. This contrives to be both dirigiste and spendthrift at the same time, more Brownite than Blairite. Local tax freezes are cheap opposition but expensive government. When the Tories last threw money at such a freeze - in replacing poll tax with council tax in 1993 - they had to raise VAT to the highest in Europe. Since Labour came to Whitehall, the Treasury has been quietly pushing up council taxes again, allowing them to double over a decade. This has meant ever further curbs on local discretion, lest each rise become politically expensive. Pledges to end rate capping are simply broken. If Labour is merely frightened of local tax reform, Cameron is scared witless. It could be the undoing of his fiscal policy. No voter should ever believe a party that promises to spend more by ""cutting waste"". Thatcher pledged it, Major pledged it, Blair and Brown pledged it. They lied. It is not given to British central government to cut waste, for the simple reason that most waste is the result of frightened ministers trying to buy votes with overnight initiatives. That is why sensible European politicians delegate local taxes and services to locally elected politicians. One thing about Britain is becoming clear, that the ""social dislocation"" to which Cameron constantly and rightly draws attention stems from a loss of community responsibility and discipline. With a decline in respect for schools, churches, charities and clubs has gone a British obsession with regarding the police as a focus for local authority. This is a sure sign of participation in decline and democracy atomised. Brown vaguely declared last week that Labour was ""the party of family"". Likewise Cameron declares the Tories the party of ""the community"". What does this mean? The communities emerging from his and Osborne's imagination are the fiscally disempowered, politically neutered ghosts left by Margaret Thatcher's centralisation. There is no Tory programme for community strengthening, only more pledges to intervene in local affairs, whether to fix taxes or run rubbish collection, traffic, schools and hospitals. What business is it of Osborne how often my rubbish bin is emptied? Blairism was never more than an external critique of British government. It won power with a smile and a platitude, but in office it never found the levers that put policy into practice. Blair made government more centralised but less effective, and left the voters dissatisfied. Cameron has yet to show he understands this syndrome, that he must find ways of re-empowering communities if they are again to be a focus of social responsibility. The freeze on council tax is the opposite: a costly, centralising, vote-grabbing gimmick, which is perhaps why it is just for two years. <a href=""mailto:simon.jenkins@theguardian.com",Simon Jenkins: Cameron must show he can go beyond Blairite gimmicks,2008-09-30T23:01:00Z,Simon Jenkins,politics
"You only ever hear a nice thing about a teenager from a charity worker. Otherwise, parents, teachers, the police, the criminal justice system, all are united, just for this instance: adolescents are awful. This has permeated my consciousness so fully that when a teenage stranger does something nice, my worldview is so disturbed, and it takes me so much extra bigotry to get everything back on its axis, that the day would have been easier if it hadn't happened.  I read once that the pubescent growth spurt took so much raw energy that the individual's brain effectively shuts down, leaving only the reptilian section - responsible for eating, breathing, but also the base emotions of anger, lust, rage, paranoia and anxiety. It explains a lot about why everyone is so wary of them, but if they really have nothing more than a beast's functionality, is school the best place? Wouldn't they be better off in some kind of secure unit? And yet, we can't escape the fact that we all lived through this period and it didn't strike me that everything was my fault. This week's research about embarrassment cuts straight to the heart of this. According to Sarah-Jayne Blakemore, in a study for the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, adolescents use their medial prefrontal cortex even when considering situations that might cause them embarrassment; adults do not. Other emotions, not connected to the opinions of other people, are experienced in the same neural area by both teenagers and adults. So adolescents probably experience shame differently and more deeply, which is why they find their parents so appalling on so many levels.  Now that it's all neurological, there's no right and wrong. Who's to say which is the truer experience of embarrassment, between the fervour of adolescence and the relative nonchalance of adults? Do our brains mature, or just deteriorate? Impartiality is impossible: you just have to decide whose side you're on, between inner teen and outer adult. Instinctively, I would side with the adults, but then I think of my mother dancing to All Around My Hat and I still worry that my insides will liquefy.  Blakemore, questioned about the purpose of the study, said that adolescence was a key time in emotional development and, by extension, the development of mental illness. Overwhelmingly, the onset of depression and anxiety disorders, not to mention anorexia and similar will occur in this window.  The more we understand, the better. True, but I wonder about the underlying assumptions, whenever we detect a difference in the teenage psychological profile. Because many adolescent traits are antisocial - specifically volatility and aggression - the assumption is that the immature mind is always disharmonious, where the mature mind always works towards community, or, at the very least, is more civic-minded than it was when it was 14.  But embarrassment, surely, has a social imperative. In so many respects, and most of all in the business of getting laid, it pays to be disinhibited. So if shame didn't have some rolling benefit, we surely would have collectively bred it out, like gills and webbed toes?  I have always associated embarrassment with deficiency, an underpowered engine of self: ""what will people think?"" is a very small-town mantra, and runs counter to the values of individualism that broadly characterise the culture. But individualism and isolation are a hair's breadth apart; unshackle yourself entirely from shame, and sooner or later everyone is living alone, emerging only to be naked and whistle. Maybe adolescents only went into embarrassment overdrive because the rest of us weren't taking it seriously enough. Maybe we're the feckless ones, and they're the ones trying to hold it together. Maybe they're not reptiles after all. mszoewilliams@yahoo.co.uk",Zoe Williams on the uses of adolescent embarrassment,2008-09-30T23:01:00Z,Zoe Williams,society
"In the analysis that followed Sarah Brown's first, acclaimed contribution to political life, her shoes were identified as LK Bennett (£129); her black skirt traced to Scottish designer Graeme Black (£400); ditto the grey top (£350); her jewellery, though still to be sourced and costed, was revealed to be the model's own, presented to Sarah Brown by her husband, 'according to aides'. These would be the same aides, presumably, who divulged that Mrs Brown had announced only at lunch on Tuesday, barely two hours before he spoke, that she would be introducing her husband at Labour's conference, 'jotting down' one or two ad-hoc comments 30 minutes before she addressed several thousand delegates. Assuming this impulsive show of loyalty did not in fact occur to her over breakfast or, as some said, somewhat earlier, at around three in the morning. That's if inspiration did not, in fact, arrive - as Mr Brown testified - a month or so before that, in the summer, around the time she began to be a more visible public figure than the Prime Minister. But who cares about the precise timing? Or whether Sarah's was, or was not, a genuine surprise for hubby that now ranks alongside Marilyn Monroe's 'Happy Birthday, Mr President' and Princess Diana's unexpected pas de deux with Wayne Sleep, that loving tribute to a horrified Prince Charles? What does it matter when the thing is generally agreed to have been a triumph? Grocers are thought to be particularly moved by this sign that the Prime Minister has reviewed his recent criticism of bogof marketing techniques, on the basis that the bonus part of the buy-one-get-one-free package often ends up in the trash, destroying the planet. Although this does, indeed, seem to apply to Mrs Tony Blair, whose book, Speaking for Myself , was one of the most frequently discarded reads of the summer, the delirious response to Sarah Brown suggests that, if anything, she has turned Brown's theory on its head. It is costly Gordon we would like to chuck out, not Sarah, who offers, entirely free, gratis and unelected, everything her spouse does not: a pleasing manner, unforced smile and an utterly plausible command of scripted sincerity, even when saying things such as: 'I'm so proud that every day I see him motivated to work for the best interests of people all around the country.' With talent like that, they should try her on the moral compass. Or its successor catchphrase, the 'I wake up in the morning thinking of [insert relevant section of the electorate]' sincerity template which invariably leaves you wondering which option is more dismal: that Brown believes this drivel to be worth repeating or that it is, in fact, an accurate depiction of his private life. Certainly Sarah's 'every day I see him motivated' tribute could be read as corroboration of Brown's insistence on his diurnal sacrifices, as in: 'Every effort of mine, every day that I wake up, is about keeping this economy moving forward.' But, lovely, intelligent and sane as she is, how far can Sarah be trusted to tell the truth about Gordon? She is, after all, a professional PR, albeit a more accomplished one than David Cameron ever was. And even if she were not a skilful saleswoman, what would you expect Mrs Brown to say about 'my husband, the leader of your party, your Prime Minister'? That - every day - she wakes up thinking she can't stand another second of his oxygen-sapping company? That, moreover, we should also be aware that the last few months have been for her a living hell, during which the grumpy old bastard, driven half-mad by insomnia and the inescapable evidence of his own fiscal incompetence, has done little but rock and moan and curse David Miliband - in that newly acquired smiling-voice that is all the more sinister for being so much softer? But not to worry, since they work as a team and she has personally arranged to have £40bn injected into the British economy, so as to keep everyone in credit. Although it cannot help that Mrs Brown is one of those political novices whose opinions are redundant at this very serious time, her endorsement remains, in any case, worthless. Desperation, presumably, has prompted her mercy dash from obscurity; she must know that the price of this intervention will be her privacy. Media curiosity will not, now that Sarah is a property, be satisfied with last week's valuation of her outfit and some faux-kindly observations on her 'curves'. What does she think about Ruth Kelly's kids? How does she deal with stubborn stains? Aren't we all keen to hear more, now she's speaking up, so long as it's not: 'I want to be alone'? There was some sympathy for Clarissa Eden, when she said she sometimes felt that the Suez Canal was running through her drawing room. But that was because she hadn't parked her whatnot in the Tory party conference. If Mrs Brown is prepared for the invasion of her private life that will follow her unsolicited intrusion into the public one, this variation on suttee may not, however, be the most helpful precedent for her successors and rivals, particularly the shyer ones. How do Mrs Miliband and Mrs Cruddas - and one does hope they exist - feel about public testimonials and kisses? Do they know what their husbands think about every morning? Not that the answers matter much, of course, if they can get the clothes and hair right. In the circumstances, ambitious young candidates might want to reconsider any partner whose future sacrifice might fall short of Brownian self-immolation or, at any rate, of a willingness like Mrs Nick Clegg's, to prance round a pointless conference when they appear to be at the point of giving birth. If the public, with Sarah Brown's encouragement, will soon be emulating traditional Tory matrons in its assessment of potential first ladies, other key qualities bachelor MPs might look for include careful (but not showy) grooming, matching accessories and an unostentatious commitment to the senior spouse's values. And girls - team a black skirt with a nice little jacket in a jewel colour and it will take you anywhere. Within reason. With the current glut of personable political wives, it seems amazing that feminism could ever have questioned the dignity of the full-time helpmeet, in all her glorious dependence. In fact, it seems amazing feminism ever happened at all. Imagine a political world without Mrs Obama's signature frocks and Mrs McCain's interesting mustard ones; one that featured neither the enchanting Mrs Sarkozy nor the handbag inventor, Mrs Cameron, whose appearance at the Tory conference will no doubt compensate, in its mute foxiness, for any deficiencies in her husband's speech. Can she also see off Sarah Brown? 'Every day,' as Gordon likes to say, 'you wake up and you know there's going to be a new challenge.' On Wednesday, its name is Samantha Cameron.",Catherine Bennett: Why did my heart sink when Sarah Brown stepped on to the stage?,2008-09-27T23:01:00Z,Catherine Bennett,politics
"It would seem the time has come to get on the Batphone and tell the campaigning dads of Fathers 4 Justice, Families Need Fathers, and all the other angry dad groups that they can now wriggle out of their superhero costumes, for, gentlemen, surely your battle is won?  A study by the Oxford Centre for Family Law and Policy was set up by the Ministry of Justice to look into non-resident parents being awarded little or no contact with their children for the flimsiest of reasons. Last week, the study concluded that the vast majority of separated fathers enjoy access to their children. Only one in 10 cases ends up in court, the rest having been agreed between the parents. When the cases do go to court, more than three-quarters of the applicants, mainly fathers, are able to resolve contact issues, with only a small percentage denied contact altogether, in the interests of the children involved.  Not bad, in fact, pretty reasonable. Why then have these findings not been met with cries of joy from disgruntled campaigning fathers? There's just been some low-key muttering about how that's all very well, but what about the 'presumption of shared care'? Could it be, as I have long suspected, that, for many members of fathers' groups, it's always been less about justice-seeking than it has been about attention-seeking? While these fathers' groups may have been set up with the best of intentions, they evolved all too quickly into social clubs for miserable sods who wanted a free pass to whine about women. Indeed, these past years, isn't it arguable that these campaigning dads have done more than any spiteful female to denigrate and undermine the concept of fatherhood, not to mention make a farce of it? Consider for one moment the frightening thought patterns that lead a grown man to think dressing up as Spiderman is his best shot at being taken seriously. Does a man like this have the Spidey sense he was born with? More seriously, going by my experience with family courts, have dads ever really had it that bad?  I wasn't remotely interested in barring contact between my daughter and her father. However, I couldn't help noticing that had I wanted this, to get anywhere, I would probably have had to produce camcorder footage of him tying her to a railway line while wickedly twiddling a luxuriant moustache. This is the truth of family courts - they are proactive almost to a fault about finding a way for the non-resident parent, male or female, to maintain contact with their children. They are fixated by this issue to the virtual exclusion of all others, which is the way it should be - whether the mother likes it or not.  However, contrary to the impression groups such as F4J give, mothers generally do like their children to have a father - you don't often see women on Jeremy Kyle shows wanting a paternity test to proves someone isn't the father. And women want fathers around not only for the priceless input of positive male influence, but also for the Holy Grail that all mothers, single or otherwise, seek - safe and reliable childcare. And there lies the bottom line. However badly the relationship ended, if he's a half-decent, committed dad, it's a rare and stupid woman who'll let go of him, not only for the child's sake, but her own - think of all the free babysitting.  In this way, it becomes clear that the real reasons a woman might not want the biological father around are just that - real reasons - ultimately to do with genuine fears about him hurting or upsetting the children or disrupting their lives in some way. In the special case of a 'campaigning dad', add maybe his inability to see past himself, his own pain, his own axes to grind, while doing his best to make his rage and ego seem like a noble quest.  It says something that one hears stories about how some of these campaigning dads fail to show up to see their children because they're far too busy ... campaigning to see them! It makes you wonder who's in those costumes - are they genuinely wounded and devoted dads or drama queens who find the cause far more exciting than actual fathering could ever be? It's time for disgruntled, estranged dads to realise that women simply cannot stop men being fathers. Only men can stop men being fathers. Indeed, all things considered, maybe the MOJ study might be a good opportunity to disband these groups for good. Let's face it, no one ever said that families didn't need fathers - there was just the suggestion that, once in a while, they could think about climbing out of their Batman suits and doing some actual fathering. Now he's laughing all the way to the bank, Banksy's a bore Banksy, the graffiti guerrilla artist, has formed a 'pest fund' to identify the hundreds of works attributed to him that aren't actually his. He is also urging people not to take any of these works, or to buy them, unless they have been created for sale and officially authenticated. Wow - how renegade, how 'out there'. It's like van Gogh hacking his ear off all over again. Except it isn't. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought this type of art was all about madness and impetuosity, as well as challenging the very definition of what art is or could be. So surely the fake Banksys fit right in. If guerrilla artists can run amok, why not fake guerrilla artists or even guerrilla art lovers?  Yet here we see Banksy whingeing about wanting everything officially authenticated and fastidiously pointing out which spray-canned doodles are his. 'Nah, that rat shitting in a Starbucks cup ain't mine. Nor that one of Ann Widdecombe lap dancing neither.' Amazing isn't it how once someone's work starts selling for big bucks how corporate and humourless they become? Mind you, some of us always had doubts. There's been lots of speculation about who Banksy is - a man, a woman, a gang? - but there's no doubt what he's become - just another art book talking point on the coffee table, the 21st-century equivalent of those 'amusing' clacking balls businessmen used to have on their desks. But maybe this is sour grapes. There is what I thought to be a Banksy at the top of my street. It's a Che Guevara sketch which, feeling a bit broke, I had half a mind to chisel off and hotfoot it to Sotheby's with. As Che is not doing anything peculiar, such as changing a baby's nappy or French kissing Stalin, I had this romantic idea that Banksy might have suffered sprayus interruptus and had to run off before he'd finished. Now I realise that it's just a fake, it seems more authentically Banksy than ever. Paul McCartney ... is he arrogant or serially henpecked? It's difficult for vegetarians such as myself to criticise Paul McCartney. We view him as a kind of living god, soya-based version. But what on earth was he up to with that gig in Tel Aviv? Criticised for not also playing Palestine, and for costing more to protect than President Bush, McCartney could only blather pompously about 'helping the peace process in my own small way [blahhh] talking to Palestinians and Israelis, [drone] finding out for myself what the situation is'. Oh the agonising stupidity and arrogance of the man! What next - an appearance in bin Laden's next cave video. 'Come on, Osama, pull up a tasselled cushion and let al-Qaeda give peace a chance!' At first, I thought, this isn't McCartney's fault. Such is the Fab Four's influence that, just like the Queen smells fresh paint everywhere she goes, all Macca hears is Beatles worship: 'We love you Paul, your music heals us' and all that suck-up. Hence the possibility that McCartney genuinely believes that the Israel-Palestine conflict can be helped with a quick burst of 'Yesterday' and a cheeky thumbs-up. Then a dark thought occurred. Was Tel Aviv just more evidence that McCartney is the most pussy-whipped music icon ever? A former Beatle who lets his birds boss him around and tell him what to do. Think about it. It was lovely Linda who turned Paul on to vegetarianism. Then there was all that rolling about with seals with Heather. Now he has a Jewish girlfriend, the glamorous Nancy Shevell, he's suddenly playing concerts in Israel and 'finding out for myself what the situation is'. Suspicious? I think so.

"Birmingham should be the scene of a celebration. For the first time in 21 years, the Tories gather for their party conference buoyed by a lead in the polls. In the past few months they have notched up substantial victories, most notably at Crewe and Nantwich and, best of all, in London. They look across at a Labour government eating itself, plagued by the same disease that once ravaged the Tories: rancour, fatalism and insatiable plotting. The inevitable, and heavy, corporate presence at this week's conference will confirm what has long been true: that the Conservatives now give off the smell of imminent power.  And yet this is unlikely to feel like a carnival week. For one thing, Conservatives are under strict orders to hide all signs of premature crowing. David Cameron knows how bad it will look if Conservatives are whooping it up while everyone else braces for recession. Tomorrow's planned collective backslap for the string of recent electoral victories has been scrapped to make way for an emergency session on the economy.  But it's not just a matter of appearances. The paradox is that this week is both the first conference to open with a poll lead since 1987 - and the first time in 12 months that the Conservatives have been on the defensive.  The immediate cause is Labour's relatively successful conference in Manchester. If Gordon Brown had botched his Tuesday speech, the Tories would be licking their chops as Labour plunged into immediate civil war. Instead, the prime minister got good reviews and a modest bounce: the Guardian poll today finds the Tories still ahead, but with their lead cut down from 15% to single digits.  That fits with a more nebulous sense, apparent in the coverage of Brown's speech, that the press corps is making one of its periodic collective, if unspoken, decisions to change the narrative. The ""Brown as dead man walking"" storyline has begun to pall. Reporters like nothing more than a contest: if they are not going to get an internal one on the Labour side for a while, then they'll have to make one between Brown and Cameron. But these are only the most superficial of the forces pushing the Tories on to the back foot. The serious and larger one is the most obvious: the world is in economic turmoil. Ordinarily that spells doom for incumbents, and it could well work that way in Britain, finishing off Brown and Labour. But it can also spell trouble for oppositions.  The immediate risk for Cameron is that he is simply dwarfed by the scale of the meltdown. One cabinet minister this week said he regarded Cameron as a ""good times"" politician, his smiley, wind-turbine brand of politics fine when the sun is shining but too lightweight for grave times such as these. It sounds wishful, but the minister might have a point. Blair's sunny style, which worked so well in the prosperous 1990s, might not have connected in a recession either.  This could explain why Brown's jibe that this is ""no time for a novice"" struck home. Home Office minister Tony McNulty said that at that moment he could feel Cameron and George Osborne shrinking back into short trousers. He was crediting that to Brown's speech, but the real trouser-shriveller is surely the economic crisis itself.  For this leaves a party of the centre-right in an awkward spot. Just look at the wild vacillations of John McCain. Ten days ago he declared that ""the fundamentals of the economy are strong""; come Wednesday, he was warning that the entire system was on the verge of collapse and could only be rescued if he and Barack Obama cancelled their TV debate. After a lifetime spent slashing regulation, he posed as a street-fighting populist denouncing Wall Street ""greed"". The only message he sent was confusion. The Tories have so far avoided similar levels of contradiction, but they are in a corner. The financial lunacy exposed over the past fortnight has blown apart the neoliberal case for the unfettered free market. Publics in both Britain and America now yearn for the referee to get back on the pitch and start imposing some rules. Yet the Conservatives are saddled with a near-religious belief in the free market. The shadow chancellor did indeed say that ""people making money out of the misery of others"" is a ""function of capitalist markets"".  The Tories will probably decide that the best defence is offence, and lash out. They will mock Brown for boasting during the years of feast that he had banished famine forever, abolishing boom and bust. They will blame him too, arguing that he should have weathered Britain better against the coming storm, halting this ""age of irresponsibility"" where we've lived high on personal debt. But they can hardly fault him for a decade of light-touch regulation, because they would have done exactly the same.  Rhetoric apart, what action might they promise? The Tories surely have something large up their sleeves. How else to explain their silence during this dizzying fortnight. Osborne has form in this regard: it was his bombshell announcement on inheritance tax during last year's conference that shook up British politics, blocked an imminent election and put the Tories out front. Remember, Osborne's move last year included a step that outflanked Labour from the left, seeking to tax non-doms. He could do the same this year by proposing a cap on runaway executive bonuses. If he did, it would be hugely popular, from the Mail to the Mirror.  Or might he go even further? The talk of the Labour conference was MP Jon Cruddas's neat proposal to take 580,000 people out of the top rate of tax, effectively leaving only those earning more than £50,000 eligible - a middle-class tax cut - paid for by taking more from those earning in excess of £175,000. Could Osborne steal that idea, adapting it so that it only squeezed the super-rich, say those earning more than £250,000 or even £500,000? I wouldn't put it past him. It would prove that the Tories really had changed and that they dealt in action, not just talk. They could claim to be both popular and progressive - and they would leave Labour floundering.  It might not happen. But if the Tories don't come up with something, they will remain on the defensive - and for longer than just one week in Birmingham.  freedland@theguardian.com",Jonathan Freedland: George Osborne has the potential to leave Labour floundering,2008-09-26T23:01:00Z,Jonathan Freedland,politics
"I was flicking through Debrett's New Guide to Etiquette & Modern Manners, wondering what I could find to hate next, and found myself dawdling at the section on babies. ""Do not imagine that it's acceptable to react to the blood-curdling yells of a baby with an insouciant shrug and the words, 'Don't worry, he's just a bit tired,'"" it said. Which is 100% true. There is almost always a tired old cliche at the end of books on manners - a lot of rehashed faux-poshery, dancing around behaviour that no longer even exists in the real world, in its feverish insistence that there is still a code, and that aristocrats still hold the key.  But those screaming babies ... still a cliche, but because it's true. It's a mystery of parenthood that you lose the ability to empathise. You think everyone responds to child noise with concern for the child. You don't realise they just want the child to go away, and you with it, if that will make it happen faster. In the interests of social harmony, these are points worth making again and again, and where better to do it than in a book about manners? The problem is, all this stuff is inherently obnoxious. If you insist that there is a particular way of doing things, and only one, then you insist upon the status quo. I can, against all odds, actually prove this: when you consult Debrett's on ""political correctness"", it tells you how disheartening and absurd it all is, this tedious business of having to rein in your bigotry a bit, and finishes: ""One could get depressed that, with the real problems facing our world, anyone could get distracted by such nonsense.""  Now, I refer you to its entry on sexism: ""There are bigger fish to fry than the odd sexist comment or gender stereotyping."" Come on then, poshos, where are these big fish? Where is your section on the real problems facing the world? Ah, here it is: ""Pips and stones (cherry, olive, etc) should be discreetly spat into a cupped hand and deposited on the side of the plate or discarded."" We are much too busy, ladies and gentlemen, to discuss the rights and wrongs of the only ideas/conversations that have happened over the past 50 years, and yet we do have time to tell you that you shouldn't just gob your olive stones in anyone's face.  In the steady erosion of ideological clashes, we might think that the pressing political issue is who smiles and who doesn't. This is erroneous - there is a swamp of belief that makes the left wing and the right wing really noxious to one another; but because it is so muddy, it really creates more of an atmosphere than a debate. Both sides think they have a monopoly on social responsibility, and that on the other side it's every man for himself. The left justifies this with its talk of wealth distribution, and the right does it by banging on about manners. On the level of practical application, they're both blowing it out of their hat anyway - since the left, given the chance, doesn't redistribute, and the right, for all their talk, are in fact the first to barge into you on the street and try to kill you when they're in a 4x4 and you, being on the left, are not.  What's interesting about this rhetoric is not that it's hypocritical, nor that it's tenacious, but that political movements are like jealous siblings - they stake claims to characteristics and ring-fence them, warding off competitive attentions to the point that everyone ossifies into a position that doesn't necessarily describe them at all. There is no reason that the left shouldn't be as courteous as the right. Rocking the boat and insisting on being treated as an equal even though you are disabled/female/short - well, that might be, according to Debrett's, bad manners - but that doesn't mean that courtesy cannot take in pioneers. David Cameron, when he does his ""broken society"" number, makes it sound such a neat segue, from promoting etiquette to tax-rewarding marriage; but it's a sleight of hand, and one that the left, indeed anyone thinking of themselves as a social liberal, has accepted for far too long. We accept it because we think it means conformity, using the right knife and fork, knowing how to address a bishop and where to stay in Chicago; we think it is just the polish of wealth. Naturally, then, it riles to be told how to do things, it feels like an oblique way of ramming home that the wealthy make the rules, and every now and then do us the favour of telling us what they are. But it's a mistake to cede this ground entirely - first, because manners are not just accessories; often they are more about thoughtfulness and altruism, and other things that constitute the very fabric of society. Second, because some of this stuff is true. Screaming babies are annoying. It's nicer if you don't shout at cold callers. And they're right, you know.

"He clunked and he frowned and he sometimes smiled, and he defied all- comers. Labour and Tory could do their worst but he would not move. Gordon Brown yesterday did exactly what his fair-weather friends should have expected of him. He refused to give an inch to the merchants of political manoeuvre. This hugely serious man summoned up his powers of Presbyterian oratory and declared simply: ""There is a lot to be serious about."" The stag is finest when at bay. Brown should never have become prime minister, and there is hardly a creature in the political jungle who does not know it - and precious few who did not know it a year ago. Only Tony Blair's 1994 pact with the devil made it inevitable, thus ensuring that his fidgety, insubstantial era would end in tears. A decade at the Treasury took a terrible toll on Brown's capacity for passion. Earlier this month, when a nation was avid for his ""leadership relaunch"", he hit it with cavity-wall insulation grants. He is now set on reinvigorating his poll support with educational technology allowances and free theatre tickets, broadband and circuses. Yet there was no sign yesterday of the moody, defeatist misery that the prime minister has appeared to be immersed in over recent months. Brown went to inordinate lengths to heed his critics. He avoided lists and was almost Blairite in his ""yunnos"" and levity of detail. His theme was that old cliche, a fair society, and even his specifics were abstract. The financial crisis is to be countered not with policies but with a ""new global settlement"", involving transparency, soundness, integrity and standards. There was even a canter round the old ""duties and responsibilities"" track. If Brown overdosed on platitude, at least it could be self-referential and pointed: ""My children aren't props, they are people"", ""I didn't go into politics to be popular - perhaps just as well"", and ""I'm all in favour of apprenticeships but let me tell you this is no time for a novice"" (whether directed at George Osborne or David Miliband was not clear). Nor was there any engagement with the minutiae of foreign affairs. This must surely be the first prime minister in time of war never once to discuss or justify it to his party conference. Brown has now to perform the task he yesterday set himself, to show the British people that the custodian of economic collapse ""can be the rock of fairness and stability on which they can depend"". This crudely means turning a world financial crisis to his advantage - to be what the 19th-century political scientist Max Weber called an ""occasionalist"". Weber's perfect leader seizes on any and every passing event and bends it to his will. Blair, like Margaret Thatcher, could take a royal death, a terrorist bomb, a war, even a recession, and somehow use it as a prop for his own position. He would have taken the current crisis as a sign of a global threat from dark satanic forces and pleaded with the nation to place its savings in his hands. Somehow it would have worked, for a while. Brown last year was granted both a bomb and a flood, and has now been given a recession. Yet occasionalism is not bred in his bone. For all his claim of ""new challenges"", he is still vulnerable to the charge that claiming credit for a financial boom involves accepting blame for a crash. Even as he adopts the language of charismatic conviction, Brown is easiest with that of cavity-wall insulation and broadband vouchers. The prime minister's supporters last year lauded a return to high seriousness in British politics, and an end to spin and gimmick. He has given them high seriousness in spades. To turn his back on the new politics of charm is a gamble, but it is simply the only gamble he knows. There is to be no song-and-dance act, no Auld Lang Syne, about this political recovery, just a long hard slog. He has at least been lucky in the tactical ineptitude of his opponents. It is a mystery what advantage there was to David Miliband - his claim to the succession acknowledged - in prancing about Manchester like Prince Hal trying on the crown. His admitted mimicking Michael Heseltine at Tory conferences in the 1980s was positively ghoulish, given Brown's tribulation: the straying beyond his ministerial brief, the damning of the leader with faint praise, the availability to every photographer and fringe meeting. Brown knows these tricks, since he used to torment Blair in much the same way. Perhaps he should remember Blair's great error, in failing to punish a man so blatantly styling himself his successor. Miliband suddenly looks foolish and vulnerable. The Labour leader is a big beast who is not going to go quietly. Blair's constitutional reform ensured that any toppling would be bloody, and probably require a split in the party's upper echelon. This would increase calls for a swift general election, at which the party would be devastated. The only MPs stupid enough to want that are ones whose seats are safe, and there are few of those at present. Politics always goes mad at conference time. It is when public affairs take a back seat and ambition removes its disguise. Thatcher almost fell at such a moment in 1981. She was in the depths of a recession and fiercely unpopular among senior colleagues, convinced that she was going to lose them the next election. Alan Clark recalled that there is nothing that drives Westminster delirious quite like insecurity at the top. At the scent of blood in the water, the sharks glide towards it, circling for the kill. It is the survival of the fittest. There is time and tide enough to pass between now and the formal end of this parliament in 2010. Tail-end leaders often do unexpectedly well at the polls. Douglas-Home almost won in 1964 after 13 years of Tory rule. John Major won an unprecedented popular vote after a similar span in 1992. Neither was an exciting or popular leader. Who knows but Brown, too, may find 13 years his electoral lucky number. Either way, he yesterday showed no sign of being a man who feels his job is finished or his ambition spent. He plainly expects those who queued sycophantically at his door just a year ago to stick with him in his time of trouble. He will now get that support. He knows that Labour is good at sadism, but terrible at murder.simon.jenkins@theguardian.com",Simon Jenkins: This was not the speech of a leader about to be unseated,2008-09-23T23:01:00Z,Simon Jenkins,politics
"Who are they? Where are they now? They said it could not happen again. They said they were masters of the universe. They had conquered history itself and had that wily monster quivering at their feet. There would be no more crashes, no more recessions, no more booms and busts, just moonbeams and rainbows and jam for tea. If the mistakes that have collapsed the world's financial markets had been made by statesmen and had led to war, there would be corpses swinging from lampposts. If they had been made by generals, they would be falling on their swords. If they had been made by judges or surgeons or scholars, some framework of professional retribution would be rolling into action. But those responsible for our finances can apparently vanish into the forest like Cheshire cats, leaving only gold-plated grins. Not for them a Hague tribunal or a Hutton inquiry. They are not just good at shedding risk - they shed blame. We are seeing what historians of ideas call a paradigm shift. In the last century, the necessities of war and the rise of socialism thrust government intervention to the fore. When that failed in the 60s and 70s, the ""Reagan-Thatcher revolution"" turned the emphasis back to private enterprise and deregulation. That era has ended with astonishing abruptness. Governments in Britain and the US have been nationalising and spending public money with a will that would have made Attlee or Roosevelt blush. Those of us who learned economics in the old days were taught that banks had to be regulated oligopolies because their role in a capitalist economy was crucial. It relied on the sustenance of public trust which only government, backed by the citizen as taxpayer, could dispense. In Britain, retail banks, merchant banks and building societies were legally distinct, separated by barriers to prevent cross-pollution of the sort that caused the 1929 crash. JK Galbraith's book on that crash is the Dr Strangelove of financial holocaust. If it offers one lesson, it is that crashes are not acts of God; they are caused by the interaction of corporate behaviour and state regulation. Nor does the market supply its own discipline. Understanding that, wrote Galbraith, ""remains our best safeguard against recurrence"". Such lessons learned in youth tend to stick. Hence I remember feeling queasy when Thatcher's ""big bang"" of 1986 demolished the firewalls and permitted the trading of risk and reward across the entire financial sector. It was a reform repeated in the US with the repeal of the post-depression Glass-Steagall law. The same nervousness greeted each subsequent shock to the system - the 1991 housing crash, Lloyd's of London, Barings, Enron, Northern Rock. Each time we were assured that new lessons had been learned. Light-touch regulation was working fine, even if sometimes boys will be boys. The naivety of all this is now exposed. Politicians encouraged the public to treat home ownership as a ""right""; property became the citizen's gilt-edged stock. Bankers encouraged staff to speculate with depositors' money by awarding them huge bonuses to maintain turnover. Those charged with the guardianship of other people's savings behaved, in effect, like thieves. Sheer greed drove young men and women mad. Nobody in authority batted an eyelid. At the same time Gordon Brown ""set free"" the Bank of England to fix interest rates. I recall one commentator telling me that I should be ""overjoyed your children and grandchildren will now never have to experience inflation"". No, they are just unemployed. It was a charade. On the back of low inflation, the Bank fuelled a credit boom that was clearly vulnerable if prices rose and/or credit collapsed. Both have occurred. There is no such thing as a ""non-political"" official rate of interest. The Bank is now under pressure both to cut rates to beat recession, and yet raise them to beat inflation. It cannot do both. Since it would be 1929-style lunacy to increase rates just now, Brown must in effect tell the Bank to reduce them by shifting his inflation target. It is a blatant and properly political decision. There is no perfect market. Markets need regulation, just as communities need law. Yet as Galbraith again wrote, regulators may start life ""vigorous, aggressive, evangelical, even intolerant"", but mellow with age and become ""an arm of the industry they are regulating - or senile"". To ignore the danger in 125% mortgages or the City bonus culture showed both industry capture and senility. The first was loan-sharkery, and the second was obscene. So distorting to sound finance are year-end bonuses that they should simply be banned. Those with the responsibility of gambling with other people's savings should do so on salary. While naive Thatcherism may have taken a pasting, there is no reason why capitalism should protest the presence of big government in what is its proper realm. We do not curb state power when the security of the state is at risk. Nor should we do so when the security of the economy is equally jeopardised. The strangest phenomenon these past few days has been the eagerness to enforce ""moral hazard"", a concept regarded by the governor of the Bank of England as a deterrent to risk-taking. This is absurd. The collapse of Enron was no deterrent to Lehman derivative traders. The psychology of money does not work that way. The victims of the credit crunch are not just a few wild traders. They are all participants in the UK economy. I cannot see the sense in letting Northern Rock or Lehman or any other deposit-holding institution go bust just so regulators who have failed in their jobs can seem macho after the event. This is not a question of blowing taxpayers' money on fat cat financiers. I would happily arrest and try all those whose stupidity and greed are about to cause untold hardship to millions - if I could find a law they had broken. Dr Johnson was quite wrong to say a man is ""never more innocently employed than in getting money"". But when a building collapses, you do not kill the architect. You try to get him to build it again. Underpinning financial credit is an absolute function of government and one that has not changed since the birth of capital. It clearly needs constant redefinition. When this saga is through there should be a tribunal of inquiry. Then we can be told what needs mending, and whom to take out and shoot. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com",Simon Jenkins: A tribunal must tell us what to fix.

"By tonight, the governing party should have a new leader. After a painful summer limping along with an unpopular prime minister - who never came close to matching the popularity of his predecessor - the party will today have the leadership contest and the fresh start it has yearned for.  No, that's not a prediction of the imminent fate of Gordon Brown and Labour, but a description of events already under way in Israel. The unpopular PM is Ehud Olmert, who will today be replaced as leader of the ruling Kadima party in a ballot of its 74,000 members. Unless both fail to cross the 40% threshold, either foreign minister Tzipi Livni or former defence minister Shaul Mofaz will be invited to form a coalition and take over as PM.  Polls favour Livni, who, after the failures of Ségolène Royal and Hillary Clinton, might well be the best chance we'll get to see another woman reach the political pinnacle this side of President Palin. Don't count on it, though: Israeli primaries are notoriously difficult to call, determined more by grassroots organisation and unseen horsetrading than by national standing.  The world's diplomats are certainly rooting for Livni, believing that her involvement in the last year of negotiations makes her the best hope for peace between Israelis and Palestinians. She has impressed even her adversaries in those talks, leading a team described as serious and professional: one Palestinian calls Livni a ""master negotiator"".  If she now steps into the top job, that must bode well, bringing the long promised two-state solution within reach, right? Wrong. Conversations with those who have been involved on the diplomatic frontline for more than 15 years, those who have made the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel their life's work, suggest a new despair. With a heavy heart, they are concluding that the two-state solution is dead.  I sat down this week with Shlomo Ben-Ami, Israel's former foreign minister and lead negotiator at the failed peace talks at Camp David in 2000. He would prefer Livni to Mofaz, but he's past believing it will make any great difference. No longer does he think that the effort to reach an agreement with the Palestinians - a project which has endured, on and off, since the Oslo accords of 1993 - depends on having this or that person in charge. The serial failures are not ""technical"", but structural, built into the conflict.  On the Israeli side, the troubles begin with a system designed for paralysis. Under an absurdly pure form of proportional representation, coalitions are inevitable, with small, often extreme parties exerting veto power over larger ones.  What's more, the corruption inquiries that dogged Olmert also hobbled his predecessors. Under Israel's strict legal rules a PM can be indicted for actions taken long before he reached office. ""We have Mediterranean politicians and a Germanic judicial system,"" smiles Ben-Ami. Any leader who inches towards compromise with the Palestinians knows Israel's hawks will be ready to call the police, armed with a file of dirt. Little wonder that not a single illegal outpost on the occupied West Bank, let alone a fully fledged settlement, has been dismantled in the past eight years. ""Politics consistently defeats statesmanship in our system,"" says the former foreign minister.  Things are not much better on the Palestinian side. The nation is split, with Hamas ruling Gaza and Fatah dominant in the West Bank, and it is a truism that Mahmoud Abbas is weak. But it's not just a leadership problem, says one Palestinian negotiator, also a veteran of the campaign for a two-state solution. ""You don't even have a Palestinian national movement,"" he says. The only movement is Islamic: Hamas. Fatah and the PLO are ""hollow shells"". Abbas lacks the national stature of Yasser Arafat; he cannot simply impose his will. Any deal he accepts has at least to come close to the demands of Hamas.  The result is that the two sides are like a pair of acrobats who can stretch every sinew to bend over backwards - but still not touch. As Ben-Ami puts it: ""The Israeli maximum will always fall short of the Palestinian minimum."" But what of the polls that show clear majorities on both sides in favour of two states? These are so-called passive majorities, the sentiment of a public who wouldn't object if an accord came along but won't lift a finger to effect it. Meanwhile, on both sides stand impassioned minorities, whether Jewish settlers or jihadist militants, who will do whatever it takes to thwart the compromise any peace deal would require.  The result is deep gloom among the peacemakers. They search now for a ""new paradigm"". Could that be a single, binational state? ""A nightmare,"" says Ben-Ami, a South Africa situation with no hope of a South Africa solution, given the presence of two national groups equal in number. More unilateral Israeli withdrawals are similarly doomed: after what followed the Israeli pullout from Gaza in 2005 - a Hamas takeover - there would be little support for a similar move in the West Bank.  Instead, there is renewed interest in an old, and once discredited, idea: the Jordanian option. Advocates say Israel would surely feel happier conceding the West Bank to a stable state such as Jordan, than it would to a volatile and split Palestinian movement. Of course, many Palestinians would regard it as a betrayal after decades struggling for independence. But, say the idea's backers, what is more important to Palestinians: a state, or an end to living under occupation? Not so fast, I say - and not only because Jordan's ruling Hashemites might not be too keen to expand the Palestinian majority in their country. I understand the despair of negotiators who have worked in vain for a decade and a half, but I am not ready to give the last rites to the two-state solution just yet. For one thing - as the peacemakers themselves still believe - it remains the most just resolution possible. Both sides would get the self-determination they want, the statehood other nations take for granted. More important, it is, despite everything, still achievable.  Maybe not now, in today's environment. But no context remains static. If Israel's negotiations with Syria were to bear fruit, offering the prospect of a comprehensive settlement between Israel and its neighbours, the cost of the two-state solution might start to look more affordable to the Israeli public. If Hamas were to be ushered in from the cold, joining Fatah, the Palestinian calculus would change too. If there were serious economic incentives, perhaps funded by the Gulf states keen to score diplomatic points in their competition with Iran, that might change it again.  But none of this can wait. It has to be done now. Just because the conflict has gone quiet, with no daily bombs on the evening news, it does not mean it cannot explode into violence once more. And the impact of that rarely stays confined to the region.  What's needed, and with desperate urgency, is pressure from the outside. Not a last-minute effort, such as the one mounted by Bush last November, but a serious, engaged grip from - who else? - a new administration in Washington. That some of the most dedicated and ingenious peacemakers have now given up on the two-state option is surely warning enough. We have one last chance to make it work - before it truly is too late. freedland@theguardian.com",Jonathan Freedland: The two-state solution is nearly dead.

"The feeling is familiar. I had it four years ago and four years before that: a sinking feeling in the stomach. It's a kind of physical pessimism which says: ""It's happening again. The Democrats are about to lose an election they should win - and it could not matter more."" In my head, I'm not as anxious for Barack Obama's chances as I was for John Kerry's in 2004 or Al Gore's in 2000. He is a better candidate than both put together, and all the empirical evidence says this year favours Democrats more than any since 1976. But still, I can't shake off the gloom.  Look at yesterday's opinion polls, which have John McCain either in a dead heat with Obama or narrowly ahead. Given the well-documented tendency of African-American candidates to perform better in polls than in elections - thanks to people who say they will vote for a black man but don't - this suggests Obama is now trailing badly. More troubling was the ABC News-Washington Post survey which found McCain ahead among white women by 53% to 41%. Two weeks ago, Obama had a 15% lead among women. There is only one explanation for that turnaround, and it was not McCain's tranquilliser of a convention speech: Obama's lead has been crushed by the Palin bounce. So you can understand my pessimism. But it's now combined with a rising frustration. I watch as the Democrats stumble, uncertain how to take on Sarah Palin. Fight too hard, and the Republican machine, echoed by the ditto-heads in the conservative commentariat on talk radio and cable TV, will brand Democrats sexist, elitist snobs, patronising a small-town woman. Do nothing, and Palin's rise will continue unchecked, her novelty making even Obama look stale, her star power energising and motivating the Republican base.  So somehow Palin slips out of reach, no revelation - no matter how jaw-dropping or career-ending were it applied to a normal candidate - doing sufficient damage to slow her apparent march to power, dragging the charisma-deprived McCain behind her.  We know one of Palin's first acts as mayor of tiny Wasilla, Alaska was to ask the librarian the procedure for banning books. Oh, but that was a ""rhetorical"" question, says the McCain-Palin campaign. We know Palin is not telling the truth when she says she was against the notorious $400m ""Bridge to Nowhere"" project in Alaska - in fact, she campaigned for it - but she keeps repeating the claim anyway. She denounces the dipping of snouts in the Washington trough - but hired costly lobbyists to make sure Alaska got a bigger helping of federal dollars than any other state.  She claims to be a fiscal conservative, but left Wasilla saddled with debts it had never had before. She even seems to have claimed ""per diem"" allowances - taxpayers' money meant for out-of-town travel - when she was staying in her own house.  Yet somehow none of this is yet leaving a dent. The result is that a politician who conservative blogger Andrew Sullivan calls a ""Christianist"" - seeking to politicise Christianity the way Islamists politicise Islam - could soon be a heartbeat away from the presidency. Remember, this is a woman who once addressed a church congregation, saying of her work as governor - transport, policing and education - ""really all of that stuff doesn't do any good if the people of Alaska's heart isn't right with God"". If Sarah Palin defies the conventional wisdom that says elections are determined by the top of the ticket, and somehow wins this for McCain, what will be the reaction? Yes, blue-state America will go into mourning once again, feeling estranged in its own country. A generation of young Americans - who back Obama in big numbers - will turn cynical, concluding that politics doesn't work after all. And, most depressing, many African-Americans will decide that if even Barack Obama - with all his conspicuous gifts - could not win, then no black man can ever be elected president.  But what of the rest of the world? This is the reaction I fear most. For Obama has stirred an excitement around the globe unmatched by any American politician in living memory. Polling in Germany, France, Britain and Russia shows that Obama would win by whopping majorities, with the pattern repeated in Africa, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. If November 4 were a global ballot, Obama would win it handsomely. If the free world could choose its leader, it would be Barack Obama.  The crowd of 200,000 that rallied to hear him in Berlin in July did so not only because of his charisma, but also because they know he, like the majority of the world's population, opposed the Iraq war. McCain supported it, peddling the lie that Saddam was linked to 9/11. Non-Americans sense that Obama will not ride roughshod over the international system but will treat alliances and global institutions seriously: McCain wants to bypass the United Nations in favour of a US-friendly League of Democracies. McCain might talk a good game on climate change, but a repeated floor chant at the Republican convention was ""Drill, baby, drill!"", as if the solution to global warming were not a radical rethink of the US's entire energy system but more offshore oil rigs.  If Americans choose McCain, they will be turning their back on the rest of the world, choosing to show us four more years of the Bush-Cheney finger. And I predict a deeply unpleasant shift.  Until now, anti-Americanism has been exaggerated and much misunderstood: outside a leftist hardcore, it has mostly been anti-Bushism, opposition to this specific administration. But if McCain wins in November, that might well change. Suddenly Europeans and others will conclude that their dispute is with not only one ruling clique, but Americans themselves. For it will have been the American people, not the politicians, who will have passed up a once-in-a-generation chance for a fresh start - a fresh start the world is yearning for.  And the manner of that decision will matter, too. If it is deemed to have been about race - that Obama was rejected because of his colour - the world's verdict will be harsh. In that circumstance, Slate's Jacob Weisberg wrote recently, international opinion would conclude that ""the United States had its day, but in the end couldn't put its own self-interest ahead of its crazy irrationality over race"". Even if it's not ethnic prejudice, but some other aspect of the culture wars, that proves decisive, the point still holds. For America to make a decision as grave as this one - while the planet boils and with the US fighting two wars - on the trivial basis that a hockey mom is likable and seems down to earth, would be to convey a lack of seriousness, a fleeing from reality, that does indeed suggest a nation in, to quote Weisberg, ""historical decline"". Let's not forget, McCain's campaign manager boasts that this election is ""not about the issues."" Of course I know that even to mention Obama's support around the world is to hurt him. Incredibly, that large Berlin crowd damaged Obama at home, branding him the ""candidate of Europe"" and making him seem less of a patriotic American. But what does that say about today's America, that the world's esteem is now unwanted? If Americans reject Obama, they will be sending the clearest possible message to the rest of us - and, make no mistake, we shall hear it.  · freedland@theguardian.com",Jonathan Freedland: The world's verdict will be harsh if the US rejects the man it yearns for,2008-09-09T23:01:00Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"The sun never sets on the war on terror, even as it degenerates into blood and recrimination. The Woolwich trial of eight members of a supposed 13-member gang all but collapsed on Monday. Despite evidence of intent to blow up an airliner, the jury convicted three defendants of conspiracy to commit murder but failed to reach a verdict on the central allegation.  It has been an open secret in police circles that Operation Overt, the most complex in counter-terror history, was sabotaged by the American vice president, Dick Cheney, desperate for a headline boost to the Republicans' 2006 mid-term elections. British intelligence was following trails and acquiring evidence against 20 suspects. They needed American surveillance help in Pakistan and shared their information, foolishly it now appears, with Washington. The backstory is told in Ron Suskind's new book, The Way of the World. Tony Blair, bursting with news of the operation, discussed it in July 2006 with George Bush, who was impatient for action. The argument, says Suskind, was a classic between American gung ho and British patience. Nobody was sure if the plot was more than half-baked game-playing and it would certainly need evidence to stand up in court. The British were ""treating it all as a criminal matter rather than a historic, and terrorist-glamorising, clash of power and ideology"", Suskind writes. Cheney then privately dispatched the CIA's operations director, Jose Rodriguez, to Islamabad to secure the arrest of one of the British suspects, Rashid Rauf, believed to be a possible link with al-Qaida. The British had been watching him and preparing his extradition. They did not want him rendered useless through CIA or Pakistani torture. Within days, news of Rauf's capture reached the British plotters. In a panic, the police had desperately to round up as many suspects as they could find overnight. According to Suskind, ""top officials in British intelligence cursed, threw ashtrays and screamed bloody murder"". Months of work, which might have unpicked an entire al-Qaida network back to the Pakistani training camps, was ruined by ""forced, foolish hastiness"" - and all for the mid-term elections. Bush was soon boasting of having ""foiled a plot to blow up passenger planes headed for the United States"". Two years later, a British jury, having to decide on the basis of evidence whether it faced another 9/11 or just a bunch of crazies, gave the benefit of the doubt to the latter. It was clearly fed up with scare stories and the politics of fear and felt the police had not made a case. Today, many of the plotters are at large, and Rauf himself has mysteriously escaped custody. This is what happens when criminal conspiracy is redefined as an act of war. It goes political. As a conspiracy to cause mayhem, the suspected airline plotters merited and were getting thorough detective work in what was clearly a superb operation. Because it was also a ""war"", the death-or-glory boys took over and wrecked it. Worse than wreck it, they rendered the operation counter-productive. A few sad, disaffected and clearly dangerous youths were captured, but in such a way as to induce many more to sympathise and imitate them. They will be fired by the same resentment at British foreign policy that has turned a crusade to bring democracy to the heathen into a bloody and drawn-out meddling in the affairs of foreign states. That meddling is now overwhelmingly counter-productive, fuelling anti-western insurgency across an arc from Syria through Iraq and Afghanistan to Pakistan. Characterised everywhere as a war on terror, it is further politicised and polarised. Last week's massive operation by Nato forces to move a dam turbine 100 miles across Helmand was reportedly brought forward at Washington's insistence to help John McCain's candidacy. It cost some 300 Afghan lives. Every one of those lives invites revenge against that dam. Meanwhile, Nato and the Americans are intensifying their bombing of Afghan and Waziri villages. Anyone who visits this theatre is briefed with the same mantra: We are going to stop killing civilians ... Every death is 10 recruits to the enemy ... We must win on the ground not from the air. Airforces claim they can kill with ""pinpoint accuracy"". They claim the new predator drones can murder a Taliban leader at a mile distant. They lie. To soldiers on the ground, calling in air power to clear a village is easier and safer than fighting by hand. As a result, and amid a storm of mendacious denials, wedding parties are blown to pieces, houses are crushed, women and children are massacred. To kill a Taliban it is considered worth wiping out a market. British and American generals in Kabul have slid into Vietnam mode, using the enemy kill rate as an indicator of victory. They do not care that one dead Taliban creates 10 live ones. An Afghan crusade that was possibly winnable in 2001 has been systematically subverted by those waging it. Attempts to destroy the nation's staple crop, opium, has alienated almost everyone and driven huge profits into the pockets of the enemy. It has been unbelievably stupid. The current use of drones to bomb Pakistani territory, usually on faulty or devious intelligence, is raising whole tribes to fury. It now risks driving an unstable Islamabad regime back into covert, if not overt, support for the Taliban, as in the 1990s. Is this really the intention of Washington and London? The war on terror has become an exercise in cynicism, a backdrop to domestic politics. Terrorists are a menace to certain western cities. A generation of young Muslims has emerged who see glory in killing civilians for nothing but publicity. They appear loosely aligned with insurgent forces in Pakistan and Afghanistan, much as terrorists in the 1970s and 80s allied themselves with Palestinians. But these terrorists do not constitute a threat to the security of any western state. Their plots and outrages are crimes and do not merit the status of war. They have become servants of political rhetoric. To be tough on terrorism is apparently akin to shooting a moose. That Nato soldiers can casually bomb civilians in these distant parts, knowing it to be counter-productive, shows the half-heartedness of this so-called war.

"The struggle continues. This afternoon's business at the TUC tumbled through rural social exclusion, child poverty, a hair-raising call for the revival of the British coal industry, and an equally terrifying session about abused and vulnerable workers. Before all that, though, there was an hour or so focused on the state of the economy, and plenty of irate calls to arms. One delegate enthused about the benefits of nationalisation; another claimed that ""New Labour has reached the end of the line as far as privatisation and markets are concerned""; yet another reckoned that ""capitalism can seriously damage your welfare."" In support of an amendment – passed, as it happens – advocating the state ownership of ""utilities and services including water, gas, electricity, oil and the transport sector"", a fella from the dependably militant RMT at least had the good sense to cut to the quick: ""We want to go back to how it was before 1979,"" he said, to enthusiastic claps. Two hours later, Alistair Darling took his seat on the platform, and the realisation once again hit home. No matter that as business transfers its munificence to the Conservative party, 92% of the ""people's party's"" funding currently comes from the unions – when it comes to the big stuff, they are from Mars, while the government hails from Venus (or, as possibly evidenced by Darling's impossibly measured, joke-free schtick, Vulcan). Advance copies of his speech came in the bizarre form of 139 numbered paragraphs. They contained endless mentions of the word ""stability"", the usual claims that letting public-sector pay keep pace with prices would somehow ""entrench"" inflation, and three repetitions of an ungrammatical mantra that we will presumably soon be heartily sick of: ""Times are tough, but we'll get through it."" In the case of those poor souls contemplating insane fuel bills and facing the choice of whether – as a TUC buzz-phrase would have it – to ""heat or eat"", the words will surely land just this side of being hopelessly crass. Oh, and while we're on the subject: Darling predictably nailed down the government's refusal to go for a windfall tax on the energy companies, and stuck to the idea that the best means by which to tackle fuel poverty lie in lagging the loft and cavity wall insulation.  His brief Q&A with delegates was testy but uneventful; his innate talent for closing down the possibility of any highly-charged debate via a benign kind of tedium was present and correct. But wait: at sentence number 77, we hit upon a possible revelation, which will doubtless be torn apart by sceptical Cifers, and doesn't quite fill me with visions of a re-energised government, but merits some serious attention. From the top, then (in the wake of yet another tribute to the wonders of ""stability""):  ""77. And that's why pay matters right across the board – in the private and the public sector – in the boardroom as much as on the shopfloor. 78. You're rightly concerned about excessive bonuses – especially when people seem to get money for failing, not succeeding. And that's got to change. 79. A bonus should be for hard work, not big mistakes. 80. Excessive bonuses, which encourage traders to take excessive risks, at a time of easy global credit – one of the major reasons for the global credit crunch. 81. We need to learn the lessons to prevent this happening again.""  In response to which, there was a smattering of muted gasps from the media corner, and quickfire conversations about whether anyone in the cabinet had uttered such heresies before. They haven't: this is a sharp departure from the kind of fawning nonsense dispensed by John Hutton, possibly to be reprised by the blighted Mr Brown when he makes that supposedly make-or-break speech in Manchester. But what does it amount to? Cant? Lip service? Too little, far too late? A quiet promise of the kind of legislative action already taking shape in Europe? On the last score, I wouldn't bet on it. There again, while the storm-the-winter-palace stuff still bouncing around the conference floor wouldn't allow for such cautious counter-measures, this is an interesting(ish) step. But enough to mend a relationship seemingly heading for the rocks and adding to the Brown government's sense of irreversible doom? Somehow, I doubt it.","John Harris: Oh, Darling, you weren't wonderful",2008-09-09T18:29:05Z,John Harris,politics
"A race that began as the West Wing now looks alarmingly like Desperate Housewives. Six months ago, you couldn't help but notice the striking similarity between Barack Obama and Matthew Santos, the fictional but charismatic ethnic minority candidate who promised to heal America's divide. Now, you can't help but feel you're watching an especially lurid episode from Wisteria Lane, as the real-life Sarah Palin fends off rumours of a fake pregnancy - and the accusation that her son is actually her grandson - by revealing that her unmarried 17-year-old daughter is expecting a baby and will soon marry the father, a young hockey player. Meanwhile, Palin has hired a lawyer to beat back a state investigation into claims that she abused the power of her office to remove her sister's ex-husband from his job as a state trooper, a man who has admitted tasering his own 10-year-old stepson! Would even America's trashiest daytime soaps dare squeeze that much action into just the first four days of a new storyline? The McCain campaign has done it, thereby achieving in an instant one of its key objectives. At last people are talking about the Republicans, after months in which all the excitement had been on the other side. Ever since McCain introduced Palin to a stunned, unprepared political world last Friday, Obama has barely had a look-in. From conservative talk radio to celebrity gossip websites, there is only one topic: it's all Palin, all the time. In these reams of commentary, there is uncertainty about the only question that really matters: how will this saga, and Palin herself, play in the November election? Ultimately, will she hurt or hinder John McCain? If it's hard to tell, that's because almost every new nugget we discover about Governor Palin can be viewed in radically opposite lights. The ""family values"" brigade might be shocked by the admission of premarital sex in the Palin clan; or it might be heartened that young Bristol - even the names sound like they come from a TV soap - has chosen to carry her baby to term and marry the father. So far, the latter reaction seems to have prevailed, with the Christian right, already smitten by Palin's anti-abortion, pro-guns, anti-gay marriage stances, standing by its woman. Some McCain backers have even tried to turn the episode into a net positive: talkshow host Michael Graham wrote yesterday that Palin, with one son off to Iraq, another with Down's syndrome and now a daughter set to become a teenage mom, had undergone experiences that millions of American women could relate to: ""Sarah Palin is as accessible as Obama is exotic.""  Or take what was, until the soap suds started lathering up, Palin's most obvious weakness: her inexperience. To political veterans, it's ludicrous to propose that a 20-month governor of a state with a population of under 700,000 is ready to take over as president (not such a remote possibility, given that John McCain is 72 and has a history of cancer). They note that when Palin visited Kuwait last year, she reportedly had to apply for a passport: she had never travelled outside North America before. How could she possibly be ready to lead the world's greatest military power?  But Democrats who make these points risk doing the Republicans' work for them, falling into the wearily familiar trap of sounding like condescending coastal elitists, who look down their noses at ordinary Americans like the Palins. The blue-collar Republican base is already wild for the governor: every time they see a New York talking head say how absurd her candidacy is, they'll like her even more.  Besides, the McCain camp is already hard at work spinning that all this inexperience is a good thing. It means, they say, that Palin will be a ""breath of fresh Alaska air"" in stale Washington, an outsider who had already dared take on politics-as-usual in her own state. Viewed that way, Palin has restored to McCain what always used to be his USP: his status as the reformer, fearlessly standing against the machine.  So she will go into the vice-presidential TV debate against the seasoned senator and foreign policy sage Joe Biden cushioned by subterraneanly low expectations. If she manages to utter several coherent sentences in a row, it will be declared a draw. If he so much as looks patronising or if he does an Al Gore-style sigh of impatience, she will be declared the winner. He's a bruiser who would have been eager to crush any male opponent. Now he'll be holding himself back lest he looks like a sexist pig.  There are some straightforward negatives for Palin that are not susceptible to even the most energetic spin. It's not good that she turns out to have been for the notorious ""bridge to nowhere"" - a $400m project in Alaska that has come to symbolise wasteful, ""pork-barrel"" spending - before she was against it. It dents her image as a reformer and shows she flip-flops as much as any other politician. Not helpful, either, that in the 1990s she was a member of the Alaskan Independence party, which seeks a referendum on breaking away from the US. The firing of her brother-in-law, and the outstanding request that she give a deposition on the matter, under oath, will linger through the campaign. And the fact that the McCain camp seems to have started seriously vetting Palin after nominating her, only now sending lawyers and researchers to Alaska, reflects especially badly on McCain himself. (He met her properly for the first time last week, according to the New York Times.) It suggests the downside of all that maverick brio is a recklessness that is hardly suitable in a commander-in-chief.  What no one can know is whether that cost will be outweighed by the gains Palin brings, galvanising a socially conservative base that had been previously lukewarm towards McCain. What we can know already is that this election will share a depressing feature with the contests of the past 40 years: that America will plunge again into the never-ending culture wars.  For Palin cannot help but polarise the electorate. Everything that liberal, blue-state America can't stand about her makes conservative, red-state America swoon. It's not just about ""Jesus babies and guns,"" as Rush Limbaugh pithily put it. Palin also wants ""intelligent design"" - creationism - taught in school. When she was mayor of the small town of Wasilla, ""she asked the library how she could go about banning books,"" according to a local official quoted by Time. Palin was worried about ""inappropriate"" language. ""The librarian was aghast"" - and was later threatened with the sack.  In his stirring speech last week, Obama urged America not to ""make a big election about small things"". Yet here we are, discussing not Sarah Palin's record or programme but Jesus, guns, and as one feminist blogger put it yesterday, ""the uterine activity of her family"". This is a setback for women, especially in a year that seemed to promise a breakthrough, but it is also a setback for America itself.  Obama made his name four years ago with a speech that called for an end to the civil war of red against blue. In 2008, he urged a different kind of election, one that would match the gravity of the hour. But the naming of Sarah Palin, and the reaction it has provoked, has dashed that hope. Americans are, once again, fighting over the questions that politics can never really settle - faith, sexuality - and pushing aside the ones that it can. And which it must.  freedland@theguardian.com",Jonathan Freedland: Who knows if Palin will bring victory or defeat? But the culture wars are back,2008-09-02T23:01:00Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"I am assuming as are the police, and because all reason points to the same, that Christopher Foster killed his family, himself, and set fire to their home in Maesbrook, Shropshire. As police exhumed the body of a 15-year-old girl so unsuspecting of her father's lunacy that it seems she was chatting on the internet just before he shot her, it was extraordinary to notice where and how the nation's immediate sympathy was parcelled out.  Typically, there is a lot of focus on the horses, the four dogs, the ducks, the chickens, the guinea pigs, all shot, police believe, after Foster's wife and daughter, then incinerated with the family. The British suffer a lot of unflattering comparisons with the rest of Europe, indeed, the rest of humanity, but our love of animals, above all other things, really marks us out as peculiar to the point of a mass personality disorder.  I'm as guilty as anyone of this. When police found the dogs and horses, but had yet to announce they'd been shot before the fire, I did have a moment of nauseating pity that I never get for the human victims of tragedies. There's no excuse for this. It's not just a strange national quirk, it's an active rejection of sophistication, an indulgent wallowing in a lesser tragedy so we can pretend to be sympathetic creatures without ever having to wrestle with meaningful emotional consequence. By concentrating on the dogs and horses, we don't even have to admit the slight frisson that draws people to bad news in the first place: the relief that it's them, not you; that furthermore, having happened to them, it is in some (statistically fallacious) way less likely to happen to you. Never mind all that - poor pets! Imagine how confused they must have been! Seriously, if this were just me, I would just have a word with myself. I am having a word with myself. But given the tabloid coverage (where else in the world would anyone have even mentioned the guinea pigs?), I am guessing that it's not just me. More to the point, though, there is something savage and strange about the way men are presented when they destroy their own and all these other lives for something as petty as a money worry. We have just about, as a society, come to see as aberrant and wrong those men who kill their children in an act of vengeance on their wives - there was a time, not even that long ago, when such an event would have been portrayed as a simple, no-fault tragedy, the children as innocent, big-eyed victims, not of a murderous father, but of a messy divorce.  We persist, though, in seeing a certain nobility in the man who destroys everything to avoid ""shame"". Sure, he must have been crazy, but in a nice way. He has his priorities the wrong way round, but that doesn't mean he didn't treasure these lives that he took possession of so freely. As the Sun (or rather, ""a source"") said of Foster: ""In the end his state of mind must have been, 'If I can't have all this, nobody will'. He adored his wife and daughter so he must have been in a terrible mental state to do what he did.""  It makes no sense, this stuff: to talk in one sentence of a dog-in-the-manger motivation so idiotic and immature you'd balk at it from a toddler; and then in the next breath to attribute an emotion as deep and encompassing as adoration to this petulant, wanton, arrogant man-child. Other newspapers have scented the act with an Egyptian grandeur, as Foster interred himself, pharaoh-like, with all his ""belongings"", his wife and pets and offspring, in the rustic tomb that was so soon to be repossessed.  It's ludicrous, and outrageous, that he should be invested with such dignity. When a teenage thug knifes a grandmother for a wallet full of buttons and coppers, we all agree what a poisonous creature he is, what a failed human being, what a depressing waste of a life for such meaningless booty. And yet, when a businessman chokes out his entire family just to avoid the bailiffs, surely that's worse? Surely it's more depressing to lose people to a concept as small-time and curtain-twitchy as public humiliation? Why have all the reports given Foster such a pass, when newspapers are normally so free with their condemnation? A few reasons: first, there is a residual, tacit sense that the head of the family has to butcher the whole lot because it would have been worse to kill himself and leave them unprotected. Furthermore, there is an assumption that, since the man is engine, the epicentre of the family, he feels everything most strongly, and nobody else's feelings, let alone censure from outsiders, can match the hell he will have put himself through. There is, again tacitly, an understanding that when you're dealing with large sums of money - a house worth more than £1m, debts of more than £2m - then the players are somehow more noteworthy and noble than people who kill one another for 25 quid. This is all total, throwback bilge. If anything, the snobbery is more offensive than the sexism, but it's a close-run thing. There is nothing laudable or lofty about any of this. It is just another worm playing God; it's just another murder. mszoewilliams@yahoo.co.uk","Zoe Williams: Pity the family, the horses if we must.

"What kind of relationship did Tony Blair have with fruit? From Peter Stothard, who shadowed Blair for his book 30 Days, we learned much about its vital role in the approach to the Iraq war. ""Tony Blair looks down at the fruit bowl, takes a green apple and chews it very slowly."" And David Cameron? What characterises his fruit-eating style? We are obliged to Dylan Jones, who spent a year following the Tory leader around for Cameron on Cameron, for evidence of a revealing difference between his approach and that of the last Labour leader. ""As he quickly munched his way through a banana and then an apple,"" Jones noted, as Cameron prepared for PMQs last year, ""the traffic thundered down the Embankment ... "" It's the little details that are so telling, isn't it? That, at least, is the principle behind fly-on-the-wall books in which a journalist is given privileged access to a politician, for much of which - since one cannot be asking questions all the time - the fly simply observes what the politician does, in order, as Jones puts it, ""to get to the very heart of what makes him tick"". More blessed even than Stothard, Jones spent a whole year as a fly, during which, excitingly for him, Cameron went from being written off as the latest Tory leadership embarrassment to being hailed as prime minister in waiting. But anyone wondering how much this extraordinary transformation is due to Cameron's talents, and how much he owes to the successive failures of Gordon Brown, would be advised to wait for a different book. This is partly Cameron's fault, since, in 2007 when he agreed to this experiment, it was plainly his intention to reveal nothing to Jones that was not already obvious or guessable from his extensive public appearances. It says much, in fact, for the man's prodigious self-confidence that, even at this early and unglamorous stage in his career, he anticipated public interest in more than 300 pages of Cameron trivia, table-talk, and non-personal personal habits: ""I've got digital radio,"" he volunteers, ""and they're incredibly easy to turn to stations and get wonderful reception ... ""  Of course, Jones is more culpable for writing it down. Even if expectations of a fly on a wall are invariably low, since the insect in question will have been thoroughly vetted for loyalty and discretion, Jones compounds this inherent unreliability by being, as soon becomes evident, a hopelessly devoted groupie. More than insights, revelations and policy detail, Jones simply wants Cameron to love him back.  ""I think you acquitted yourself very well on Jonathan Ross,"" wheedles this most besotted of bluebottles; ""You're very powerful when you are speaking in the House;"" ""You seem more confident than you've ever been."" Not that this torrent of unconditional smarm makes the book valueless. Any journalist who has ever wondered, after some futile set-to, whether flattery might not elicit more revealing answers from a politician than interrogation will find the question decisively answered in Cameron on Cameron. ""One thing that the public admired you for,"" Jones oozes, on the subject of Derek Conway, ""was the swiftness with which you dealt with irregularities ... "" When Cameron, instead of blushing, just swats him away - ""I don't do these things on a whim"" - Jones sounds desperate: ""It was meant to be a compliment!"" ""Well, good,"" Cameron allows, with an unmistakeable air of, ""don't let it happen again"".  If there is any theme unifying this offputting heap of old Q&As, stale opinion polls, picked-over cuttings and unilluminating detail, it is a kind of doomed non-buddy story, not so much Sideways as Completely Tangential, replete with unshared references, crushed pleasantries and whatever is the opposite of banter - retnab? To begin with, one's sympathies are all with Cameron, as Jones, who has turned to the right in middle age (think of him as Alf Garnett trapped inside a metrosexual body) unctuously comes on to him in cars, trains, prisons - really, some of the most inappropriate places - seeking evidence of a brotherly bond. ""Have you seen the film Children of Men with Clive Owen?"" he pleads, not pausing for his cornered quarry to answer. ""It's set twenty-odd years in the future ... "" For Jones, even if he is always going to be beta double minus to Cameron's alpha male, there must have seemed reason to hope: even if they'd watched different films, the GQ executive and the quondam TV PR speak the same, watercooler patois, featuring ""long tails"" and ""big asks"". Gradually, however, Cameron's ungenerous stock responses awaken a twitch or two of sympathy for his hapless fan. Lacking both the will and the journalistic equipment to respond to yawnsome blandness with renewed demands for clarification (how, for crying out loud, will a Cameron government enforce the end of ""top-down state control""?), Jones the style writer retreats, under stress, to doing what he does best: spotting brands. ""There was the white perforated kitchen roll"", he records, in a desperate, extended description of the Cameron kitchen, ""the John Lewis kettle, the Bodum cafetiere, the Fairy Liquid, the sticky jars of Marmite, the Waitrose marmalade and the plastic jars of sea salt."" Someone else will have to ask Cameron, the author and object of this dull, faintly insulting PR exercise, if he thinks it benefited his own brand. Is it possible that his behaviour never departs, as this account suggests, from being a study in conscious, utterly businesslike composure? And if it did, could we rely on Jones, Cameron's bizarre choice of Boswell, ever to tell us? It's hard, in the end, to decide which of the two comes across as more untrustworthy.",Review: Cameron on Cameron by David Cameron and Dylan Jones,2008-08-29T23:01:00Z,Catherine Bennett,review
"The funny hat - usually stars and stripes, often involving glitter - is one tradition of the American political convention that has not faded. Plenty are on display here at the Democrats' gathering, but one in particular caught my eye. It was studded with badges from previous campaigns: there, frozen in time, were the smiling, hopeful faces of a succession of Democratic nominees for president, all the way back to 1968. Trouble is, with only two exceptions, every one of those men failed to reach the White House: Kerry, Gore, Dukakis, Mondale, McGovern, Humphrey - the woman's hat was a roll-call of losers. She might as well have worn a giant L on her head. The current worry of many Democrats, who once thought Denver would be a celebration en route to a coronation, is that Barack Obama could be about to join that uncelebrated company. Polls show the race with John McCain locked in a dead heat, Obama's lead eroded to zero. The question delegates and bigwigs are asking each other in the hotel lobbies and on the shuttle buses is: ""Why aren't we ahead?"" They all know the landscape has rarely looked more favourable to their party. A Republican president is the most consistently unpopular since records began. Nearly 80% of Americans say their country is heading in the wrong direction. The economy is tanking and US soldiers are still dying in an unpopular war. As the California strategist Bob Mulholland told me, straining to be heard over the convention house band: ""If George W Bush was seeking re-election, we'd be 20 points ahead."" But he's not. Nor is McCain an incumbent vice-president tarred by the record of the outgoing administration. Instead, he can pose as a maverick who more than once has challenged Bush. That's one possible explanation for Obama's failure to pull ahead, but Democrats have no shortage of others. Some blame Obama's recent vacation in Hawaii, leaving the playing field to McCain: while Obama was on the beach, the Georgia crisis erupted, allowing the Republican to pose as the seasoned foreign policy sage. Others say the Democrat is still hobbled by the Clinton psychodrama, which has been dominating yet again in Denver. Disunity stories have been treading on the Obama message, as the Clintons keep grumbling that, like a mafia clan, they are not being shown enough respect. What should be Barack's week is still filled with Bill and Hillary. (It was surely an error to give them two evenings - last night to her, tonight to him - rather than bundling them together and out of the way in a single session.) One poll this week found less than half of Hillary's former supporters in the primaries are ready to vote for Obama; one in four plan to vote for McCain. And most Democrats suggest, once safely off the record, that a key factor is, depressingly, race. If Obama were white, they say, this contest would be over. ""When will South Africa elect a white president?"" whispered one party official, fretting that America might not be ready to put a black man in the White House. But the simplest explanation, one that touches on all of the above, is that McCain has fought an aggressively negative campaign these past few weeks - and it's working. Its twin themes are clear and simple: Obama is inexperienced and not ready to be president; and he is a ""celebrity"", out of touch with the lives of ordinary Americans. The attack on inexperience is wholly predictable: it's the flipside of Obama's presentation of himself as an untainted outsider and agent of change. It's legitimate too, since Obama would indeed have the shortest resumé of any president in a century. But the ""celebrity"" attack is another matter entirely. For this is just a new word for an old message: that Obama is an elitist, remote from real America. And it truly is an old message. The Republicans have been aiming this missile at Democrats for more than 50 years. So John Kerry was vaguely French and liked windsurfing: not a real American. Al Gore was the son of a senator and ""grew up in a hotel room in Washington"": not a real American. Michael Dukakis had a funny name and looked weird in a tank: not a real American. Again and again they do it and with breathtaking chutzpah. Who was it calling Gore and Kerry sons of privilege? Why it was George Walker Bush, the son of a president. Who now tries to pretend that the Obamas are rarefied snobs with no feel for the way most Americans live? That would be John McCain, who, when asked last week how many houses he owned, hesitated, before telling the reporter his staff would get back to him. (The answer was seven.) McCain's wife, Cindy, meanwhile, once said of her home state: ""In Arizona, the only way to get around is by small private plane."" What complicates matters is that it's not solely about economics. The Republicans say Democrats are out of touch not just because they might be wealthy - though it helps Obama that his running mate, Joe Biden, is the poorest member of the senate with a negative net worth - but for failing to match up to a whole set of more nebulous, cultural criteria. Crudely put, Democrats are deemed elitist if they would look out of place at a Nascar rally (a stock car race); if they don't listen to country music; if they can't chug beer from a bottle or clear brush on a ranch. Would be First Ladies meanwhile have a different set of boxes to tick: they have to prove they are ""non-threatening"", that their careers are less important to them than their roles as wives and mothers, that they are gentle and free of spiky edges. (This was Michelle Obama's task on Monday and she fulfilled it quite brilliantly.) The US media go along with all this. There is a starting assumption that Republicans are, by definition, solid, patriotic all-Americans. It is Democrats who have to prove themselves. Thus the press recycle endlessly Obama's reference to the price of arugula - but almost never mention Cindy McCain's preference for the private jet. Worse still, Democrats seem to have internalised this assumption about themselves and their opponents. Democratic congressman Ed Markey told Time that Obama's first task is to prove he is ""one of us"". Is there any Republican of whom he would ask that question? Democrats can choose one of two ways to fight this problem. The first is to do their best to fit the right's definition of a real American, either by nominating southern, down-home males (like the Bill Clinton of 1992) or by somehow trying to squeeze into that box: picking a working-class bruiser like Biden, having Michelle Obama declare her childhood passion for the Brady Bunch. Or Democrats can simply refuse to fight on these Republican terms. That is what Obama did when he burst into the national consciousness at the 2004 convention, declaring that the culture war of red states and blue states had gone on too long. ""We coach little league in the blue states and have gay friends in the red states,"" he declared, so insisting on the legitimacy of all Americans. Restating that message is surely part of his task when he accepts his nomination before a stadium crowd of 70,000 tomorrow. He needs to change the terms of trade in this election, to reframe it so that he's no longer answering, ""Is he one of us?"" - but persuading his fellow Americans that it's time, at long last, to put that question behind them.freedland@theguardian.com",Jonathan Freedland: Obama will struggle to win as the real American.

"After two weeks which abounded with unforgettable moments of surpassing joy, one event still stands out. How long has it been since any of us witnessed a reversal of British mediocrity on this inspirational scale? To hear John Major introduced on the Today programme as 'the father of the lottery' (presumably because anyone under 12 refuses to believe he could ever, really, have been allowed into Downing Street), and thus the author of our Olympic triumphs, was yet another golden moment when you appreciated how much this country has changed since benighted, medal-starved 1996. All credit, too, to the BBC for reminding us, with this otherwise mystifying tribute to the father of the cones hotline, that the money which goes to create Britain's new sporting elite is largely generated by the gallant members of Team Lottery, most of whom are unlikely, given their doomed attachment to luck, ever to develop the kind of willpower that is acclaimed in successful athletes.  It is difficult anyway to imagine these selfless gamblers pausing between games of a Dream Number ('play online every day until 11pm'), to reflect Adlington-style that regular betting 'is worth it, all the pain and the hardship and worrying if you are as good as you think you are'. 'Yes, well, the Gradgrinds never did like the lottery from the start,' chuckled Sir John, (alluding, of course, to the schoolmaster in Dickens, who callously bans his charges from playing lotto on their mobiles). With his sporting legacy finally confirmed for the history books, the father of the Weekly Grand Scratchcard was disinclined to crow over lottery spoilsports whose embarrassment can only have deepened - assuming they are remotely patriotic - with every British addition to the Beijing medals tally. 'They must be pretty sad people, that's what I say,' he said, genially. 'I mean, have a look at the sheer joy there is up and down this country.' On examination, Britain has indeed evinced all the standard symptoms of non-football-related sporting euphoria, from the enormous TV viewing figures and tearful hallucinations of the sort last witnessed after the rugby in 2003; to anti-Australian outbursts and tasteless allusions to our historic martial spirit. If such peaks of collective ecstasy could be achieved more cheaply, as some Gradgrinds suggest, by doses of Nice-approved chemical stimulants, it seems unlikely that any artificially induced high would feature the jingoism and xenophobic gloating that currently combine in a mood one expert has depicted, not wishing to exaggerate, as 'the greatest demonstration of national joy than at any time since the night of victory in Europe in 1945'. How long will this rejoicing last? Although past triumphs indicate that the most intensely pleasurable sensations will have faded by next Thursday, there are hopes, in Downing Street at least, that with honours ceremonies and repeated reminders, a quieter form of post-Beijing contentment could last into the winter months, thus balancing the coming epidemic of hypothermia and reassuring lottery players that their next £320m will be money well spent. Of more value, however, to Olympic officials, when they demand a fresh tranche of public money for boats, horses and Australian coaches, will be a growing eagerness among more prominent figures to participate in what George Orwell once disparaged as 'this modern cult of sport'. Come to think of it, for the first time I can remember, it is unfashionable to quote Orwell, whose disappointing views on games must now be seen in their historical context. Yes, of course he deplored in 'The Sporting Spirit' the way nations 'work themselves into furies over these absurd contests, and seriously believe - at any rate for short periods - that running, jumping and kicking a ball are tests of national virtue'. But you have to remember that this was before the arrival of Lycra, beach volleyball, and a purity of contest that is guaranteed by the ceaseless testing of gallons of Olympian urine. If he were alive today to experience, like us, the joy of winning, maybe Orwell would repudiate his sourer comments ('Sport is an unfailing cause of ill-will'; 'Serious sport has nothing to do with fair play') and endorse, instead, British columnists who have discovered that all those dictators and communists were right: amateurism is for losers; we don't do silver; every medal is a victory for our nation. As the golds have multiplied, it has been proposed that winning at sport can also - depending which expert you believe - restore national pride, reverse Scottish devolution, trounce political correctness, promote elitism, exalt women, justify private schools, banish obesity, revive the public's trust in public spending and glue society back together again (assuming it was broken in the first place). Following close study of his television, the mayor of London finds that the respect agenda is based on a myth of juvenile dysfunction bearing no relation to the exemplary 'courage and morals' seen in Beijing. While the Olympics have been on TV, reports of young sociopaths stabbing one another to death have, it is true, diminished in much the same encouraging way as stories about human rights abuses in China. Even if the Games are too infrequent to be a realistic alternative to tagging, there may well exist, among these troubled young Britons, a level of passive sportsmanship that could one day be channelled into wholesome activity. Particularly if the 2012 organisers follow up their forward-looking, graffiti-style logo with innovative sports which enable the Games (as Baron de Coubertin always wanted) to move with the times. Many of our inner-city youngsters might excel, for instance, at a new, street-inspired form of freestyle fencing, using shorter, less blunt versions of the epee. Or would they do better in yachting or equestrianism? With money following medals, and vice versa, the first rule for any idealistic young sportsman or woman must be to resist any impulsive commitment to an activity where there is a high probability of failure. Only now, witnessing record-breaking achievements in sporting hyperbole, does one really appreciate the restraint shown by commentators in 1996, when Britain's solitary gold in Atlanta must have pointed to a state of national degradation, mental as well as physical. It turned out, however, that the answer to Olympic shame was not moral renewal, or even more games lessons in schools, but Olympic money, spent on an Olympic elite. As the father of the lottery reminded us last week, a gold medal is a commodity like any other, and the price just keeps going up. 'Money is the root of all progress,' was Sir John's sporting adaptation of the new testament, 'and it needs to be continuing.' Why need it be? Would we have asked the East Germans that question? Do we now ask the Chinese? The Russians? 'Our challenge,' said Gordon Brown - and one hopes our comrade lottery players were listening - 'is to turn what has been two weeks of great sporting success into 10 years of sporting triumph for our country.' Perhaps his time has come.","Catherine Bennett: After Olympic euphoria, normal service will be resumed",2008-08-23T23:01:00Z,Catherine Bennett,politics
"Well, the clue was in the title, really: Cameron on Cameron. Or one of the most image-aware politicians in the world presents himself as he would most like to be seen. This book doesn't promise thrilling revelations and it doggedly doesn't deliver them. Blandly readable as it is, there is a great big hole in it and it's David Cameron-shaped. Many people buying Dylan Jones's book will be expecting something like the brilliantly subversive political interviews in GQ, the magazine Jones edits, which often skewer something telling about their subjects, most recently, Nick Clegg's unwise admission to having had 'not more than 30' lovers. This book, Jones promises in his preface, will similarly get to 'the very heart of what makes him [Cameron] tick'. And so for nearly a year, its author followed Cameron, talking to him once a fortnight. He probably had more time, one on one, with the Conservative leader than any other journalist during a truly momentous period of metamorphosis, from last autumn's busted flush to this summer's heir apparent. As Jones and his editors recognised, real understanding of this phenomenon was overdue. Yet the overwhelming feeling Jones's book delivers is: is this it? His David Cameron likes watching Midsomer Murders; he eats Pot Noodles; he thought the best bit of university was 'sitting around drinking and chatting'. Here he is revealing all about his childhood: 'I had a very happy family home, sitting around the supper table and talking about everything and being very close.' The biggest hurdle he overcame, apparently, was having an older brother.  Jones quotes Michael Portillo saying approvingly that Cameron is not as nice as he looks, but seems to have unearthed no evidence of this. We get a loving inventory of the contents of the Camerons' kitchen - 'the white perforated kitchen roll, the John Lewis kettle, the Bodum cafetière, the Fairy Liquid' - instead of the contents of Cameron's psyche. The theme is Cameron's relentless ordinariness, when what we need to know is what makes him extraordinary. So did Jones, whose questions are often considerably longer than Cameron's answers, not dig hard enough? Was he too cosy with his subject? Invited to watch Cameron preparing for Prime Minister's questions, the author helpfully volunteers the details of that just-conducted Clegg interview, as if he were a part of the team. Is Cameron honestly just this bland? Or is he already so alarmingly good at sliding around questions that he is impossible - even given a year - to nail? To some extent, the book reflects the man himself, charmingly frank about things that actually matter little in a Prime Minister - how he tackles his children being naughty or arguments with his wife Samantha - and vague about what matters a lot, like tax policy. Yet amid the banalities, padded out by contextualising chapters mostly generated from newspaper cuttings, there are frustrating flashes of something more.  The chapter on Cameron's severely disabled son Ivan mostly covers familiar ground, yet bowled a sentimental question by Jones - 'You must think about him all day long' - Cameron declines to take the easy way out. He retorts: 'No, I don't. I love him dearly, but we've definitely managed to get to a situation where he has not taken over our lives. The parents of disabled children are not necessarily angels. They didn't ask for this to happen.'  It is an admirably honest answer, providing a fleeting glimpse of the courage and the coolness Cameron must have possessed to beat the more aggressively ambitious David Davis to the Tory leadership. It's the quality Portillo saw: it makes a leader capable of sacking a friend, facing down a mutinous party, sending soldiers to war.  There is a second tiny slip when Cameron reveals that 'the security people' have told him he cannot keep riding his bike if he becomes Prime Minister. Interestingly, the man who fiercely rebukes his MPs for suggesting victory is in the bag has already discussed his security if and when he's in Number 10. But mostly, this is a missed opportunity. It is an interesting idea to present a politician unmediated for once, his words speaking for themselves, but Cameron is too sharp to give much away in this format, so you end up longing for some rigorous analysis.  Jones suggests this book is for ordinary people intrigued by Cameron, not political hacks. But do they really want to know about his stance on Turkey joining the EU, dutifully covered alongside the domestic minutiae? Francis Elliott and James Hanning's readable biography of Cameron gives juicier gossip, while Peter Stothard's 30 Days, a fly-on-the-wall study of Tony Blair at war, is a better peep behind closed Westminster doors. This is an elegantly hollow book; better hope the hollowness does not come from Cameron himself.  · Gaby Hinsliff is political editor of The Observer",Review: Cameron on Cameron by Dylan Jones,2008-08-23T23:01:00Z,Gaby Hinsliff,review
"This summer Dr Ian Dungavell is swimming his way through the aquatic architecture of Victorian and Edwardian England, when Britain led the world as the supreme swimming nation and the equivalents of Michael Phelps learned their trade in canals, mill ponds and the disagreeable water (changed only weekly, and therefore dirtier as the week grew longer) of the municipal baths. Dr Dungavell's long swim is a stunt, but rather an interesting one. As the director of the Victorian Society, he wants to draw attention to the plight of England's old and often handsome public swimming pools, with their ornate tiling and high, echoing roofs. Many have been demolished. Others, saved by architectural listing, have become night clubs, mosques, flats and offices. According to Dr Dungavell, the new-build fixation of local authorities and the way National Lottery grants work - separately for sport and heritage - conspire against keeping old pools as pools. Even the Victoria Baths in Manchester, which received more than £3m after they won the BBC's Restoration show, are dry and will probably never see a swimmer again. The Victorian Society and other campaigners want pools with water, where bathers can enjoy the aesthetics and a continuing local tradition. England has 13 listed buildings that still operate as public pools. Dr Dungavell is swimming all of them. For each year of a pool's age he swims a length - so, for example, on July 28 he swam 104 lengths at the Beverley Road Baths in Hull, because they opened in 1904.  Some pools are longer than others. Swindon's is 33 metres and, as it opened in 1891, Dr Dungavell will next Wednesday need to do 117 laps or 3,861 metres in one go. He refers to the prospect as ""the Swindon nightmare"". We met this week on the train to Brighton, where he was to swim at St Luke's Pool, opened in 1903. He was wearing a T-shirt printed  ""1000yearswim.com"" - from the combined age of the pools (in fact 1,438) - over a lean torso that looked a good advert for frequent swimming. What had been prize discovery of his nine pools to date?  ""Moseley Road in Birmingham and Manningham in Bradford are both tremendous in their different ways. At Manningham they still have tiled spittoons curving out from the pool's edge and the original scum channels down the sides."" A scum channel takes the slops from the surface water. The first few inches are always said to be dirtiest, and before chlorination and filtration arrived in the 1920s swimmers needed to be brave about powering their way through all the things, visible and invisible, that can float free from an immersed body. It may be this folk memory, enshrined in stories about crystals that would turn urine in water pink, that caused ""public baths"" to fall out of fashion. ""Pools"", a word with pleasanter implications, are what we call them now, and this is proper because the baths/pool confusion comes from the 19th century, when an act of parliament enabled local authorities to raise rates to build baths, places for washing, where plunge pools for a little recreational swimming were sometimes added as an afterthought.  But the cleaning of bodies and clothes was seen for decades as their primary purpose and so ""baths"" stuck as the term that covered everything inside them, even after new housing permitted everyone to scrub themselves at home. Long before then, and peculiarly for a cool country surrounded by cold seas, Britain had adopted swimming as a cult. Charles Sprawson tells the story in his magnificent account of swimming history, Haunts of the Black Masseur, first published in 1992. Sprawson writes: ""In the 19th century the English were acknowledged as the best swimmers in the world ... They never for a moment doubted their pre-eminence."" They loved the breast-stroke, which had replaced the doggy paddle around the time of Sir Walter Raleigh, when the main reason to swim was not to drown, and they clung stubbornly to it even after Native American swimmers beat them in racing competitions with the stroke that became known as the crawl.  The crawl's splashing was seen as vulgar and primitive. British swimmers modelled their actions on the frogs that were kept in tubs beside pools as teaching devices. The head was to be kept upright at all times for a stately effect, and also perhaps as a precaution against swallowing water that contained who knew what. Captain Matthew Webb breaststroked his way across the Channel in 1875 and for a week afterwards couldn't wear a collar, owing, Sprawson says, ""to the deep red raw rim at the back of his neck"". Sea, lake and river swimming had drawn gentlemanly, even poetic, addicts from the start of the century. Byron was a great swimmer, who began in the rivers of Aberdeenshire, where he grew up; he had a club foot and water allowed him a grace that land didn't. Algernon Swinburne, a notoriously odd fish, loved being beaten up by the sea and the shingle - he was a masochist - and swam in all weathers in places as chilly as Northumberland and Loch Torridon (reflections of his enthusiasm can be seen in the new interest in ""wild swimming"" and writers such as Robert Macfarlane, Kate Rew and the late Roger Deakin. Less poetically, Manchester produced some world-beating swimmers who trained in canals and the reservoirs that filled the boilers of cotton mills. But it was the heroic exploits of Webb that made Britain swimming-mad and did so much to fuel the boom in municipal pools. By 1911 there were about 600 of them, not including pools such as St Luke's, which was originally attached to a school. It now sits fenced-off from the playground in a hollow facing the sea, a nice little building in red brick with a curved roof and fleur-de-lys on the cast-iron downpipes. Dr Dungavell had never been to St Luke's before and he was taken with it, until we saw the inside. A false ceiling to save on heating bills, all the old cubicles and tilework removed. ""The heart sank,"" he said later, after swimming his 105 lengths of the 15-metre pool in an energetic mixture of dipping breaststroke and crawl. Clive Merrett, one of the pool's lifeguards (now known as leisure attendants), remarked that you never saw the side-stroke these days, though occasionally you saw an older person doing ""the old English backstroke"", arms gently rotating, legs working on the inverted frog model. But it, too, was increasingly rare. I stood on the balcony and looked down on the oblong of liquid blue. St Luke's remains a rudimentary pool, too small for the extras favoured by modern leisure centres: wave machines, flumes, slides. This was its evening session. Women - there were very few men - came out of the changing room and slid into the water. One or two stood chatting in the shallows, others swam along together talking. The rest wore goggles and began to perfect the movements of the frog. Water was their refreshing friend - Paul Valéry called swimming ""fornication avec l'onde"", sex with the wave, and even in the chlorinated water at St Luke's it was possible to see its sensual attraction and the grace it could give the ungainly. The ancient Greeks and Romans knew all this, but how strange that, in Europe at least, the rediscovery and re-celebration of swimming first erupted among a white-skinned people whose teeth chattered when they entered the sea. Britain's few still-active Victorian and Edwardian pools are monuments to their enlightened passion.",Ian Jack: When the English were the world's best swimmers,2008-08-22T23:01:00Z,Ian Jack,society
"Nato is useless. It has failed to bring stability to Afghanistan, as it failed to bring it to Serbia. It just breaks crockery. Nato has proved a rotten fighting force, which in Kabul is on the brink of being sidelined by exasperated Americans. Nor is it any better at diplomacy: witness its hamfisted handling of east Europe. As the custodian of the west's postwar resistance to the Soviet Union's nuclear threat it served a purpose. Now it has become a diplomats' Olympics, irrelevant but with bursts of extravagant self-importance. Yesterday's Nato ministerial meeting in Brussels was a fig leaf over the latest fiasco, the failure to counter the predictable Russian intervention in Georgia. Ostensibly to save Russian nationals in South Ossetia, the intervention was, in truth, to tell Georgia and Ukraine that they must not play games with the west along Russia's frontier. Nato, which Russia would (and should) have joined after the collapse of the Soviet Union, is now a running provocation along the eastern rim of Europe. There was no strategic need for Nato to proselytise for members, and consequent security guarantees, among the Baltic republics and border states to the south. Nor is there any strategic need for the US to place missile sites in Poland or the Czech Republic. This was mere Nato self-aggrandisement reinforcing the lobbying of the Pentagon hawks. These moves were bound to infuriate the hypersensitive Russians, and did. There is no point in western pundits saying that the thrust of Nato close to the Russian border is quite different from the cold war location of Soviet missiles in Cuba. It seems the same to Russian nationalists. Nor is it any good pundits remarking that Russia's defence of Russian minorities in Georgia is quite different from Nato's intervention to defend the Kurdish minority in Iraq or the Albanian minority in Serbia. Again, that is just how it seems to Russia. George Bush said earlier this month that ""the age of spheres of influence is over"". In that case why push that most potent sphere of influence, Nato, to the Russian border? And what of the sphere-of-influence theory that underpinned Bush's neoconservative plan to conquer the Muslim world for democracy? The US's two greatest bugbears at present, Russia and Iran, both have grounds for feeling encircled by hostile forces. However badly they behave, they too are vulnerable to the politics of irrational fear. Both countries display the rudiments of democratic activity, with paranoia playing on pluralism. The glib response of Nato's leaders has been hawkish, that the only thing ""these people"" understand is tough talk and big sticks. But that just apes Russia's attitude towards Georgia and Ukraine, which at least Russia has the power to enforce. The west is not threatened by Russia. Turning its border into a zone of bluff and counter-bluff, so Nato can boast 10 extra flags outside its headquarters, has proved destabilising and provocative. Intelligence, like morality, is supposedly the tribute power should pay to reason. Russia is boorish and belligerent enough already. Why encourage it? With Russia, Nato is playing with fire. In Afghanistan/Pakistan - which should always be yoked together - it is playing with dynamite. Here Osama bin Laden and Donald Rumsfeld must be laughing in unison: the former because Nato's conduct of the war against the Taliban has been a recruiting sergeant for al-Qaida in Pakistan; the latter because everything he said about nation-building has proved true. ""Get in fast and get out fast"" was his strategy, and he was right. The fall of Pervez Musharraf might be good news for Pakistan's democrats. It is dreadful news for Nato's proconsuls in their fortified enclaves in Kabul. The likelihood of political turbulence in Pakistan can only increase the hold that pro-Taliban tribes have over the long frontier with Afghanistan and, with it, the certainty of an escalating war. Nato's performance here has been dreadful. A half-hearted peacekeeper, it had displayed divided counsels, divided leadership and divided rules of engagement. It has reflected the view of the US general in Kosovo, Wesley Clark, that US units should never again be placed under international command. International command means no command at all. A Pentagon report by General Barry McCaffrey, revealed last week, criticises the lack of command unity in Kabul. ""Afghanistan is in misery,"" it says. ""A sensible coordination of all political and military elements of the Afghan theatre of operation does not exist."" There is said to be a plan for a 12,000-strong reinforcement of US troops to stage a Baghdad-style ""surge"", outside the remit of Nato. The idea that the rural Taliban might be susceptible to the same handling as Iraq's urban militias may be senseless, but is on the cards. Such a surge would mean three rival armies - Afghan, Nato and American - roaming this troubled land, a gift to any enemy. The newly triumphant coalition in Islamabad must long for the days when its Afghan backyard was quiet. The Taliban regime was funded by opium and the Saudis, and of no strategic (as opposed to terrorist) concern to the west. There were no US Predators bombing villages, no CIA phone-tapping, no suborned Pakistan intelligence officers, no outside interference. Pakistan's sphere of influence might not be to every taste, but it was roughly stable. We shall now have the world's sixth largest country, and with an active nuclear arsenal, in internal turmoil because of a doomed Nato adventure on its border. Taliban units are operating freely throughout the south and east of Afghanistan and within miles of the capital, Kabul, flatly contradicting the mendacious spin of Nato spokesmen over the past two years. Western governments seem never to learn. Counter-insurgency wars of this sort never work if they become drawn out. At best they leave broken, corrupted, failed states such as Lebanon and Kosovo - and, soon, Iraq. At worst they mean defeat. If ever America were walking into another Vietnam, it is now in Afghanistan, fast replacing Iraq as the mecca for every anti-western fanatic on earth. Peace in Afghanistan might not matter over much. But its absence will grossly destabilise Pakistan, and that matters greatly.

"No one suggests it has suddenly got easier to swim the 200m medley just because Michael Phelps keeps swimming it faster. Yet this morning another generation of A-level students rose from their beds after an anxious night to see the newspaper headlines telling them they might as well not have bothered.  From the way it's written up, A-levels have got so simple all you need do is write your name on the paper: spell it right and you get an A grade. There is an entirely different truth out there: our poor teenagers have just spent two miserable years in the most thankless task of learning how to pass exams.  Francis Gilbert's teacher's perspective on Cif precisely mirrors the experience of my own daughter. During her last two years at school there has been no room for open-minded inquiry, the excitement of the unexpected discovery or serendipitous connection. Instead she can recite how many marks each question is worth and what arguments she needs to spew out in order to score them. Teachers are judged on their results, and their pupils are desperate to get the grades. Together they conspire in a miserably impoverished academic schedule that leaves them unready -– as the universities now complain – to move on. Just look at Michael Phelps' diet and his sad comment that all he's good for is eating, sleeping and swimming and you get a feel for how A-level students feel at the end of their courses. When you have to get to a target, that target is going to be all you want to get to. But at least no one tells Phelps he's wasting his time. So what's to be done? By one measure, the system works. By being exhaustively prescriptive about objectives it has enabled teachers and students to reach them. So stop knocking them for doing what the system asks them to do. Yet some schools are already heading off into different exam systems that will entrench the education divide. The new A* grade, coming in for the new generation of A-level students, will just introduce a new bar to be cleared. Sooner or later, it will be found that an unacceptable number of students can clear it and there will another round of wailing and gnashing of teeth.  No government, it seems, has the courage to acknowledge that A-levels have always been elitist in intent, expressly aimed at selecting a small number capable of going on to university. Instead governments cling to the ""gold standard"" of A-levels while modifying them so that the top level is more accessible.  The unintended but predictable consequence is a system which people want to believe still engenders the highest standards but in fact is a hollowed-out shell. The universities complain that it doesn't do what the old A-levels did. And our poor children spend most of their school lives engaged in dreary classes learning to fit a system that they're then told is worthless. Please, let's think again.",Anne Perkins: A-levels are elitism for everyone,2008-08-14T15:00:00Z,Anne Perkins,uk
"One thing is for sure. This week's operation in Georgia has displayed the failure of the west's policy of belligerence towards Vladimir Putin's Russia. The policy was meant to weaken Russia, and has strengthened it. The policy was meant to humiliate Russia with Nato encirclement, and has merely fed its neo-imperialism. The policy was meant to show that Russia ""understands only firmness"" and instead has shown the west as a bunch of tough-talking windbags. Georgia, a supposed western ally and applicant to Nato, has been treated by Russia to a brutal lesson in power politics. The west has lost all leverage and can do nothing. Seldom was a policy so crashingly stupid. Putin would die laughing if he read this week's American newspapers. The president, George Bush, declared the Russian invasion of Georgia ""disproportionate and unacceptable"". This is taken as a put-down to the vice-president, Dick Cheney, who declared the invasion ""will not go unanswered"", apparently something quite different. Bush says that great powers should not go about ""toppling governments in the 21st century"", as if he had never done such a thing. Cheney says that the invasion has ""damaged Russia's standing in the world"", as if Cheney gave a damn. The lobby for sanctions against Russia is reduced to threatening to boycott the winter Olympics. Big deal. Every student of the Caucasus has known since the fall of the Soviet empire that this part of the world was an explosion waiting to happen. The crisscrossing fault lines of ethnicity, religion and nationalism, fuelled by gas and oil, would not long survive the removal of the Red Army and communist discipline. There were too many old scores to settle, too much territory in dispute and too much wealth at stake - rivalries brilliantly portrayed in Kurban Said's classic novel of Edwardian Azerbaijan, Ali & Nino. In every crisis the west craves goodies and baddies. The media finds it impossible to report a modern conflict without taking sides. In Yugoslavia, where a similar clash of separatist minorities occurred in the 1990s, coverage was so biased that Kosovo is still ""plucky little"" and the Serbs can still do no right. In South Ossetia both sides appear to have committed appalling atrocities, and can thus generate a sense of outrage in front of whatever camera is pointed at them. Georgia's government claimed the right to assert military control over its two dissident provinces, South Ossetia and Abkhazia, even if they were openly in league with Russia. Equally, Russia felt justified in stopping the consequent evictions and killings of its nationals in these provinces, in which it had a humanitarian locus as ""peacekeeper"". The difficulty is that entitlement and good sense are rarely in accord. Georgia may have been entitled to act, but was clearly unwise to do so. Russia may have been entitled to aid its people against an oppressor, but that is different from unleashing its notoriously inept and ruthless army, let alone bombing Georgia's capital and demanding a change in its government. What is clear is that the Georgian president, Mikheil Saakashvili, is a poor advertisement for a Columbia University education. He thought he could reoccupy South Ossetia and call Russia's bluff while Putin was away at the Olympics. He found it was not bluff. Putin was waiting for just such an invitation to humiliate a man he loathes, and to deter any other Russian border state from applying to join Nato, an organisation Russia had itself sought to join until it was rudely rebuffed. Saakashvili thought he could call on the support of his neoconservative allies in Washington. Tbilisi is one of the few world cities in which Bush's picture is a pin-up and where an avenue is named after him. It turned out that such ""support"" was mere words. America is otherwise engaged in wars that bear a marked resemblance to those waged by Putin. It defended the Kurdish enclaves against Saddam Hussein. It sought regime change in Serbia and Afghanistan. As Putin's troops in South Ossetia were staging a passable imitation of the US 101st Airborne entering Iraq, Bush was studiously watching beach volleyball in Beijing. The truth is that the world has no conceptual framework for adjudicating, let alone resolving, these timeless border conflicts. Where poverty is rife, it takes only a clan war and a ready supply of guns for hostilities to break out. The only question is how to stop them escalating. Once such conflicts could be quarantined by the United Nations' requirement to respect national sovereignty. That has been shot to pieces by the liberal interventionism of George Bush and Tony Blair. The result has reinvigorated separatist movements across the world. Small-statism is not an evil in itself: witness its quadrennial festival at the Olympics. But the process of achieving it is usually bitter and bloody. The west's eagerness to intervene in favour of partition, manifest in Yugoslavia, Iraq and Sudan, is more than meddling. It encouraged every oppressed people and province on earth to be ""the mouse that roared"", to think it could ensnare a great power in its cause. The parallels are glaring. If we backed Kosovo against the Serbs, why not back South Ossetia against the Georgians? But if we backed the Kurds against the Iraqis, why not the Georgians against Russia? Indeed, had Nato admitted Georgia to full membership, there is no knowing what Caucasian horror might have ensued from the resulting treaty obligation. Decisions which in Washington and London may seem casual gestures of ideological solidarity can mean peace and war on the ground. I retain an archaic belief that the old UN principle of non-interference, coupled with a realpolitik acceptance of ""great power"" spheres of influence, is still a roughly stable basis for international relations. It may on occasions be qualified by soft-power diplomacy and humanitarian relief. It may demand an abstinence from kneejerk gestures in favour of leaving things to sort themselves out (as in Zimbabwe). But liberal interventionism, especially when it leads to military and economic aggression, means one costly adventure after another - and usually failure. The west has done everything to isolate Putin, as he rides the tiger of Russian emergence from everlasting dictatorship. This has encouraged him to care not a fig for world opinion. Equally the west has encouraged Saakashvili to taunt Putin beyond endurance. The policy has led to war. If ever there were a place just to leave alone, it is surely the Caucasus. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com · This article was amended on Saturday August 16 2008.

"The function of the political spouse used to be straightforward. If you were Denis Thatcher it was to travel in the wake of the SS Margaret and collect the body parts. For most others, the public role was traditionally to support the appearance of normality and, if necessary, heterosexuality. This summer a new model has emerged: the wife as published author and representative in a proxy popularity contest. So the news that Ffion Hague, author of The Pain and The Privilege: The Women in Lloyd George's Life, has beaten Cherie Blair, who wrote Speaking for Myself, in a survey of MPs' summer reading has been excitedly reported as the ultimate triumph for the tortoise once so utterly trounced by the Blairite hare. Hague's book is even ranked 625th to Blair's 2,023rd on Amazon. It's a good read, and undoubtedly took longer to research and write than Blair's, which was about herself anyway. Hague's book is also more prurient, but Lloyd George's sex life was in the past, the wives and lovers long gone. As far as we know, there are no lovers in the Blair story, and Cherie failed to see that the details of her contemporary marital arrangements would prove to be more toe-curling than titillating. William Hague's two biographies, of William Wilberforce and Pitt the Younger, are also selling well, and the Tories probably hope that the success of Ffion's book is another indicator of the rehabilitation of a party once proud to be known as stupid but now flaunting not just book-writing intellectuals but Tories who write about great reformers and political radicals, perhaps of the type David Cameron aspires to be.  As for Tony Blair, history may be unkind, but I bet it will also be admiring, rather as people still think Lloyd George did some terrible things but was nonetheless an extraordinary politician who almost alone understood how the world had changed between 1914 and 1939. And, just as there was a great book in the women who put up with the Welsh Goat, one day someone will write a cracking biography of Cherie Blair.

"The raging speculation about the pre-election defenestration of Gordon Brown has spawned a fierce argument about one of the summer's great quandaries: is David Miliband a paid-up Blairite? Viewed from a certain angle, the question suggests a pantomimic Labour version of McCarthyism; certainly, the swaths of print already devoted to it are the party's surreal phoney war at its worst. One day, a tribute to the elder Miliband's collectivism and attachment to equality; soon after, a claim that he actually believes all the central Blairite tenets. Last Tuesday, there were rumours, quickly denied, of a deal whereby he would make Alan Milburn his chancellor; by Friday, an article in the Spectator was assuring the Labour family that Miliband is ""Blairesque"" rather than Blairite, and really a ""hi-tech Fabian"".  Despite the prevailing argument's caricatures of Miliband as either a craven restorationist or progressive saviour, one can perhaps nail his position in more nuanced terms: he may well have at least some of the social-democratic instincts lacked by Milburn, Stephen Byers, James Purnell and John Hutton, but stock lines about ""real change"" are not nearly enough to make him an heir apparent - and come any leadership contest, he should be asked some very tough questions. With all that in mind, though, another point rears up: with possible candidacies from just about all strands of the party, isn't it strange that a genuinely uber-Blairite challenger is so unlikely to materialise? As things stand, Miliband would have the support of that credo's devotees, but he would not make the case for the policies - schools vouchers, say, or converting the NHS into a mere commissioner of privately delivered care - they hold dear. Purnell, the only halfway realistic challenger who would preach an eye-wateringly Blairite gospel, has already served notice that he would not run against Miliband, a move of a piece with the familiar uber-Blairite tactic of remaining away from the fray, knowing that once the jostling is over they can carry on punching way above their weight. And so it would prove: if Miliband won, the prospect of him markedly departing from the Blairite path seems less likely than some of his more fervent admirers think - but if he dared, they would make no end of mischief. Troublemaking is their metier - and in terms of influence, it seems to have its rewards. Despite his central place in months of seditious intrigue, last week saw the Miliband-Milburn rumours trailed by hair-raising whispers about Brown attempting to bring the latter (the recipient of tidy fees for advising Pepsi-Cola, Lloyds Pharmacy, US health giant Covidien and the private equity company Bridgepoint Capital) back to government. Milburn apparently wasn't interested, but his latest work, a report for the Blairite pressure group Progress, gives a familiar flavour of what he would bring with him: hyperbolic talk about an ""irreversible shift of power to the users of services"" that sweetens a tired old dream of waking up to find public services run by the kind of companies that have made Milburn's acquaintance, with a few contracts given to charities.  Meanwhile, Purnell's welfare reforms point to much the same vision, while other Blairites thumb their noses at anyone who would like the government to take a last-ditch turn towards something more progressive - witness John Hutton's apparently successful noises off about the undesirability of a windfall levy on energy companies, why a revival of coal-fired power is a great idea, and how millionaires deserve adulation rather than a higher rate of tax.  In response to all this, there are two questions. First, at its foundations, what does uber-Blairism now amount to? Its disciples waged war on the left's attachment to the public sector; then, they recast its attachment to equality as a matter of ""capping aspiration""; and of late, as the Tories have shifted towards a more sensible tone on social matters, most of this faction have seen not an opportunity for a more enlightened debate, but the chance to jump to their right. As a vision of the good society, they still offer only a thin idea of meritocracy that withers under inspection and blurs over into much the same stuff one hears from the Cameroons. We are now promised a handful of new ideas from a coterie that seems to include Milburn, Charles Clarke (not quite a Blairite, but an ardent fellow traveller), and Byers. The last floated the first wheeze this month: with close to 5 million people on the waiting list for social housing, he proposes giving government money to the 12% of Britons who are council tenants and thereby nudging them towards the private housing market. It looks rather like a cunning plan to bring the UK a fresh sub-prime mortgage crisis, and only points up how out of time the uber-Blairites look, blithely peddling ""aspirational"" schemes that bump up against the need for a politics that offers solidarity and reassurance. When it comes to their ideas for schools and hospitals, one wonders: at the point that playing the market has turned so toxic, is it really the time to be proposing to extend such imperatives to the one part of society in which they are just about held at bay? And so to the really big question: within the Labour movement, who do these people speak for? It's a query that brings to mind what Stalin famously said of the Pope: ""How many divisions has he got?"" Aside from a smattering of backbench rent-a-gobs and robotic super-loyalists, what number of Labour MPs have any truck with uber-Blairism? Do the pitifully few numbers of party activists who are left find their spirits raised by paeans to the super-rich and attacks on welfare malingerers and go knocking on doors to tell wavering voters the good news?  I could be wrong. Uber-Blairism may command sleeping legions of supporters ready to spring to its defence. Though its friends within the commentariat talk up its importance, its actual clout is pointed up by a recent telling episode: someone tried something close to an uber-Blairite pitch for a senior Labour position, and look where it got her. In last year's deputy leadership election, Hazel Blears finished sixth out of six. The truth is, it's probably better for this faction to carry on as it is, politicking backstage, and pushing schemes that only a tiny minority of the Labour party actually wants. How beautifully ironic: people who set such store by choice and contestability, too frit to turn such terrifying forces on themselves. john.harris@theguardian.com","John Harris: For all the noise, there are barely any uber-Blairites left",2008-08-10T23:01:00Z,John Harris,politics
"How many Conservative MPs, sullenly absorbing the full horror of their holiday reading lists, have wondered why, if all this history and political philosophy is so crucial a part of a modern Tory's hinterland, their leader is only ever pictured with glossy new storybooks with girls and sex in them? How come Paradise Lost, Smyrna 1922: The Destruction of Islam's City of Tolerance did not feature on Cameron's recent, faux holiday in rocky Cornwall, atop a pile of 38 books said to be essential reading for the ambitious backbencher? Instead, between chucking Frisbees and planting kisses on Mrs Cameron, this playful hypocrite flourished a copy of Devil May Care, a new James Bond adventure said to be essential reading for people who don't really go in for books. Last year, for a pretend tube-train journey, he was accessorised with a copy of Ian McEwan's On Chesil Beach, which compensates for being a bit highbrow by also being a novella. Rumours that, in any case, Cameron gets his driver to do all the heavy reading for him (leaving him free to compile fave playlists for Barack Obama) have done little to placate backbenchers whose summer holidays are about to be devastated by Andrew Roberts's Master and Commanders, How Roosevelt, Churchill, Marshall and Alanbrooke won the war in the West, 1941-45 My advice is for these Tories to read David Runciman's Political Hypocrisy: The Mask of Power, from Hobbes to Orwell and Beyond, then lie about all the rest. With the exception of Ferdinand Mount's captivating memoir, Cold Cream, there is nothing else on the list that cannot wait until a diagnosis of glandular fever, or the next life, whichever comes first. A good many titles - popular psychology books in particular - will be exposed in all their glib irrelevance the minute it is Cameron's turn to be asked how he plans to nudge British troops out of Iraq, or to deploy the carrot, rather than the stick, when persuading young men to cease knifing one another. Any MP who invests time in Runciman's book, on the other hand, will be rewarded with a liberating, sophisticated-sounding defence of professional hypocrisy that should serve for a working lifetime. At the crudest level, it is a political hypocrite's charter. For no more than £17.95 even the dimmest Tory MP can learn, from a skip-reading of Runciman, to counter accusations of duplicity with the lofty observation that hypocrisy is an inevitable part of the compromises that constitute democratic political life. Something that's been with us for ever. And, as Bernard Mandeville (1670-1733) more or less said, just what's so bad about clever, stylish, hypocrisy? Only a baby, or Messianic nutter, would believe a nation could sustain a political life of total sincerity. With a little practice, diligent students of Runciman should soon be a match for George Monbiot, who could be found last week updating la Rochefoucauld ('hypocrisy is a tribute vice pays to virtue'), in support of a claim that hypocrites like himself are, in fact, the world's biggest idealists. 'Sure we are hypocrites,' he declared. 'Every one of us is, almost by definition. Hypocrisy is the gap between your aspirations and your actions.' Plainly, the more hypocritical, the greener; the better; the more fully endowed with eye-catching vision. With hypocrisy's rehabilitation proceeding at this lively pace there must soon be hard questions on the Today programme for politicians whose actions conform, with pathetic integrity, to the limited scope of their ambitions. Not to mention hope for those hoping to see a similar broad-mindedness extended in future to traditional 'vices' such as lying, corruption, criminal damage. Haven't we all been there, done that? What prompted Monbiot's apologia was a new, perhaps unfortunately timed, book from Julie Burchill: Not in My Name: A Compendium of Modern Hypocrisy. 'In the constellation of modern hypocrisy,' writes Ms Burchill, who is something of a traditionalist where brazen misrepresentation is concerned, 'the Green shines a million times brighter than any of his half-hearted, two-faced comrades in duplicity.' She could not have known that, thanks to Monbiot, the world's happiest hypocrite, her essay would soon be read as an extended compliment. 'Greens have high aspirations,' he acknowledged in the Guardian. 'They want to live more ethically - and they will always fall short. But the alternative to hypocrisy isn't moral purity (no one manages that) but cynicism.' Which is nonsense. Even if many of us (as it is increasingly common to hear from prominent hypocrites) are small-time hypocrites, it hardly signifies, since so few of us are also influential public figures. Moreover, there are many options, besides cynicism, to straightforward hypocrisy; from agonised pragmatism to Monbiot's own, more feline style of dissimulation. None of us should be fooled by Monbiot's confession of his fallibility, and not just because you never find him applying the same, good-humoured indulgence to the shortcomings of Bush or Brown. 'Knowingness about political hypocrisy is no more an escape from it than any other kind of inside knowledge,' explains Runciman, 'because it too can be deployed as a mask.' Still, that little complication does not stop ours being a terrifically promising time for political hypocrites. Even before academe offered them historical respectability, and the Green movement supplied its blessing, there was evidence of a growing tolerance for such world-class humbugs as Bill Clinton (who re-emerged last week to lecture Africans on the merits of monogamy), and, closer to home, of Cameron, whose brilliant play-acting often seems the most genuine thing about him. No matter: the public clearly knows, but does not care, that months after lamenting the horrors of 'Punch and Judy politics', Master Manners began shouting 'loser' and other ugly things at Gordon Brown. It has quite forgiven 'carbon-conscious' Cameron for ostentatiously cycling to work at the same time that his car trailed behind with a change of socks. So it certainly won't mind that, at the same time that they are quiveringly alert to any sniff of Labour hypocrisy (over Post Offices, schools, toffs, whatever), Tory MPs are being urged to study a book which teaches that they are, inevitably, just as two-faced: 'There is no way of breaking out from the hypocrisy of political life, and all attempts to find such an escape route are a delusion.' Which is not to say that some forms of hypocrisy are not significantly more nauseating than others. Did Cameron ever get to the bit, near the end, where Runciman explains why the behaviour of a certain type of ostensibly sincere political hypocrite, who makes capital out of his personal lifestyle, 'like the British Conservative leader David Cameron', is 'corrosive' in a way that straightforward hypocrisy is not? Probably not. He will have been much too busy on his low-carbon Cornish holiday, with the wife, kids, shorts, distressed polo-shirt, Frisbee and James Bond book.

"By the time you read this, world peace should have broken out. It should have broken out at precisely 8.08pm Beijing time yesterday, because International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge has made his traditional plea for a worldwide military truce for the duration of the games. Yet on the offchance that the Taliban are not laying in supplies of popcorn and preparing for a fortnight on the sofa, and US and British soldiers are not garlanding their tanks with flowers, now might be the time to question the IOC's preposterously idealised version of itself. There's nothing wrong with calling for world peace, of course - beauty queens do it all the time. But you do need to follow it up with something special in the swimsuit round, and one can't help feeling that the more of itself the IOC bares, the more hideous it appears.  Strip away the grandiose statements, and an examination of how it treats the little guy should tell you all you need to know. Joey Cheek is the former speedskating gold medallist who co-founded Team Darfur, the international athletes' coalition which highlights the crisis in Sudan. Hours before he was due to travel to Beijing this week, the American's visa was summarily revoked by the Chinese government. Asked to comment on this blatant attempt to suppress an Olympic hero, an IOC droid explained ""non-accredited persons do not fall within the IOC's remit"". Isn't it amazing how swiftly one passes from being the winner of the Olympic Spirit Award to the status of ""non-accredited person""? Two years ago Cheek won the honour following the winter games in Turin, after donating his medal bonuses to a sport aid organisation. Today, he lacks the requisite paperwork to merit even an IOC platitude.  The decision to award the games to Beijing was always morally compromised - luminously so - and yet again the IOC find themselves highlighting their own absurdity. You can't call for an immediate cessation of hostilities around the globe and in the next breath decline to get involved in a serious humanitarian issue because a former gold medallist doesn't have the right accreditation pass. It's like demanding an end to poverty then refusing to give tuppence to a beggar on the basis that he isn't wearing a club tie.  Amazingly, it's not even the IOC's most unedifying moment of the past fortnight. That honour belongs to their decision to suspend the entire Iraqi Olympic team on the basis that the country's National Olympic Committee had not been properly recognised by the IOC. Clearly, Iraq's real crime was not having the right paperwork, though before rescinding the ban on some (but not all) of the athletes, the IOC chuntered that it was because of suspicions of ""political interference in the Olympic movement"".  Last week I asked them to clarify why they had never suspected political interference when one Uday Hussein was chairman of the NOC. Unfortunately, they were far too grand to comment, but having since read senior IOC member Dick Pound's book, I discover that they couldn't be sure that Uday was a political placeman. Thank God they didn't put two and two together and make five.  Instead, they focus on issuing directives forbidding athletes from making any political statements. Surely it's time the IOC re-examined their definition of what it means to be political. It seems entirely acceptable for states to politicise the games by using them as propaganda, and for corporations to do the same (22 years of McDonald's sponsorship feels faintly agenda-driven). Only the athletes are warned not to step out of line.  Priorities being what they are, the IOC did not bother to issue similar directives instructing China not to bulldoze homes to make way for the new Beijing. And yet they must have known this would happen, as so many games have been preceded by what we might euphemistically describe as a tidying away of humans who don't match the decor. Consider Mexico City, where police opened fire and killed hundreds of student protesters; or Atlanta, where the organising committee actually built the jail to which many people who committed new offences on the city statute book - like lying down in the street - were dispatched. This is not ""peace through sport"". These things happen precisely because the Olympic games are coming to town, and it should be the IOC's job to ensure that what is an amazing, inspiring world event does not come at the expense of the vulnerable.  Perhaps the most chillingly revelatory moment in Pound's book is a quote from former IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, explaining why it was preferable for games to be staged in closed societies or dictatorships. ""'Leesten, Deek,' he said to me at one point. 'For [the Olympics], it is much better to go to these countries. There will never be security problems.'"" This week, some Beijing street signs bore in the instruction ""Stay in to make space for foreign friends"". Stay in, stay grateful, stay schtum.  Watching the IOC grease up to the Chinese government, one can only wonder sarcastically what on earth attracted this one set of appalling old waxworks to the other - apart from a straightforward Narcissus complex.  marina.hyde@theguardian.com",Marina Hyde: These two appalling sets of old waxworks utterly deserve each other,2008-08-08T23:01:00Z,Marina Hyde,world
"Americans do it clean, Britons do it dirty. Americans have term limits on high office. Their contestants come out in the open, take off their shirts and fight to known rules. They say who they are and what they represent. The people then decide.  Monday's headline read: ""Blairites plot to hasten prime minister's exit."" Forgive me, but what business is it of theirs? For the second time in just over a year, Britain must contemplate a small political club choosing a new ruler without so much as a passing reference to the electorate. We read of cabals and cliques at Westminster, uttering squeals and burps, for the interpretation of which we rely on an inner priesthood of lobby journalists. We read nothing of elections.  The club behaves like all British clubs. Members murmur in corridors, squeeze arms, write nuanced articles and give opaque interviews. Friendship is poisoned by ambition, because this electoral college is composed exclusively of ""friends"". Treason can take wing since, ""If it prosper, none dare call it treason"".  Last week the foreign secretary, David Miliband, stepped forward as the new Michael Heseltine to Gordon Brown's Margaret Thatcher. One more politician believes he can cheat the curse that he who wields the dagger never wears the crown. Miliband's article in these pages, with its much commented-upon failure to mention Brown, must have been a shard of steel in the latter's heart. Rarely can one omitted name have carried such savage import.  With the equilibrium of cabinet loyalty thus disturbed, Brown's colleagues are liberated to perform patricide in their or her own peculiar way. Once the assassin has broken cover, this customarily takes the form of showering the victim with support that suggests not only that he badly needs it but that he cannot rely on it for long. When a man so recently anointed is described by his three closest colleagues as ""unquestionably the best man to lead us into the next election"", the questions raised are, why those three, why say it now, and why the silence from the rest? Uneasy indeed lies the head that wears the crown.  A fiction of British politics is that, unlike in presidential systems, leadership is subsumed in party. Elections are meant to be choices between policy pantechnicons. But choosing the leader assigned the task of delivering these options is not a matter for the electorate, or even for the public gaze. Leadership selection in Britain is performed by consenting adults in private. This no longer makes democratic sense, if it ever did. The growth and acceptance of the welfare state and Thatcher's ""change"" revolution have closed the policy gap between the parties. The language and gimmicks bandied about Westminster are so interchangeable as to be the source of mirth in the Commons. Meanwhile the role of personality, better called character, is long recognised by the mass marketing of leaders. The perceived failure of John Major, Iain Duncan Smith and Gordon Brown, and the success of Tony Blair and David Cameron, are not attributed to some great divergence of policy. They are put down to qualities of confidence, likability and courtly prominence, summed up in the word charisma.  The failure of Brown to live up to the expectation he aroused just a year ago has nothing to do with his ideas or policies. It is due to his lack of public appeal - in a nutshell to his personality. The thesis, much espoused by Guardian contributors, that Brown has totally changed and thus polluted their constancy of judgment, is ludicrous. Their former presentation - indeed, eulogising - of him was plain wrong.  No less eccentric is the code now required of the conspirators to bring about Brown's downfall. Miliband's article merits being seen as a set text of this code. Its political content was near zero, an intellectual morass of ""not yielding to fatalism"", being ""humble about shortcomings"" and ""sharing a restlessness for change"".  Change has been, for the Blair-Brown ascendancy, the same buzzword that socialism was to an earlier Labour generation, though wholly devoid of meaning. Miliband tossed out a few hostages to fortune, such as support for lower energy bills which, were he an economist, he would know implies higher consumption. He favours windfall utilities taxes and something called ""winning the peace"" in Iraq.  But he is a thinktanker rather than an executive breed of politician. He has never shown much understanding of how to make an organisation deliver his ideas. As schools minister he was obsessed with targets and testing, then said he was against them. As environment minister he was for personal carbon credits but did nothing about them. At local government he proclaimed the new localism and ""double devolution"", and did nothing but make speeches. At the Foreign Office he has followed Whitehall's line of least resistance, supporting America's wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  What Miliband is doing and what his colleagues know he is doing is signalling that he is ready not for ""change"" but for leadership. Last year he was indecisive over challenging Brown for the leadership. He knows what dithering cost Brown in the past, and that politics likes a chancer.  Miliband will fight if the opening occurs, and rivals like Jack Straw, Harriet Harman or (my outside bet) John Denham must make dispositions accordingly. While the odds must still be on Brown leading Labour into a 2010 election, the elephant of the cliche is in the room. Another succession race has begun.  Democracy is again a bystander. The public's sole participation in this decision is through the proxy of the opinion polls. The code has ordained that Brown is at risk ""unless he succeeds in refreshing the agenda this autumn"". Agenda refreshment means no more than a scattergun of Downing Street task forces and giveaways. What is meant is that Brown must pick up in the polls.  If you are one of the lucky 1,200 customarily approached by a pollster and weighted by class, age and sex, a heavy responsibility rests on your shoulders. You have been chosen at random to help the club members decide who should lead Britain. As for whether I think this is a good way of choosing a leader in a democracy, I do not. But then all the constitutional reformers in the world will never persuade me that British politics is not stuck irredeemably in the 18th century. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com","Simon Jenkins on David Milliband, Gordon Brown and the Labour leadership",2008-08-05T23:01:00Z,Simon Jenkins,politics
"It was only last April that energy secretary John Hutton persuaded Britain's big six energy companies to double their spending on social tariffs for the fuel poor, to £100m this year. The proud boast was an extra 100,000 people would pay greatly reduced fuel bills. Then came commitments to invest in renewables and nuclear as part of a concerted drive to make Britain's energy more secure, cheaper and with a lower carbon footprint. In energy legislation, economic rationality, social justice and business-friendly policies were marching in happy union. Labour had everything under control. Four months later and the story looks very different. Oil prices have rocketed; gas prices followed suit. Although they try to hedge against such massive price hikes, energy companies are having to increase their tariffs. Centrica has been pilloried on all sides for raising gas prices by 35 per cent; frankly, given that the price of natural gas in the wholesale markets has risen by 350 per cent in 12 months, the surprise is that the hike is so small. If John Hutton had succeeded in taking 100,000 out of fuel poverty, gas price rises on this scale will plunge another million straight back into a grim universe in which 10 per cent of their income is dedicated to paying energy bills, the definition of fuel poverty. Suddenly the air is thick with calls for windfall taxes on energy companies, particularly as oil giants BP and Shell are reporting massive profits. Such loot should be diverted to alleviate the conditions of approaching five million fuel-poor, runs the argument. After all, in 1997 New Labour raised some £5bn in a windfall profits tax - justified because the privatised utilities had been given away too cheaply - to fund spending on education and the New Deal. Now it should do something similarly radical and popular to head off electorally damaging increases in its voters' fuel bills. Chancellor Alistair Darling is said to be actively considering just such a move. But as much as introducing a one-off tax on the energy companies to make a one-off payment to the fuel-poor, the government needs to address the way the entire energy market - and welfare system - is organised. To further tax Centrica, for example, whose 58 per cent tax rate is the highest in the FTSE 100, simply because the oil price has gone up is arbitrary. Is the government proposing a rebate when oil and gas prices fall? The problem is much deeper. If you want to criticise the free market, look at the design of Britain's energy markets, particularly the wholesale market for gas where the big companies buy and sell to one another. As gas prices shadow every movement in oil price, other European countries have carefully built a substantial infrastructure to hold sufficient reserve stocks of gas in their systems to smooth price changes. Not in free-market Britain. Amazingly, as North Sea gas production declines and we become more dependent on imports, we have capacity to store only 13 days' worth of gas. Germany has 99 and France 122. This would be less worrying if imported liquefied natural gas could enter the country easily, but the terminals are not run to make it easy to bring in extra deliveries, rather to maximise the short-term profits of the companies that run the ports. There is absolutely no slack in the system. So as wholesale gas prices have risen, the British system has offered no buffer to smooth the impact. Worse, the London oil market has been designed only to benefit its member traders. The so-called London loophole, created by the Labour government, excuses the London oil market from independent and transparent oversight. Traders' positions are unpoliced; the scope for market manipulation is vast, the extent unknown. Britain has resisted worldwide criticism, arguing that London-based speculation and rigging has nothing to do with the oil price rise; but the $25 a barrel collapse in the price over the last three weeks as speculators unwind their position has made the government's argument untenable. Speculation is part of the oil price rise, and most of it is rooted in out-of-control London. Meanwhile, hoped-for rises in gas supplies from Europe via the so-called 'Interconnector', the pipeline between Belgium and Bacton in Norfolk that might keep the price down, failed to materialise. European producers prefer to keep their gas at home to insulate their own markets from the increases. If the government was serious about energy prices it would want to redesign this market structure. It would invest in this missing gas infrastructure, police the way oil trading is conducted and create a less volatile environment. It should move on every front. In parallel it should address fuel poverty. Winter fuel payments of up to £300 are currently paid to everybody over 60, whatever their income. Instead, the system should be re-organised so that the fuel-poor of whatever age get support. Identifying who they are is expensive and difficult, but leaving it to the energy companies to decide is a cop-out. The government needs to take responsibility, and then direct the energy companies to organise their social tariffs accordingly. Most would be relieved, as EDF Energy tells the stakeholder advisory panel that I chair. All this costs money, and one source suggested by the Business and Enterprise Committee, is to claw back some of the benefits, estimated at £9bn, that energy companies will rack up through being given free permits to trade emissions between now and 2012. This can be justified as getting back taxpayers' money that was given away too easily, rather than arbitrarily taxing companies just because energy prices are high. Nobody can prevent energy from becoming more expensive in an era of scarcity. But there are measures to ease the impact and spread the pain. They should be taken, even if powerful City and oil trading interests will protest that their freedoms are being constrained. The rest of us will pay less to stay warm.",Will Hutton: Don't make the consumer pay for these inflated fuel prices,2008-08-02T23:01:00Z,Will Hutton,politics
"It's some measure of how low the Brown premiership has laid Labour politics that when someone sounds engaged, guardedly optimistic and something like an example of homo sapiens, you momentarily think you're listening to a miracle-worker, but there it is: not that I hold much of a candle for him politically, but David Miliband's appearance on Thursday's Jeremy Vine show will presumably keep the talk about his leadership prospects simmering nicely. ""You sound alive,"" raved one bloke who emailed in – which, in its encapsulation of hilariously low expectations, rather said it all. Fair play to the elder Miliband, mind you: in recent years, I've observed – at least once, at close quarters – his careful PR schtick turn a little too brittle and jumped-up, but today, he did just about everything right. A couple of calls from the Down The Line school of absurdity (one man wondered why Britain spent money on ""foreigners"" when so much was wrong at home) were assuredly handled, with no hint of being patronising; when Mandy from Barnsley phoned in to announce an end to a lifetime of Labour voting on account of a downturn that was all Brown's fault, Miliband encouraged her to let rip, and capably parried every point. Even when Vine pushed him on his leadership ambitions, he managed to make stock lines sound like reasonable answers, and calmly had his cake while eating it. If you didn't hear it, his take on the possibility of becoming PM went something like this. When Vine played him a tape of the plainspoken backbencher Geraldine Smith slamming his apparent disloyalty and calling for his head, he said that Labour would be doomed ""if we all went mute"" and that the party's senior figures had to show that ""we do want to engage with people"" (it's always a start, eh?). Towards the end of the interview, there was an oblique reference to the story about the young Michael Heseltine writing a career plan that climaxed with Downing Street on the back of an envelope, and this: ""I always say, 'Focus on the job you've got.'"" Oh, and he dutifully paid occasional tribute to Gordon Brown, but not so fulsomely as to call time on speculation about his own ambitions. A good performance, then – even his everyman-ish glottal stops are sounding more natural. That said, in the course of his allotted hour, as with his now-legendary piece for yesterday's Guardian, there were pretty obvious signs of what Miliband sorely lacks. Simply put, there were no coded references – aside from another pledge to ""protect"" people from the current downturn – to any shift from the Blairite verities that often seem to be carved into his soul, nor any sense that he might restore Labour's sense of moral purpose, nor any meaty justifications for the pro-Miliband arguments that put him in a different political place from the likes of James Purnell, John Hutton and good old Caroline Flint. Such were the questions Vine failed to ask, but someone will sooner or later have to. One last thing, while we're here – the Miliband story is being frantically talked up in the face of a consideration that very few people seem to be mentioning: as Rhodri Morgan pointed out yesterday, even come the autumn, to knock Brown aside and then call the inevitable general election would surely be to commit quick political suicide. For now, though, who cares about any of that? With what must have been mischievous intent, Vine broke up the spoken-word stuff by playing Texas's vapid 1997 hit Say What You Want, which pretty much nails the average hack's view of the Boy David: ""You can say what you want,/ but I won't change my mind/ I'll feel the same/ about you.",John Harris: David Miliband does Radio 2 well,2008-07-31T14:54:12Z,John Harris,politics
"In today's housing market, you don't argue with a potential buyer. Selling our house required us to exchange and complete in seven days and of course we agreed. The house price surveys don't convey the scale of the crisis in the market or the price falls. So, a frenzied seven days later, we moved out and probably became the British housing market's transaction in July. It's only partly a joke. Mortgage approvals are running a third of a year ago; prices are down over 15 per cent from their peak, with the rate of fall accelerating. The situation is extraordinarily dangerous. In America, house prices have fallen by more than 20 per cent and the US financial system is tottering. One big West Coast lender, IndyMac, has gone to the wall; last week, Washington Mutual, the country's biggest savings and loan association, analogous to a building society, was reported to be in trouble. There was subsequent carnage in bank shares on Wall Street, despite the US showing an activism we can only dream about. But the UK housing market and the position of our financial system are much more vulnerable than America's. Over the past 10 years, US house prices have risen by 105 per cent, ours by 180 per cent. Although both countries are saturated by mortgage debt, Britain is more indebted. Economists judge whether houses are cheap or expensive in relation to salaries, disposable income or rents. If, on a composite measure, American houses were 25 per cent too high last year, ours were 50 per cent too high. Yet compare the reactions. The US has slashed interest rates to 2 per cent while British rates are pegged at 5 per cent. It has a system of standardised or 'conforming' mortgages that properly certify an individual's income and employment history and which can thus be guaranteed or insured by giant, government-sponsored agencies such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Housing Administration in the event of default. Eighty per cent of new mortgages in the first six months of this year were guaranteed conforming mortgages. Britain has nothing. The US also has a well-developed system of protection and insurance for depositors. We have a Mickey Mouse system that the banks resist strengthening. The US markets in which banks trade in residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), a crucial source of finance for mortgage lending, are greatly helped by the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation. It ensures that if for any reason a bank does not settle its bills, the Clearing Corporation will. So while the specialist American markets have been beset by fear like ours, they have not completely shut like the British.  I have no doubt that historians will look back at the early 2000s as years of dazzling incompetence. The largely unregulated British financial system was allowed to fuel an unsustainable house price boom. The consequent levels of debt collateralised against crazily valued house prices was an act of folly, a dereliction of duty by the City of London that financed the lending, the Bank of England and Financial Services Authority that indulged it and a New Labour government too frightened to prevent it. It will take a long time to be forgiven or forgotten.  The buy-to-let market, for example, was completely dependent on the RMBS market to finance its lending. Now it is in crisis; buy-to-let lending, which in 2007 represented 30 per cent of all new lending, has dried up. Paragon, Britain's third-biggest buy-to-let lender, has been unable to lend for six months; it is in talks with, among others, American private equity group, the Blackstone Group, in turn part owned by the Chinese Communist party, about a takeover. Its HQ in Solihull could thus become a small colony of the People's Republic of China, an unexpected boast for the West Midlands. This is part of the wider dismemberment of our financial system. Alliance & Leicester is about to be taken over by the Spanish bank Santander. The vultures circle stricken HBOS. Northern Rock is in public ownership. The financial system is being rocked to its foundations more than at any time since the 19th century and, if house prices carry on falling, it will be even more shaken and without the basic protections that exist in the US What to do now? The only good news is that at least house prices have fallen quickly, between half and two-thirds of the necessary adjustment. A couple of insiders, justifying the government's laissez-faire inactivity, have told me there needs to be a substantial correction before creating any American-style interventions to stabilise the market. Prices needed to fall, but I would be more confident if I felt that more officials understood the risks and dangers. If 2008's house price fall extends into 2009 and 2010, Britain will be engulfed. A recession will be guaranteed. We need interest rate reductions and fast. Britain needs effective deposit insurance, for which the Governor of the Bank of England is agitating but which the British Bankers' Association (Bonuses'R'Us) naturally resists. We also need some government-initiated form of reinsurance for new mortgage lending to persuade lenders they have protection against default.  We need the RMBS market re-opened by a combination of creating a clearing corporation and the Bank of England being more generous about offering potential lender-of-last-resort facilities to the market.  The City will say these measures imperil its main objective of being more deregulated than anywhere else. I argue it has a prior responsibility to British depositors, policyholders, mortgage borrowers - us - and the wider British economy. No City or Conservative party spokesman agrees.  The government is inching towards a cluster of measures, some along these lines, to be announced in the autumn. But strong technical measures, if it has the chutzpah to initiate them, are only part of what is needed. The rest, borrowing from Barack Obama's appeal, is an optimistic rhetoric that public action can make things better. Success requires both. The government's future depends on it rising to the challenge.",Will Hutton: A week that taught me home truths about the housing crisis,2008-07-26T23:01:00Z,Will Hutton,politics
"It has occurred to me more than once that I really must endeavour not to be a bad person, because that would increase my chances of being reincarnated as the absolute lowest form of life - no, not plankton or one of those insects that lives on dung, but even worse than that - a male vegetarian.  The same male vegetarians were in the news last week because the Harvard School of Health has warned that tofu, something of a veggie staple, appearing in anything from soy sausages to yoghurt to energy bars, can have an adverse effect on male fertility, with even modest amounts significantly lowering sperm count.  It gets better. It seems that all this is due to soya compounds called isoflavones, which mimic the female sex hormone, oestrogen. So there you have it - male vegetarians are shooting blanks and not enough of them. On top of that, they are stuffing themselves full of oestrogen and practically turning into girls. Is that Jeremy Clarkson I hear cheering?  Pity the male vegetarian. Female vegetarians such as myself have it easy. All we have to contend with is the occasional boyfriend who can't understand that the offer of a bacon sandwich loses its admittedly intense comic power the 300th time around. We also have to do a lot of lip-biting at dinner parties as someone finds out you are vegetarian and instantly launches into a spiel about how they would never eat 'cruel meat', just 'organic', presumably from a magical farm where no animal ever dies, and they are all saved at the last moment by an ingenious spider writing messages in her web.  However, that's about it for the female vegetarian as far as being hassled goes. For women, vegetarianism doesn't automatically mean unfeminine, unsexy and boring. If you are a female vegetarian and unsexy, unfeminine and boring, you managed that all by yourself. For the most part, female vegetarianism seems to be somehow lumped in with other baffling lady pursuits such as feminism, menstruation and 'getting' Sarah Jessica Parker, a case of: 'We'll put up with it, because you can't help it; after all, you're only girls.'  So pity the male vegetarian who needs real courage and fortitude, as he is battered from all sides by the incomprehension and ridicule of the world around him. On the one hand, he's bullied by the likes of Gordon Ramsay, increasingly the comedy Sgt Major of carnivores ('Eat this bacon, you 'orrible little man'). On the other, he's perceived as somehow unmanly (pasty, unsexy) by the ladies. Indeed, I have often thought that, if it weren't for Paul McCartney, the male vegetarian would be right up there with Lembit Opik as The Guy No One Wants To Be. What's more, is it my imagination, but, in terms of the perceived link between meat-eating and machismo, are things actually getting worse?  You only have to look at our TV food programmes to realise that the climate is changing. Once, merely cooking animals was deemed enough. These days, the chef must be sent out into the wild, armed only with a TV camera crew and an Ernest Hemingway delusion, to catch and kill the animal, bird or fish before our very eyes.  There is also a new TV fashion for keeping animals (chickens, pigs, lambs) in your back garden, as kind of quasi-pets, giving them names, letting the viewers get attached and, in the last episode, slaughtering them. A bit like the Blue Peter tortoise, only with increased viewing figures and blood.  Watching this, you ask: is this 'me, hunter' syndrome a man-thing? And of course it is. You don't see Nigella running amok through wildlife with a knife, while Delia gets her mince from a tin. And if killing your own stuff for the table is suddenly perceived to be sexy, the latest way of being über-male, is the male vegetarian doomed to be denounced as even less attractive, even more weedy, ever before? Well not necessarily.  When you think about it, soya is too ubiquitous for this Harvard report only to be directed at vegetarians. Moreover, hard times are coming for animals and those who rather like them. I have seen it suggested that the economic crisis may see a decrease in the expensive, ozone-ruinous farming of livestock. However, I fear that what will actually happen is that the world will simply become even crueller and more penny-pinching in its treatment of them.  In this hostile, ultra-macho, morally arid climate, to stand up and be counted as a male vegetarian must require cojones of immense size, much bigger balls, in fact, than your average carnivorous wimp, who just goes along with the crowd. So pity him no longer, for it could be that the male vegetarian is suddenly looking kind of sexy again. Forget Mick and his many bedmates - Charlie is my darling Well, I suppose we should be grateful that Mick Jagger's 65th birthday fell yesterday, on a Saturday. Otherwise, a lot of men probably wouldn't have made it to work, having slumped into a depression, racked with libidinal envy, after seeing all the double-page spreads dedicated to how many beauties Jagger has slept with over the years. Marianne, Bianca and Jerry of course. But also Carla Bruni, Brigitte Bardot, Marsha Hunt and just about every model who has ever hit the catwalk. Personally, I'm bemused. I've never met a woman who'd fancy Jagger in a fit and not only because, caught in the wrong light, he resembles something unspeakably horrible hanging from the belt of a cannibal. Ask around among women and it's Stones drummer Charlie Watts who's the man. I interviewed him once and, beautifully turned out, clearly still in love with Shirley, his wife of 40-odd years, he was a true prince. There'll never be any double pages of conquests for Charlie, just one huge photo of Shirley and, for my money, there's far more beauty in that fact than all of Mick's models put together. Still, men are dogs, so I guess they'll stick with feeling envious. All you gutted men out there may be cheered up to note that Patti Boyd, Uma Thurman and Milla Jovovich fought Mick off.  And that Angie Bowie didn't. A couple of lost pay packets and I'd be destitute too So what's the biggie with: 'Millions only 11 days from ruin'? The news that some people in Britain feel that they would only be able to survive for about 11 days if they lost their jobs, or were too ill to work, isn't news at all to some of us. I've spent my entire adult life feeling like I'm mere days away from ruin. In fact, 11 days is a result, much longer than I thought I'd get. The survey by the Yorkshire Building Society wasn't altogether bleak - the vast majority of Britons felt that they could go 52 days without encountering financial meltdown. Others clung to the belief that they could sell their homes if necessary, while still others admitted they had 'no idea' what they would do. One effect of all this may be to drive people's inner-tramp fear to the surface. Tramp fear is the sensation you get in your solar plexus that feels like violent indigestion but is actually the knowledge that, however hard you try in life, you are never more than a couple of pay packets away from sitting outside shops with a sign reading: 'Please give generously - two children and a Sky+ habit to support.' It is also the part of you that shivers in existential recognition at the people who walk past you in the street wearing 20 filthy cardigans and pushing old prams full of damp cardboard. Always give these people money and make it clear that you want them to blow the lot on booze and drugs. On a basic level, you and they are the same - you are both tramp people. They just got there first. Alternatively, as life insurance is still far cheaper than even the most basic salary protection, people may prefer to go down the Willy Loman Death of a Salesmen route. Since we took out policies on each other, it's been a strange sensation to realise: 'We're both worth a lot more to each other dead than alive.' (Pause.) 'A lot.' Oh nice. Should I expect a cushion over the face anytime soon? All of which makes one feel somewhat less damning of those dreary Darwins and their interminable Reggie Perrin escapades. For all the greed and the lies, not to mention the damn canoes, at least they didn't embark down another, far more slippery slope.",Barbara Ellen: It takes a real man to say he enjoys tofu,2008-07-26T23:01:00Z,Barbara Ellen,world
"What a missed opportunity. Christopher Ciccone, for years Madonna's backstage dresser, interior designer, show designer and, according to him, chief gofer and whipping boy, has gone on record saying that he hopes this memoir makes his famous big sister 'squirm'. So why not just go the whole hog and call it 'Sissie Dearest' and market it honestly as a misery memoir, an everyday tale of celebrity sibling abuse as suffered by poor Christopher at the hands of Madonna?  As it is, the tone is set early on as Christopher - young, gay, in awe - relates how, just as Madonna is about to go onstage on her Girlie Show tour: 'Out of habit, I hold out my palm, and she spits her Ricolo cough drop straight into it.' Seemingly unaware that this is not what they mean by the term 'right hand man', Christopher blithely muses that he is writing his book 'partly as my answer to the eternal question: ""What's it really like being Madonna's brother?""'  According to this book, the answer is a special kind of grovelling, sycophantic, resentful and ultimately self-inflicted hell, but the guest list goes some way towards making up for it. Cher, Donatella, Warren, Gwyneth, Kate, Naomi, Demi, Jack, Sting and Trudi - who didn't CC get to meet while he was being used by Madonna as a human spittoon?  Indeed, as an insider's riff on life in 'Madonna-world', this book could have been a gem, and no one could deny that Christopher had a front row seat. However, CC seems less interested in his sister or her accomplishments than he is in observing Madge with a kind of retro-malevolence, from her early loathing of the UK (who'd have thought she'd be back to play lady of the manor, crows Christopher) to the Malawi adoption of David ('She's in competition with Angelina Jolie').  Throughout, Madonna is depicted as a monster several shades less reasonable than Norma Desmond. Madonna abuses CC even as he wipes down her sweaty naked flanks as her tour dresser, a job he hates ('I never tell [friends] that I spend my time picking up her sweaty underwear'). She outs him in a media interview, uses their dead mother's grave as a 'movie location', constantly underpays him and undermines his attempts to be a 'creative person'. Despite this, when CC is not picking Madonna's knickers up off the floor, he spends most of his time obsessing over how she truly (TRULY) views their relationship. Here's an impartial view, Christopher: you Baldrick, she Blackadder.  And so it goes on. As someone who interviewed Madonna in the Nineties, I was definitely in the market for some insight as to how she went from zeitgeist-defining charmer to raging Kabbalah bore, but all we get here are faux-wistful remarks about how CC hopes 'Madonna realises Kabbalah's central message of selflessness'. When Guy Ritchie comes on the scene, CC is devastated, viewing Ritchie as the 'death knell' of his relationship with Madonna. (What? He thought it was good before?)  Sadly, Christopher's revelations of Ritchie's references to 'poofters' at the Skibo Castle wedding are not as explosive as he likes to think, most of us having realised that Ritchie is not the type to man the Judy Garland float at Gay Pride marches. The same applies to CC's endless diatribes on Madonna's self-obsession, control freakery, cheapness and attention seeking (which, frankly, we could have all guessed at anyway).  Indeed, what comes though strongest here is Christopher's own self-justifying victimhood, the bubbling Vesuvius of brotherly bile, particularly during his interminable whines about how his sister has underpaid him. Maybe someone should have taken Christopher aside and explained that just as you shouldn't shop for food when you're hungry, you shouldn't write a memoir about your mega-rich sister when you're broke. As it is, the money references are so numerous that this memoir could have easily been retitled, Jerry Springer style: 'Sis, you should have bought me more stuff.' This tome is worth buying for the sour and brilliant brother-sister email spats alone (Madonna seems to think Christopher is a drug addict, but I can't see why, as he raves endlessly and paranoically about his ill-treatment at her hands). However, Christopher is a bit naughty billing this as a Madonna book. In truth, it is an overlong, unintentionally hilarious essay on one brother's obsessive envy and resentment of his flawed but talented famous sister. As to the 'eternal question' of what it is like being Madonna's brother, throughout this book, the air resounds with the distant squelching sounds of a cash cow being vigorously milked. For Christopher, one feels, that is what being Madonna's brother is like.  · To order Life With My Sister Madonna for £16.99 with free UK p&p, go to observer.co.uk/bookshop or call 0870 836 0885",Review: Life With My Sister Madonna by Christopher Ciccone,2008-07-26T23:01:00Z,Barbara Ellen,review
"Forget the sport. As the Beijing Olympics goes critical for its August 8 opening, the political essence of this bizarre event becomes ever clearer. What is not clear is who will win, China or its critics. It could be a photo-finish. The International Olympic Committee originally chose China for two reasons: it knew it could rely on the Chinese regime to deliver on its stupefying budget; and it knew China would have a public relations interest in complying with the IOC's increasingly fantasist self-image.  China wanted the games for different reasons. As a dictatorship, it saw cost and control as no problem. The games would draw favourable world attention to its introverted and curiously insecure oligarchy. As the Xinhua press agency declared at the time of the award, getting the Olympics was ""another milestone in China's rising international status and a historical event in the great renaissance of the Chinese nation"". No nonsense there about sport.  Matters have moved on. China is spending a colossal sum of money, reputedly $40bn, on just a fortnight of sport. The Olympics area of Beijing has been destroyed and rebuilt with stadiums, office blocks and avenues: monuments to the cosmopolitan, modernising zeal of the Chinese communist party. Salivating western architects have lined up for work without a moral qualm. They include, appropriately, the genial son of Albert Speer to do the masterplan.  The message of the torch tour and the ""1,000 jogging policemen"" was that anything can happen when authority loses control. That will not be repeated. Tibet is virtually inaccessible. Activists of the emergent civil rights movement - concerned with anything from land reform to HIV/Aids - have been thrown into jail. Any domestic criticism has been suppressed, and the signers of a petition demanding ""an Olympic spirit"" in human rights silenced.  Foreigners have been evicted from the neighbourhood of the Olympic site. The Chinese press remains censored, and woe betide any visiting journalist who steps out of the tightly drawn line. The American network NBC, with exclusive rights to the games, is owned by General Electric, which has extensive commercial interests in China. Spitting has been banned and 100,000 troops brought in to ring the city.  Britain's IOC member, Sir Craig Reedie, hilariously declared that the IOC's contract is ""with the host city, it does not become involved in politics"". Why then the IOC's frequent references to human rights? It is all humbug. Tourists have understandably stayed away. The 119 Olympic five-star hotels are only 78% full, booked almost entirely with games officials financed by some taxpayer somewhere. According to the Beijing authorities, tourist four-star hotels are just 45% full, with overall visitor numbers currently 20% down on the same month last year. Given the number of official visitors, this must mean a total collapse in private tourism.  This should surprise nobody. It is an open secret that both Athens and Sydney did not gain but lost on their tourist account through hosting the Olympics. Normal visitors avoid Olympic cities for fear of crowds. The related downswing in block bookings can take years to return to normal. Australia admitted as much with its subsequent travel slogan, ""Where the bloody hell are you?""  People who say the games make money, except for builders and consultants, are talking rubbish. They are the greatest public spending hit on Earth. Nor for nothing are Britain's Olympics officials taking their bonuses in six-figure salaries, rather than waiting for Lord Coe's promised ""profit"". They are outrageously paying tens of millions of pounds to ""cost-cutting"" consultants - all beyond the reach of meaningful audit.  The Chinese have shrewdly taken the view that the popularity of the games is not an issue. What matters is the avoidance of nasty incidents broadcast to the world. Hence the clampdown on visas, even for bona fide tourists. If you want to go to China at present, say you work for the BBC, the IOC's greatest cheerleader, with a reported 150 staff on the junket of their lives. Over three-quarters of the tickets have been allocated to Chinese, to ensure there are no embarrassing empty seats on camera, as there were at Athens four years ago.  At this point in the argument, China can justifiably crow. It has given two fingers to the IOC. It has pressed an army of builders into ensuring it delivers the project on time. It has reneged on its pledge, which the IOC formally announced, that the games would ""help the development of human rights in China"". Why should they? As the China pundit Mark Leonard has pointed out, the undoubted liberalisation of the Chinese economy and lifestyle in recent years has been paralleled by ""an increasingly sophisticated control of the public sphere ... not western-style democracy but a hi-tech model of deliberative dictatorship"".  But if China is winning the sprints, it has yet to get the marathon in the bag. The spotlight that is planned to bathe Beijing in Olympic glory is not as biddable as in the past. The security operation designed to turn China into a giant television studio is itself receiving adverse publicity.  The political cliche that dictatorship cannot censor every blog, mobile phone and digital camera holds true. China may discourage the world's public from coming to the games with its visas and repression, but it cannot ensure that no rogue journalists get through, least of all when tens of thousands of them are in town. This is, after all, the media event of the year. Tibet has already garnered enough global publicity from the Olympics to incur the envy of every oppressed minority. After a decade in which Beijing has won only sycophancy from the world's political, financial and media community, it is now enduring much hostile comment - and for no other reason than the staging of the games. For all the nonsense talked of the ""Olympic legacy"" - usually an unusable out-of-town wilderness - the true legacy of Beijing will be not sporting or architectural but political. The games are essentially of minority sports, which is why the IOC have always built them up as celebrations of world chauvinism, and why China (and now Britain) must be seduced with glory into spending so much money on them. If electronic communication can ruffle the well-oiled feathers of the communist/IOC apparat, if brave Chinese can defy those who oppress them in the name of world harmony and if journalists can break loose from their freebies and do a proper job, then the decision to go to China might be vindicated. Soft power will have scored a win. We might hear less of the thesis that you can buy off freedom with bread and a $40bn circus.  These are big ifs, but by no means impossible. Whether it needed so much money and effort to reveal the true nature of the Beijing regime to the wider world I cannot say. That question is still open. But it makes me wonder what murky side of Britain may be exposed in the same glare in 2012. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com",This circus of minority sports is a PR triumph for a brutal regime - so far,2008-07-24T23:01:00Z,Simon Jenkins,world
"The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Monday July 28 2008  Croatia has not joined the EU as we said in a comment piece headed: The concept of international justice will be on trial, too. It has been an official candidate for membership since 2004.    The capture of Radovan Karadzic is unqualified good news. Despite yesterday's queue of Balkan pundits eager to destroy any hope of his getting an unadulterated trial, he was half the duumvirate that oversaw the worst atrocities committed on European soil in half a century. The other half, Ratko Mladic, is still on the run. Quite what Karadzic's defence might be is obscure, unless it is that brutality, revenge and the fog of war have long been commonplace in the Balkans. It is not an argument that will appeal to the thousan ds of Muslim and Croat victims of his fraudulent Serbian Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Atrocities also committed against Serbs by Croats, notably in Krajina, in no way excuse the systematic Serb killings, especially in Sarajevo and Srebrenica. That Karadzic and Mladic have roamed free for 13 years since their indictment by The Hague tribunal in 1995 has been a disgrace both to the international rulers of Bosnia, including Britain's Paddy Ashdown, and to Serbia itself. But now, with a newly elected government in power, a sort of closure is in sight. Visitors to Belgrade during the 1990s were baffled by the contrast between the European civility of its Serb citizens and their blank refusal to see wrong in what was happening in their name in the federated states of Bosnia and Kosovo. It was like the dismissive attitude of many Britons to colonial peoples in Africa and Asia. After the fall of Tito's communism, the Yugoslav cosmopolis disintegrated into its former parts. The release of hatred was appalling. All who care for peace in the Balkans must now hope that Serbia can put the past behind it. It has paid an awful price for voting for Milosevic in 1990, including the recent loss of Kosovo and Montenegro. It has had to watch regional neighbours such as Slovenia, Croatia and Bulgaria join the European Union while its European credentials remained beyond the pale. This year the Serbs rejected, admittedly by a narrow margin, a return to introspective chauvinism, electing a president and government of pro-western inclinations. The early capture of Karadzic may well have been precipitated by the prospect of European enlargement coming to a halt after the Irish veto. Serbs may not desperately want the EU, but they desperately want to be loved. Not only Karadzic and Serbia are now on trial. So is the concept of international justice at The Hague, reduced to bureaucratic farce by the handling of Slobodan Milosevic in 2002. That trial was supranational jurisdiction at its most flatulent and inert, a monument to the maxim that slow justice is no justice. The prosecution case took three years, and by the end in 2006, both the judge and the defendant were dead. What the court really achieved in the case of Milosevic and the 44 other Serbs brought to trial must be moot. He died in captivity, but the process did much to stir fury among the Serbs that Croats and Kosovans - who could be no less cruel in their ethnic cleansing - had got off lightly at The Hague. The case for war crimes justice in its present internationalised form remains in question. A burgeoning army of jurists points out that ""international"" crime against humanity is a meaningful concept and that many countries lack the security or the competence to conduct criminal trials, which is true. They also claim that the prospect of a Hague indictment deters the worst of dictators from the worst of atrocities, though it is hard to see this deterrence in practice. Defenders of the international criminal court in The Hague also protest its infancy. As the lawyer Geoffrey Robertson has written: ""It has been a long and difficult struggle, legal, political and diplomatic, to hold political and military leaders accountable for crimes against humanity."" The concept of impunity for atrocities within sovereign states is now an acknowledged wrong but, says Robertson, it is one that will take time to establish.  This defence is wearing thin. It may well be that the world needs a lofty tribunal to enforce agreed standards of behaviour in war, and to call dictators to account. But every murder is a crime against humanity. The glamour of Nuremburg still hovers over a process that has become bureaucratic and trespasses on conflicts that should be dealt with nationally. It is tempting to add that international lawyers who so conspicuously fail to put their professional house in order can hardly expect sceptical statesmen to give them free rein. The existence of The Hague is said to have complicated peace negotiations in Zimbabwe, Congo, Uganda and Sudan. Leaders are reluctant to step down from power without a promise of immunity from extradition to a Dutch jail. Meanwhile, war trials in Latin America, Iraq and Cambodia have taken place within the jurisdiction of the relevant states, where they are regarded as more satisfactory than under the aegis of formerly imperialist Europeans. It is always better for a nation to seek atonement within itself, as many Serbs wanted in the case of Milosevic. He was handed over in 2002 by Serbia's leaders in the hope of vast subsidies from EU membership, which did not materialise. Local justice might be rougher and tougher, but it compels warring parties to confront their past actions on their own territory, and before their own people. Such domestic ""restorative justice"" is a surer way to reconciliation. Karadzic should have faced his own people. His removal to The Hague is about barter not justice. This tragedy is the outcome of a process of Balkanisation, in which the west was a bumbling but willing partner - as it is in Iraq and Afghanistan. The arrival of western troops and politicians in a country appears to be the inevitable precursor to partition. Governments that resist decentralisation within their own borders become ardent defenders of ""plucky little"" Kurdistan, Kosovo and Montenegro, and doubtless one day plucky Helmand, Waziristan and Baluchistan. It is the easiest way to be ""doing something"". The best that can be said for such partition is that it brings short-term peace. In this case, Serbia has played ball. It has served its time in purgatory and its long-term stability is crucial to the future of the Balkans. The west now has a clear interest in opening up its trade and helping it on to its feet. That cannot begin too soon. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com","Simon Jenkins: The concept of international justice will be on trial, too",2008-07-22T23:01:00Z,Simon Jenkins,world
"It's lucky Barack Obama has people to carry his bags these days, because when he arrived in Israel last night he brought with him a whole lot of baggage. Most of it was packed with negative associations that owe more to urban myth than reality, but that combined to make the Democratic candidate an object of suspicion from the earliest days of his campaign, first among American Jews and then in Israel. The mix of facts, lies and hybrids of the two is now wearily familiar: Barack Hussein Obama is a Muslim; he was educated in a madrasa; he has terrorist friends; his former pastor is an Israel-hater and admirer of the anti-Jewish Louis Farrakhan; he was against the war on Iraq, wants to talk to Iran - and will therefore fall to his knees to appease Israel's enemies. The Obama camp has worked hard to dump all this cargo, but it has been stubborn to shift. Opinion polls show that US Jewry's traditional three-to-one backing for the Democrats remains intact, with most supporting Obama. But while the Illinois senator can look forward to a euphoric response in Berlin tomorrow night, and in London and Paris thereafter, Israel is one of the few places where he faces a hostile, or at least uncertain, public. Recent polls have Israelis backing John McCain over Obama, just as they preferred Hillary Clinton a few months back. The people answering those surveys may well have made up their minds some 18 months ago, when the novice senator told a handful of Iowa voters that ""No one is suffering more than the Palestinians"". That single line crystallised the view that Obama, who had once dined with the late Palestinian-American intellectual Edward Said, would be chilly to Israel were he ever to reach the White House.  The result is that the Israel-Palestine leg of Obama's current world tour will be the trickiest, placing him under the closest scrutiny. He will be watched not only by Israelis and Arabs in the region, but by their cheerleaders back home in the US, looking for any misstep, any sign of a new tilt towards one side or the other. Not that friends of the Palestinians have high hopes for true evenhandedness. They have seen the way Obama has sought to dismantle that earlier image of himself by swearing his granite support for Israel. With some ingenuity, he even recast the soundbite that had got him in such trouble, declaring: ""Nobody has suffered more than the Palestinian people from the failure of the Palestinian leadership to recognise Israel."" So a second position has arisen, which holds that, far from ushering in a new approach - one that would see Washington willing to lean on Israel - a President Obama would bend over backwards to prove his pro-Israel credentials. There was no clearer illustration than the speech he gave to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee last month, the morning after he had bagged the Democratic nomination. He hymned his admiration for and belief in the Jewish state. He declared: ""Jerusalem will remain the capital of Israel."" And then, though his audience was already on its feet applauding, fully satisfied, he added: ""And it must remain undivided.""  With those extra five words, Obama - buddy of Edward Said and bearer of an Arabic middle name - had put himself to the right of the Israeli government. Ever since the failed Camp David talks of 2000, it has been mainstream Israeli thinking that Jerusalem would have to serve as the capital of both Israel and an eventual Palestinian state. Negotiations currently under way between the two sides doubtless take that as read. Yet here was a candidate for president forbidding any such compromise.  Predictably, and in the face of Palestinian outrage, Obama had to row back from the remark, thereby irritating the very pro-Israel forces he had been so eager to please. The end result was to delight the McCain team - who insisted again yesterday that Obama is ""frighteningly inexperienced"" and woefully naive - but also to confirm the worst fears of the most extreme elements in both the pro-Israel and pro-Palestine camps. It was the Israel-pandering hawk who made the Jerusalem promise - and the Arab-loving appeaser who withdrew it.  Which one of these men is the real Barack Obama? The answer is neither. For one thing, both figures were always holograms, projections from fevered, partisan imaginations. Sure, Obama had expressed sympathy for the Palestinians - but so, if not often, has George W Bush. It didn't, and doesn't, make the senator a card-carrying member of Hamas.  Nor do his recent efforts to assure Israel of his support, which will doubtless grow yet more poetic and effusive today, make Obama the soul brother of Binyamin Netanyahu. They are, let's be clear, part of a broader effort by Obama to tack to the centre, in the time-honoured fashion of all nominees emerging from the internal battle of party primaries. If he has a more centrist position on the Middle East, that's only because he also has a more centrist position on gun control and corporate taxation.  The less lurid reality is that Obama is a down-the-line US Democrat - and firm support for Israel comes with that territory. On that simple metric, there will be no change. But that does not leave him indistinguishable from McCain. On the contrary, clear differences are there (chiefly on talking to Iran) - and most point in a direction that should be welcomed by those who yearn for Middle East peace.  First, Obama will today show a basic respect for the Palestinians that somehow eluded his Republican opponent: the Democrat will visit Ramallah, which McCain skipped when he came to the region in March. Second, Obama is honest enough to admit that the Israel-Palestine conflict does at least contribute to instability in the region, while McCain sees no source of trouble except ""radical Islamic terrorism"".  Above all, Obama promises to do, once more, the work that a US administration alone can do - engaging hands-on, directly and every day, in shepherding the two sides through negotiations and towards peace. Bill Clinton toiled in this way until his last hours in office; Bush, by contrast, steered well clear of the whole messy business until last autumn, when he panicked that he might have no other legacy to point to. Obama has faulted both Clinton and Bush for getting stuck in too late. Yesterday, in Amman, he vowed to roll up his sleeves, ""from the minute I'm sworn into office"".  But Obama is sending a signal more powerful than mere words. Accompanying him on this trip is Dennis Ross, the veteran mediator who served both Clinton and Bush's father. Ross has his critics, but no one doubts his knowledge or experience. ""I see him as the diplomatic equivalent of Michael Jordan working the Middle East,"" says David Makovsky, a colleague of Ross's at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, which is neutral in all elections. ""He has the skill and the finesse."" With Ross at his side, Obama is signalling that we should forget the myth-making: an Obama presidency will be about active, engaged diplomacy, between Israelis and Palestinians, between Israel and Syria, and beyond. And if anyone doubts that this is what the world desperately needs after the past seven and a half years, then they haven't been paying attention. freedland@theguardian.com",Jonathan Freedland: Forget the myth-making.

"Twenty years ago, Barbara Ehrenreich wrote an article for the New York Times in which she pointed out the growing inequality of American society and was promptly denounced, by a rival paper, as a Marxist. ""The Washington Times is an extreme-rightwing publication,"" she says, so there was no surprise there. But the paper's reaction underlined a general principle: that while one can say ""fairly wild"" things about race and gender in the US, there persists a certain coyness about class. ""There's this powerful myth that America doesn't have classes; that they're an ancient English or European thing that we abolished. And that if you're not rich, it's your own damn fault."" Now 66, Ehrenreich has devoted most of her career to disproving this maxim. Her 2001 bestseller Nickel and Dimed was an account of the year she spent trying to eke out an existence on the minimum wage, which caused affluent readers everywhere to exclaim guiltily: ""We had no idea!"" She reported that companies cheat their staff of wages (there are 70 lawsuits pending); limit the number of toilet breaks staff take; forbid them from talking to each other or using ""profanity"" on the premises, and that the cleaner you hired through a ""reputable"" firm is probably made to clean your house while sick or injured. The book's success owed much to the personal journey of Ehrenreich herself, who suggested the idea to her editor for a younger journalist to take on. But she fitted the profile of the invisible worker - middle-aged, female and knackered. Once in situ, she was bullied by various bosses and forced to retire each night to a motel because she couldn't afford a flat. Her latest book, which in the US is called This Land Is Their Land: Reports from a Divided Nation, is the animating force behind all this, a collection of columns that almost amounts to a manifesto. The title comes from a Woody Guthrie song, which Ehrenreich can hardly bear to listen to these days. She writes: ""I flinch when I hear Woody Guthrie's line, 'This land belongs to you and me'. Somehow, I don't think it was meant to be sung by a chorus of hedge-fund operators."" (The book's UK publisher evidently didn't feel Guthrie's song travelled well, and has opted for the title Going to Extremes instead.) Ehrenreich's skill, apart from the sheer quality of her writing, is to illustrate her opinions with wave after wave of examples, of unglamorous labour disputes and everyday injustices that don't get much of a look-in elsewhere. Through them she details how wealth in America has transferred from the bottom to the top, thanks to tax cuts for the rich and Bush's reluctance to regulate the markets, and exposes the fallacy that ""growth"" as measured by GDP is, for the majority of Americans, synonymous with better living. ""It was just so fascinating to me, without being an economist, to see how in the past few years growth has become completely decoupled from wages or the real conditions of what we call working people,"" she says. ""And the reason they were so decoupled is because of the huge inequality. So you could have many [economic] indicators looking very sunny and good, but you're talking about a population that is so divided there's not an average there any more."" A book about the joylessness of the American right must struggle to avoid matching it with a litany of dreary, rival orthodoxies. But Ehrenreich has never been dour, nor for that matter predictable. She lives in the historic town of Alexandria, just south of Washington DC, in a jolly chaos of papers and magazines. On the mantelpiece is a card that reads, ""I am not, therefore I buy"", but she is as suspicious of self-denial as she is of self-indulgence, both of which she sees as affectations. In one unexpected column, Ehrenreich flies at Jane Brody, the health editor of the New York Times, who throughout the 90s championed with great influence the virtues of a low-fat, high-carb diet. As well as questioning the health benefits of Brody's principles, Ehrenreich calls them a way of enabling the well-off to feel virtuous merely by indulging their own narcissism. ""The low-fat diet has been the hair shirt under the fur coat - the daily deprivation that offsets the endless greed."" The ""tireless preaching"" that bedevils modern life elicits a resounding screw-you from Ehrenreich. Her latest bugbear is ""positive thinking"", the underlying philosophy of much life coaching and motivational speaking, which she came across during the research for Bait and Switch, the follow-up to Nickel and Dimed. In it, she spent a year trying to expose white-collar office life but was scuppered by not being able to get a job. Instead Ehrenreich fell into the hands of the gannets who feed on the unemployed and sell them reassurances that getting a job is just a question of attitude. This was illustrated by cheerful Kimberly, a ""co-active coach"" whom Ehrenreich employed and ended up wanting to kill. As the economy recedes, you wonder if Kimberly and her ilk will disappear. ""I tend to think that the irrational, delusional approaches will persist,"" she warns. Ehrenreich is by training a scientist, with a degree in chemistry and a PhD in cell biology. As a child she saw both sides of the economic divide. Her father was a copper miner from Montana who got an education and eventually qualified as a metallurgist and made it on to the corporate ladder at Gillette. ""He was a very exceptional person, as he'd be the first to tell you. But he never - nor did my mother - say about people who didn't do as well, 'Oh we did it, so they can do it.' They recognised that theirs was an unusual trajectory."" Did they identify as working-class? ""No. I think they would have said middle-class. But I think my father always thought that he didn't fit in. He was too rough-edged. And he had a lot of contempt for, say, Ivy League types or MBA types."" What she sees as the stigmatisation of the sick in the US is a reaction in part to a ""strange little detail"" of her childhood. Her mother, who was politically more radical than her father and whom the young Ehrenreich would look at in alarm sometimes and wonder if she was a communist, had been brought up by her Christian Scientist grandparents. ""And in no other way was my mother continuing to be a Christian Scientist, except for one thing: health. It was very bad to get sick. I remember when I had trouble seeing the blackboard in about seventh grade, she said, ""People in our family don't wear glasses."" Ehrenreich smiles ruefully. Her son is a writer and her daughter a lawyer, (Ehrenreich is divorced; she moved to Alexandria to be near her two grandchildren) and half of her family still lives on low wages; her sister and her husband have just been forced to cancel their health insurance. I wonder if she had ethical qualms about Nickel and Dimed; isn't there something unsavoury about a comfortable journalist pretending to be poor and then being paid a lot of money to write about it? ""Well you know, that never entered my mind . . . what began to bother me a little bit was that there was a deception involved; that I had to tell people that I was working these jobs because I needed the money, which wasn't true. But I always tried at the end to tell people I had got to know what the truth was. And then you can work off the guilt of any money by giving it away. Easily fixed."" Until the success of that book she had been freelance, and the security, she says, has been wonderful. She hasn't had a staff position since her first job working for the New York City government as a health planner, which she left after seven months when she decided that ""the government was selling out to private interests"" and went to work for a ""radical collective"" lobbying for better healthcare in the city. ""That's where I started writing, because we had a newsletter and I loved to do investigative pieces."" Nowadays, people write to Ehrenreich with their workplace horror stories. The most shocking in the new book came from an ex-employee of one large retailer, who told Ehrenreich that in 2003 the company held him captive for six hours and interrogated him for giving a colleague a discount on a videogame, before getting him to write a false confession and firing him. A former colleague alleged that such incidents were not unusual. With Obama ascending there is hope of a sea change, although Ehrenreich remains characteristically cautious. She sees him ""tacking to the right"" and was disheartened by his choice of economic adviser, Jason Furman, ""who was to the far right of the Democratic party and made his reputation as a defender of Wal-Mart [one of her principal targets in Nickel and Dimed]. And so in a way, I thought, OK, I'm not going to pay [Obama] any attention for a while."" I wonder if the huge success of Nickel and Dimed, and the tax bill that presumably came with it, hasn't sent Ehrenreich skidding off a bit in that direction. ""Ha! I have to watch that kind of stuff. But no. I always say, if I could pay more taxes and be in turn told for sure that there would be decent schools for my grandchildren, that there would be healthcare for them, that there would be social security, if there was something in return, other than wars, it would be a wonderful thing."" She cackles.

"There will be much jostling for position in the chancelleries of Europe and the Middle East this week, as political types from London to Jerusalem compete for the hottest ticket of 2008: the chance to sit down with Barack Obama. David Cameron's team wasted no time in bellowing their delight that they had bagged a meeting with the Democrats' anointed leader, scheduled for July 26, announcing it before Downing Street had so much as opened itsmouth. The distracted newspaper reader could be forgiven for thinking that Obama is crossing the Atlantic solely to meet the leader of the Conservative party, leaving Gordon Brown out in the cold. There'll be versions of that little drama played out everywhere the Democratic nominee goes on his grand tour, as local pols compete like kids in the playground to show that they're Obama's bestest best friend. What of the rest of us? The US media is assuming that we'll be turning out in massive numbers, all but throwing street parades for the new American saviour. Setting the bar high, Obama's team is said to be encouraging parallels between the candidate's upcoming visit to Germany and John F Kennedy's legendary Ich Bin Ein Berliner address in 1963. Obviously a warm reception can only be good for the Illinois senator. But maybe not that warm. After all, one of the hoariest Republican attack lines deployed against Democratic opponents is that they are vaguely foreign, somehow more comfortable abroad, and therefore likely to put America's interests second – after those of their elitist friends in Europe. Remember the Republican nickname for the Democratic nominee of 2004? They called him ""Jean Cherie"". If Europeans really want to help Barack Obama next week they should repress their enthusiasm for him – and stay home. Ensure those crowds are thin and lethargic; maybe even offer the odd heckle, perhaps while brandishing a hostile placard. Let the travelling US press report that Obama is not so popular with foreigners after all: nothing will endear him more to the American public. For those non-Americans finding it hard to feign coolness towards the Democratic candidate, let me offer two thoughts. First, as I discussed here, Obama is already tacking towards the centre, away from positions comfortable to Europeans and others. Second, the Nixon to China syndrome works both ways: just as Republicans can afford to risk looking soft towards those deemed America's enemies, so Democrats have to bend over backwards to seem tough. All the pressure would be on a President Obama to prove he was not some patsy appeaser, perhaps by staging an early demonstration of American muscularity. If it helps, bear all that in mind when Obama hits your neighbourhood. Remember, if you want him to win in November, do your duty – and do nothing.",Jonathan Freedland: Obama must curb our enthusiasm,2008-07-20T15:00:00Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"On Monday evening the former prime minister Margaret Thatcher attended a private concert in London at St John's, Smith Square. She was a magnificent apparition, arriving in dying sunlight and guided to her seat like Turner's Fighting Temeraire, masts and spars still ghostly proud and with attendant tugs fussing round her. Thatcher was also attended by the Furies that continue to afflict her reputation. They were roused this time by reports that she is to be accorded a ""£3m state funeral"" as and when she dies. While Gordon Brown's admiration for her is one of the few sentiments he shares with Tony Blair, there is something ghoulish in publicly discussing the death of the living. It speaks volumes of Downing Street's present state of mind. Were Thatcher discomfited by reading of her demise, her spirits will have been raised by the reaction from the left. As the New Statesman and Guardian letters page erupted in stereotypical rage, the lady's nostrils must have sniffed the cordite and her sinews responded nostalgically to the sound of battle. In the Statesman the playwright Ed Waugh denounced Thatcher's ""unprecedented attack on the living standards and democratic rights of working people"". What, he asked, of the ""selfless miners ... and heroic Liverpool councillors""? A state funeral (surely of no concern to the left) would be ""an unforgivable betrayal of Labour voters"". The same psalmody was chanted in unison by Guardianistas entombed in some prison of the 1980s mind. The lady was ""loathed and despised by a large proportion of UK citizens"". Who could forget ""savage cuts to the public sector"", not to mention ""loads of money"" and ""no such thing as society""? The writers suggested variously that the funeral go to the lowest bidder, take place in Port Stanley, or be attended by ""ex-miners, just to make sure she has gone"". Harold Macmillan remarked of the political biographer Philip Guadella that the prospect of a posthumous biography by him ""added a new terror to death"". The same might apply to debating the funeral arrangements of the great and good. Whoever thought they were doing Thatcher a favour in revealing these plans was misguided. It may be bad form to speak ill of the dead, but no such restriction applies to the living, however old and infirm. These wounds remain bleeding. Up and down the country, adherents of the old religion gather in the Hatton Arms and toast the Scargill over the water. They tell their tales of glory, of flying pickets and discontented winters. Eyes water at the mention of Orgreave and Wapping. They were good times, companionable times, and ""she"" was the architect of it all. Not for such warriors TS Eliot's admonition that ""We cannot revive old factions ... Or follow an antique drum."" Where would they be without Thatcher? She defined them when a broken Labour party fled the battlefield. Blair bears no comparison as a figure of hate, a feeble acolyte whose curse is hardly worth a smashed glass in the fireplace. The very name of Thatcher evokes fury two decades after her fall. Her potency is massive. She jeered the ""socialists"" and she faced them down. She defied them in the courts, on the picket line and at the hustings. She kept winning elections. She embodied the Manichean politics of the grand old days. I can hear the hoary militants crying: please keep her around, let her not go yet. Of course, Thatcher should not have a state funeral, and I cannot believe she would want one. Such funerals are for heads of state, or occasionally for those who saved the state from catastrophe in war, for a Nelson, a Wellington or a Churchill. Even Churchill's funeral did not evoke universal assent. He was regarded by many as is Thatcher by the Guardian. But he embodied and unified the nation in its hour of peril. His funeral was a moment of recollected gratitude. Victory in war delivers a salving balm to the reputation of a leader. No such balm is available in time of peace, even if victory requires greater leadership and skill, and the facing down of implacable foes. Yet no serious historian could deny that Thatcher's coming to power in 1979 ""saved Britain"" in a realistic sense. It began a transformation in its political economy and, for the overwhelming majority of Britons, it was a change for the better. The human costs were high, not least those imposed by Geoffrey Howe's savage ""restructuring"" budgets of 1980 and 1981. But the privatising of the public trading sector and the freeing of markets in labour and capital jolted Britain from laggard to leader among European economies. Whatever the downsides, this was the challenge that had defied the failed governments of the 70s and that Thatcher accepted and met. Others in Europe have yet to match her radicalism, and they know it. There was no greater testament to this than that Labour and the Liberal Democrats should have adopted Thatcherism in all material respects in the 1990s. The protesters can complain that under Thatcher ""market forces guided every aspect of British life"", but she was more timid at being Thatcherite, and with probably more generous safety nets, than Blair and Brown. She refused point blank to privatise the coal mines, the railways and the post office. She would not have privatised virtually all public investment, as has Brown so extravagantly. Thatcher was a streetwise politician who achieved her goal by fierce partisanship and a refusal to compromise. She revelled in argument and thrived on conflict. Only her thickness of skin, especially to opponents within her own ranks, kept her on course. She never pretended to ""one nation"" consensus, and would have been appalled had her tormentors on the left agreed with her. I have often wondered why newspapers publish obituaries only after the death of the subject. Pre-death publication, say on retirement, would enable old friends to pay their tributes, personally or in print. More important, it would give the subject that most precious concomitant of free speech, the right of reply. How much more fun would it be if the victim were permitted a last chance to rebut his or her critics, a last speech for the defence, before the final bar of history. Thatcher is sadly past it now, but she would surely have preferred a rumbustious salute to her political legacy over a ponderous state funeral. Even on Monday I could sense her mental guns still ranging the sky in search of prey. She is an East Midlands Methodist at heart, not a state functionary. Her mark on history is great and merits due celebration, but it should honour a revolutionary political leader, not a figure of state. Thatcher's legacy deserves an oration, not a gun carriage. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com",Simon Jenkins: This hate figure doesn't merit a state funeral. All she did was rescue Britain,2008-07-17T23:01:00Z,Simon Jenkins,politics
"A couple of ministers were chatting after yesterday's cabinet, testing each other's historical knowledge with a brainteaser. Could they think of a politician, in this or any other country, who had suffered massive unpopularity inflicted by an economic downturn - only to recover and win an election? They briefly considered Denis Healey's stewardship through the crisis of 1976, which might have rescued Labour - had the winter of discontent not intervened in 1978-9 - but didn't. The ministers scratched their heads. (They could have considered Margaret Thatcher, who survived the recession of 1981 to win in 1983.)  It doesn't take a mind-reader to work out why ministers were asking such a question. ""I don't know a single Labour MP who thinks we can win the next election,"" reports one former minister, adding that the mood in the party has gone from ""gloomy to absolute fatalism"" in just the past two or three weeks. The sense that the government has sunk to a depth from which no previous administration has ever recovered has not faded since the despondency of Crewe and Nantwich. Tearoom talk of a new leader continues to cross the party's factional divides. The hole is still there and Labour are still at the bottom of it.  What, then, is the view from Downing Street? Conversations with the prime ministerial circle supply an answer which is certainly admirable, if not quite reassuring.  The good news is that there is no Bush-style state of denial: Gordon Brown confronts the morning newspapers each day, knows that he is unpopular and accepts that, in times like these, he will be blamed for everything. Downing Street recognises that it has made some terrible mistakes, none greater than the 10p tax issue, and that with food and fuel prices rising, and standards of living falling, voters are bound to feel livid with a government in office for 11 years.  But Team Brown does not believe that all this necessarily spells defeat. For one thing, they say, the current context is artificial. Brown tells friends that this is ""the age of the permanent referendum"", in which the news media, on an absurdly accelerated cycle, are constantly reaching a verdict on the government - and since the judgment this hour can't be the same as it was 60 minutes earlier, it has to get worse. Come 2010, and a general election, it won't be like that. It will not be a referendum but a choice: Labour or Conservative. And that will be a much more even contest.  Because that will be the moment, predicts the Brown circle, when the Tories will be found out. Voters will see that the Conservative conversion to social justice is shallow, nothing like the tectonic shift on market economics undertaken by New Labour. (""Where is their Clause Four moment?"") Britons will see through the spin and PR tricks, the policy headlines tossed out by former News of the World editor and Tory communications chieftain Andy Coulson. They will ask, where's the beef? They will react to David Cameron's Glasgow East speech last week, in which he called for the poor and obese to take greater responsibility, the same way Brown himself did, asking: where's the policy? All of this will become clearer as an election nears, say the Brownites, whether it's the enduring Tory divisions on Europe or the absence of a Conservative analysis of the global economic crisis. And just wait for Brown to renew the case he made in 2001 and 2005: Labour investment v Tory cuts. (Downing Street already estimates that the Conservatives have promised £12bn in tax cuts, which will have to be paid for somehow).  This line of attack will work, say the Brown circle, because the country has not made the ideological shift rightwards that occurred in, say, 1979. Then the nation was truly fed up with union power and much of the Labour settlement. But no such shift has happened now. On the contrary, the current Cameron attempt to present himself as compassionate, modern and progressive is proof that he believes Britain's centre of gravity remains on the centre-left.  As for the economy, yes, the government has more explaining to do, but the public is not stupid. It understands that the downturn is not Labour's fault, but a function of vast global forces - a ""perfect storm"" created by a tripling of the oil price coinciding with an unprecedented shaking of the financial system - that are beyond its control. When it comes to a choice, voters will see the sense in sticking with the weather-beaten helmsman, Brown, rather than the smooth-cheeked Cameron.  It all hinges, the Brownites argue, on voters realising that the prime minister is not only determined to steer the country through the current turbulence, but that he grasps the larger, longer-term picture and is acting accordingly. He knows that the only enduring answer to the high price of oil is to reduce demand for it, and that means creating alternative sources of energy. In this way, globalisation - which, incidentally, will require a rebuilding of the world's financial architecture, since neither the G8 nor the World Bank ""can survive in their present form"" while ""the IMF is completely irrelevant"" - and climate change come together. Brown sees this vast horizon: Cameron and the others can barely glimpse it. So much for the world as seen from Downing Street's window. Does any of it stack up? Brown is surely right that the Tories' conversion is not comparable to New Labour's, but he is wrong to assume that will doom Tory chances. Sometimes elections are referendums on the government rather than a choice between them and the opposition: 1997 was just such a plebiscite. Similarly, to fault the Conservatives for a lack of policy detail is probably to misread how voters make up their minds: how many really choose governments on the basis of which party has the more rigorous analysis? But the larger problem is surely that, while the global forces Brown describes may well be ""generational"" in their scope, politics works on a shorter timescale. He talks of projects - pushing the Gulf states to realise that the world will not be solely reliant on oil for much longer, thanks in part to nuclear power - that could take 20 years to bear fruit. Yet he needs to show results in 18 months if he is to have a chance of re-election.  It is an unforgiving thought, that Brown, who has spent a quarter-century fixated either on the immediate short-term - that night's headline on the evening news - or the distant long-term, could be undone by the space in between, the medium term where elections are won and lost. His allies insist he is doing plenty for the two-year period just ahead of us: note the package of housing measures due later today. They further argue that even long-term action might have a near-term effect: the way the oil markets work, if the world started moving towards renewables now, the oil price would begin to slide.  But this is the case he now has to prove, that he understands not only the ultra-micro and the super-macro, the very short-term and the very long-term, but the place where Britons actually live. Or else, as that former minister puts it bleakly, ""In the long term, the government's dead - and the Labour party with it."" freedland@theguardian.com","Jonathan Freedland: Short-term he gets, and long-term, too.

"Ah - there's nothing like a tragic love story. And indeed what follows is nothing like a tragic love story. For, if you listen carefully, you may just be able to catch the sound of high-end scuttling from the other side of the pond. That would be the Manhattan rats leaving the sinking ships or sinking husbands - pretty much the same thing.  It appears that the credit crunch has sent top-flight New York divorce business rocketing, up 40 per cent, as the trophy wives of Wall Street's beleaguered super-wealthy (executives, hedge funders, property developers) race to lawyers to cite 'irreconcilable differences', which in this case roughly translates as: 'He's poor now.'  It's got so bad that some Wall Street husbands are trying to hang on to their wives by taking out huge loans to maintain their mansions, yachts and Saks accounts. However, lawyers are saying that wives aren't interested in standing by their men, opting instead to end their marriages as quickly and clinically as a bad credit card snipped in half in front of you in a restaurant. The whole debacle amounts to a somewhat ruthless: 'If the gravy train is over, then so are we, darling.'  The only appropriate response is how appalling. What kind of cow leaves a marriage just because the helicopter has left the lawn? Indeed, any decent person should despise these women, right? Well, no, actually, wrong. It seems to me that these women are loyal to a fault, that is, loyal to the deal that was originally struck. When you think about it, there is a world of difference between being a trophy wife - waving hubby off on his private jet while you face another day of lonely, unfulfilled spending in Barneys - to being a real wife - having some sacked bitter bozo under your feet all day, reliving past glories, hogging the remote control and asking too many questions about your lipo-fund.  More to the point, before we all start working ourselves into a righteous lather over the behaviour of the trophy wives, these masters of the universe knew what they were getting into. After all, weren't they the ones who brokered the 'deal' in the first place - their cash and status for a trophy wife (someone to make their peers drool)?  So, no cash, no trophy wife. It's a simple enough psychosexual equation. Cold yes, but only as cold as the one that makes it clear to the trophy wife that she will be unceremoniously dumped, Trump-style, for a new hottie if she commits the crimes of becoming fat, old or Ivana (the patron saint of failed trophy wives). In short, in the land of the deal, the fleeing rat-wives have a point - what does love have to do with it? Indeed, while the new breed of credit-crunch bailer-wives might be ruthless, maybe they learned from their masters. Only last week, I was hard at work doing research (OK, sprawled on the sofa reading the Daily Mail) and came across the tale of Arpad Busson, the hedge-fund philanthropist and multi-zillionaire, who had a nine-year, two-children relationship with model Elle Macpherson, allegedly couldn't marry her, because he was a strict Catholic, and she was a divorcee and then went on to propose to twice-divorced Uma Thurman.  Just as I was thinking :'Nice guy - way to go, Uma', I came across another tale of Super-rich Lurrve Gone Sour. Christie Brinkley's Hamptons' paradise was shattered when her husband was discovered paying off a neighbour's teenage daughter to keep quiet about their affair. Just in case Christie hadn't been humiliated enough, the divorce judge commented that she might care to 'examine her taste in men'.  At which point, you think, enough already! Whatever happened to the great high-end romances, the ones that were examples to us all - Bogie and Bacall, Scott and Zelda, Bill and Monica? Which, for their sins, were about love, sex and madness. Anything but money.  So what are we seeing here - the revenge of the trophy spouse? Certainly it's a timely reminder to the rich of Manhattan that the first law of the trophy wife is that she, natch, atrophies at the first sign of trouble. For the rest of us, it's culturally interesting. In the aftermath of 9/11, another great period of international stress, it was noted, rather droningly, that every day brought a new life lesson. With this in mind, maybe we should take heed of the morality tales emerging from the credit-crunch crisis. Certainly, it seems to say something that the relationships of the rich seem to be the first ones to go. While the poor are sticking together, the rich are splitting like atoms. Has schadenfreude ever tasted so sweet? Noble rugby chaps behaving like plebby footballers? I say, that's not cricket Now, let me just get my facts straight. Footballers are the yobbish, greedy, sexually depraved disgrace of the British sporting world. Meanwhile, other team sports, such as rugby and cricket, are throwbacks to a nobler, less oikish era, when men were gentlemen, England was forever England, dignity meant all and ... excuse me, I feel slightly bilious, I'll be back after some Alka-Seltzer. How many times have I heard this kind of guff? Even fallen for it? However, it doesn't add up, especially not after a week when England rugby players Mike Brown and Topsy Ojo have been shown to have been coldly sexually opportunistic towards a teenage girl they met during a tour of New Zealand. Details are scarce, but it seems that the girl agreed to have sex with one of them and then another. (I believe the term is roasting, gentlemen.) Now Brown and Ojo have been found guilty of misconduct for 'staying out all night'. The RFU said their behaviour was 'inconsistent with the life of an elite professional rugby player in the modern era'. Well, that told them. It's a puzzle: why do people persist in thinking there is anything automatically noble about sport when logic dictates that it's about as automatically noble as bingo or any other form of popular entertainment? Once society starts grading team sports in terms of nobility, the class divisions soon become laughably obvious. It can't be a coincidence that there are predominantly middle-class cricketers and rugby players at the top and working-class footballers at the bottom.  Not that this is a great week to defend football. In the current climate, Frank Lampard should maybe have thought twice before moaning that his millions weren't enough. Then there is the increasingly surreal Cristiano Ronaldo-Real Madrid signing fracas - if he is Manchester United's slave, then I'm a promising centre forward.  However, aren't all sportsmen conditioned to be overpaid brats these days? What seems certain is that if the sport of football has problems, it is not the only one. While the full facts are yet to be revealed, it does sound like certain nice, middle-class rugby players may be as into roasting as any plebby, pissed, opportunistic bunch of footballers. What I want to know is - where is the similar uproar? · How exciting that Barack Obama will visit the UK. We've all become such Obama groupies, it would be disappointing not to see scenes as frenzied as the Osmonds arriving in the 70s. I may pop down to the airport and do a bit of screaming and swaying with a tasselled scarf. Obama is not this popular in the States, if you're getting civil rights legend Jesse Jackson caught on mike saying he wants 'to cut his nuts off' or, as one report primly had it, 'his twin objects of male anatomy'.  So, maybe when Barack comes over here, we should just keep him, like when Kathy Bates 'kept' James Caan in Misery. Our boy may need some gentle persuasion, like breaking his legs a bit. Never mind all that US presidency stuff - wouldn't he be better off here in the UK where he is obsessively loved?","Barbara Ellen: Ah, love.

"The expression, ""Oh, my poor feet!"" is said to have been turned into a popular catchphrase by the Great Exhibition of 1851 - millions of people sighing these words as they shuffled through Joseph Paxton's Crystal Palace and stood in slow-moving lines to squeeze a glimpse of the Kohinoor diamond or the latest refinements in the daguerreotype. Likewise, what I remember about the Festival of Britain, the anniversary celebration that followed a hundred years later, is the patience it required - the queue that needed to be endured before we could buy our specially minted five shilling coins; the slow trek through the Dome of Discovery to see the models of Captain Cook and the solar system; the futile visit to Roland Emett's whimsical miniature railway (""the Far Tottering and Oyster Creek Railway"") in Battersea Park, which for some reason was closed on the day we went. Above my six-year-old head, parental conversations went back and forth about the heat and the feet, the crowds and the wisdom of ice-cream. Higher even than that, visible wherever we went, stood the Skylon.  My question then was: what is it for? Was it a rocket? Would it take off? But it had no purpose other than just to be, a fact that I think mystified my parents as much as me. What I know now is that the Festival of Britain's designers held a competition for a ""vertical feature"" that was won by the architects, Hidalgo Moya and Philip Powell. They supplied a cigar-shaped structure that was 300ft high and rested on steel cables strung 50ft above the ground - the calculations of weight and tension were the clever work of the engineer Felix Samuely - so that at a distance, and especially when lit at night, it seemed to float in mid-air. The Skylon was a British generation's first glimpse of futurism, but there was no great fuss when it was broken up the next year and its aluminium (according to rumour) turned into ashtrays.  This week Londoners could see it again, when, as part of the London Festival of Architecture, a full-sized projection was beamed on to the side of the Shell Building on the South Bank. The architect Jack Pringle, a former president of the Riba, is leading a campaign to have Skylon rebuilt and the chances are he'll succeed. The cost isn't exorbitant - upwards of £1m - and the blankness of Skylon, its sheer lack of purpose as either a memorial or a machine, is no longer either mysterious or repellent in an age when cities compete for icons that will get them noticed. On the one (and darker) hand, what Skylon prefigured was the miserable lumps of twisted steel plonked down on roundabouts, there to masquerade as ""public architecture"". On the other, according to Pringle, it started the hi-tech movement: a style that, thanks to Rogers and Foster, made Britain famous as its leading exponent. The South Bank has no room for a rebuild, but Battersea power station is a distinct possibility.  Its re-creation may be part of a movement in urban thinking. I wouldn't want to exaggerate the likely effect, but nonetheless London has various campaigns that in some cases seek to rebuild the past (Skylon, the Euston Arch) and in others to uncover and beautify it. For example, Design for London, the agency that advises the mayor, wants to take many of the Thames's tributaries (usually referred to as London's ""lost"" or ""secret"" rivers) out of their culverts and transform them into ornamental waterways to make the city cooler in summer and a haven for walkers and plants in all seasons. The scheme has begun in the suburbs. The Wandle, where Nelson caught trout, has been cleaned and restocked with fish on its course north to Wandsworth; a section of the Quaggy has been uncovered in southeast London; there are plans for the Ravensbourne in Lewisham and the Brent in Wembley. The real challenge comes with inner London: the Westbourne, whose flow created the Serpentine; the Fleet, where in the 18th century a barge could sail up from the Thames to Smithfield; the Tyburn, used to form the lakes in Regent's Park on it way down from Hampstead to Westminster. All three were buried along their entire course but idealists among planners talk of uncovering small sections of them to improve the capital's quality of life.  The ""secret river"" is a powerful idea that has attracted Hindu and Greek myths, psycho-geographers, historians and idle fancies of all kinds. Among London's lost rivers, the Tyburn is especially secretive. The best book on the subject (The Lost Rivers of London by NJ Barton) records that its course can be followed through Marylebone by the winding character of Marylebone Lane and at Green Park by the dip in Piccadilly. ""From here onwards,"" Barton writes gravely, ""all is in doubt."" Did it divide into two or three and form Thorney Island, on which Westminster Abbey is built? Did it peter out in marshland? Did it go straight towards Vauxhall?  The question mildly obsesses a property developer, James Bowdidge, whose plans to bring the Tyburn back to the surface were published in London's Evening Standard this week. Of course, they were a joke: apart from any other difficulty, many buildings in Mayfair would need to be demolished. But the complexity and thoroughness of the joke are specialisms peculiar to England, the same kind of artful whimsy that led the cartoonist Emett to build his Heath Robinson contraptions for Far Tottering and Oyster Creek Railway; and so a visit to Bowdidge's office was a kind of compensation for the trains that refused to run on the day we went to Battersea Park in 1951.  Bowdidge, a cheerful man, showed off futuristic maps and plans, with the banks of the recovered Tyburn coloured green and fishing huts marked in red. He founded the Tyburn Angling Society a few years ago, inspired by listening to the sound of rushing water underneath a manhole outside his flat near Bond Street. The society claims a royal charter of 959, has a Latin motto, traditions, and meetings at the Fly Fishers' Club. John Buchan might easily have invented it as a pastime for a group of Edwardian boy-men with too much time and money on their hands (""Women members are allowed but must always be addressed in the masculine""). There are no records of any fish ever being caught in the Tyburn, but Bowdidge has a picture of himself standing in waders with a rod directed at a drain outside Claridges and later sent me a photograph of a pinkish fillet labelled with the name of a supermarket as ""Tyburn Salmon"".  Faux eccentricity can be tiresome. As Bowdidge said in a puzzled way: ""Some people just don't get it."" Still, his enthusiastic direction led me to several gratings where I might see or hear what he claimed as the Tyburn. Outside Vidal Sassoon's shop, I bent down but heard nothing. Further on, near the Guinea Grill, I heard water. At my third manhole, just behind Berkeley Square, I had a plain view of a swift stream.  The undeniable fact, however, is that I was looking into a sewer, a sewer owned by Thames Water and more remotely by banks and pension funds in Australia and Canada. The Tyburn and the Fleet have been sewers for hundreds of years as part of a combined system, far too expensive to separate, that carries rainwater and human waste. Moreover, they rarely follow the course of the original river: engineers would build sewers hundreds of yards away and divert the flow at the top end, to fill in the old bed and cover it in houses or, in the case of the Fleet, a railway.  London may get its Skylon back, even its Euston Arch. The hidden rivers of its inner city will remain, as they should, a wonderful speculation and a fantasy.","Ian Jack: Is it a secret river, an ornamental waterway, or a sewer?",2008-07-11T23:01:00Z,Ian Jack,uk
"Start with the victory bit. The former shadow home secretary tripled his majority in Haltemprice and Howden and did so on a convincing turnout – or at least one that did not plumb the single-digit depths which some were predicting. As he put it this morning, more than 15,000 people turned out to vote for him on ""a rainy day in Yorkshire"" and, even with no Labour or Lib Dem opposition, that counts for something. The campaign, as well as the result, brought some credit to Davis. He won high-profile support, from the likes of Bob Geldof and Martin Bell, and a commentariat that had initially written him off as either vain or deranged came around to give him grudging respect. On the substance, Davis has won admiration for taking a stance in defence of civil liberties that are indeed under assault. Despite his insistence this morning that he will not be a ""single issue campaigner"", libertarians in Britain will now look to him as one of their strongest advocates. But here's why the victory was Pyrrhic. Davis hoped this by-election campaign would electrify British politics and it didn't. We have not spent the last month debating 42 days, as he intended us to do. Instead, after the initial flurry, the Davis crusade gained little attention. More importantly, it is now clear that Davis's ability to make a difference on this question is reduced. A month ago he was in the shadow cabinet, on course to help formulate the policy of what seems set to be Britain's next government and to serve as its home secretary. David Cameron's comments this morning that he already has a strong shadow cabinet and that Davis might make ""a contribution in the future"" suggests the Yorkshire rebel is not coming back any time soon. This was always the curious riddle at the heart of Davis's quixotic gesture. Why resign on an issue of principle if that entails becoming less rather than more able to have an effect on that very issue? The result is that David Davis emerges today with his standing among libertarians enhanced – but his influence on the future of British liberty sharply reduced.","Jonathan Freedland: So Davis won, but what did he really achieve?",2008-07-11T11:00:00Z,Jonathan Freedland,politics
"So the Footsie has tumbled again. Forgive me for asking, but where are the economists? As the nation approaches recession, an entire profession seems to have vanished over the horizon, like conmen stuffed with cash, and thousands left destitute behind. They said recessions were over. They told politicians to leave things to them and all would be fine. Yet they failed to spot the sub-prime housing crash, and now look at the mess. When I studied economics we were told we would be masters of the universe. Ours was not a dismal but a noble science. It had harnessed the verities of maths to those of human behaviour and would go on to conquer politics. Rampant recession would go the way of hyperinflation. Like leprosy and cholera, they were epidemics that modern medicine had rid from our shores. It did not matter if the economists were welfare Keynesians such as Myrdal, Robinson and Galbraith or free-marketeers such as Marshall, Friedman and the Institute of Economic Affairs. All were ""social scientists"". They claimed to have cracked the DNA of economic exchange, to have turned the base metal of money into political gold. We believed them. We believed the Keynesians until we slumped into stagflation. We believed light-regulation capitalists such as Margaret Thatcher and Gordon Brown, that they could convert boom-bust into an upward sloping plane of glory. We believed the Bank of England when it said that, in its hands, inflation was dead and prosperity eternal. Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive - and an economist. If Britain were now in the grip of bubonic plague, there would be all hell to pay from some profession or other. An ""influential"" Commons committee would be summoning the chief medical officer and subjecting him to the third degree. Why no national rat strategy? Why no crash inoculation? Why so many planning delays on plague pits? The espionage pundits were likewise castigated for wrongly leading the nation to war against Iraq, for giving dud professional assessments on fallacious intelligence. The architectural profession has taken the rap (very occasionally) for the grotesque failures of public housing in the 1970s. Climate scientists may yet be damned for the costly lunacy of new energy sources, such as wind turbines and biofuels. Yet economics is a Teflon profession. A quarter of a century ago 364 practitioners wrote a letter denouncing the policies of the then Thatcher government as having ""no basis in economic theory"". They were wrong in fact and wrong in judgment. Thatcher's policies laid the groundwork for a strategic shift in the underpinning of British prosperity. There was no inquiry, no hearing, no peep of retraction or remorse. Since then economists have flooded into government; there were roughly a thousand at the last count. What do they all do? Despite reports of demoralisation in the Treasury, that department remains the home base for public sector management through financial aggregates. During the Blair/Brown era it has held government in thrall. Economic managers have always claimed credit for the success of Brown's Treasury regime. They have espoused quantifiable outputs, targets and delivery indicators. They invented the celebrity consultant and the maxim that only what measures matters. Above all, the economics profession (and its house journal, the Economist) was ecstatic when Brown delegated monetary control to the Bank of England. This was supposed to isolate the economy from political pressure, subcontracting the regulation of interest rates and markets.  Today we are older and wiser. Controlling the agencies of credit has proved beyond the finest professional minds in the game. Where now are the effortless pundits of the Treasury and the Bank? Where now the gilded ones of Moody's and Standard & Poor's, credit raters to the mightiest in the land? They should have stuck to goose entrails. Alan Greenspan, former chief of the US Federal Reserve Board and a Brown adviser, is unrepentant. He recently declared that ""anticipating the next financial malfunction ... has not proved feasible"". There is nothing so unseeing as a wronged economist. The Bank of England's apologias over Northern Rock have been protests that regulation is a mess and government indecisive. When muck hits fan, economists always blame politicians. They would have some justice if they did not take credit when things go right. I was always uncomfortable at the overselling of economics as a science, when it is rather a branch of psychology, a study of the peculiarities of human nature. Its spurious objectivity, manifest in its ridiculous love affair with maths, induced a ""Jupiter complex"", a conviction that scientific certainty, applied with enough rigour to any problem, triumphs over all. Economic management is and always will be about politics, about the clash of needs and demands resolved through the constitutional process. The delegation of interest rates to the Bank of England worked when it ran in parallel with politics, but not any more. Now that reflation seems urgent for recovery, the system is biased against common sense, yet no politician dare tell the Bank to cut rates and risk inflation. The newest craze is ""nudge"" economics, from the Americans, Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein. They put the subject firmly among the behavioural sciences - if not the arts. Human actions are too mysterious and unpredictable to be liable to quantification and modelling. They are responsive to what the academic Paul Ormerod called ""butterfly economics"". Nudge steers, but does not order or plan. This requires knowledge of the working of markets, incentives, expectations and panics. But converting micro-economics into macro has always been a dangerous game. Much has been made of the success of Spain's dirigiste banking regulators in putting security before runaway profit. But this was a triumph of politics over economics. Greenspan may laconically remark that ""we can never have a perfect model of risk"", but we can have alertness to risk and we can have caution. Economics has long traded on being a science when it is not. In this it is like war. For a third of a century since the 1976 IMF crisis it has enjoyed great influence over British policy. Now it has met its Waterloo and a little humility would be in order. Once again economics must be rescued by that true master of all things, politics. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com","Simon Jenkins: When the going gets tough, economists go very quiet",2008-07-08T23:01:00Z,Simon Jenkins,politics
"Publicising Hancock, this year's Independence Day blockbuster, the American actor Will Smith, who plays the superhero, has claimed that his character differs in one revolutionary respect from all rival superheroes. 'We put the underwear on the inside of the pants,' he says. 'We broke genre.' Wrong, and now doubly so. Fans of Prince Harry will recall that underwear was, in fact, the only part of his wardrobe not shown earlier this year, when the royal gunman was filmed beating off waves of battle-hardened Taliban fighters. His brother William was also conventionally dressed last week when, as one of many admiring headlines revealed, his ship pulled off a '£40m cocaine bust during his first week at sea'. It had been anticipated that it would take the prince at least two weeks to subjugate the strutting pirates of the Caribbean. But Commander Mark Newland was privileged to be aboard when the prince's men were photographed seizing sackfuls of loot from humbled buccaneers. Confirming that the prince had not even been seasick, despite a heavy swell, he stressed William's 'maturity and experience' during an operation which also called for riding in a helicopter and a host of other skills that the prince was fortunate enough to refresh, not long ago, on a training expedition to the Isle of Wight. 'He is someone who contributes at every level,' said Commander Newland. 'He is a very professional military officer, and very astute.' And if that does - as it should - send a shiver down the spines of any drug pirates still minded to ply their evil trade, then it must also banish any remaining doubts about the cost and location of William's recent helicopter training, no matter whether it was to a stag party, a paddock next to his girlfriend's parents' house, or the narrow pavement outside the Hungerford Wine Rack where he had been sent to pick up a bottle of Chardonnay. 'The daring mission was a spectacular start to the prince's stint on the Iron Duke,' declared one tabloid report. 'With this kind of success in his first few days, who knows what he will have achieved by the time he leaves HMS Iron Duke in August?' Who knows? But so long as it keeps his uniformed image before us, it will not have been time wasted. Even allowing for the £50,000 helicopter setback (a lapse that is understood to have been entirely the fault of other people), followed by some ill-advised smirking at a Garter ceremony, William can clearly rely on a level of goodwill that far exceeds anything his father enjoyed at the same age. By the time of his Welsh investiture in 1969, Charles was already targeted by nationalists who hoped to blow him up; by 1972, he was well within the sights of the late MP for West Fife, Willie Hamilton, who proposed, in one Commons debate, that the government nationalise Charles's paymasters - the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall, and all the other crown estates. Hamilton said it was 'indefensible' that a miner could work for a lifetime without earning 'as much as we pay that young twerp in a year'. It made no difference to Mr Hamilton, or to the 100 or so MPs who voted with him, that Prince Charles had recently engaged in exactly the sort of work experience which is now supplying the producers of William and Harry with such matchless propaganda. Nowadays, our twerps are hymned by a grateful Des Browne. In 1972 Mr Hamilton said: 'He's been in the air force, he's been in the navy. He ought to spend the next three months in the coal mines.' If Bagehot was the first to appreciate the indulgent recognition that could be stirred by representations of the royal family, so simple and loving 'it brings down the pride of sovereignty to the level of petty life', Hamilton seems to have pioneered their complementary deployment as icons of lushery and greed, whose obvious differences were shorthand for everything that should move us to class loathing. Of course this was before we had David Cameron. 'He attacks royalty because he considers it the loftiest symbol of wealth and privilege in a society marked by gross disparities,' a Guardian profile of Hamilton explained in 1971. 'It incenses him that £80,000 should be paid refurbishing the home of a princess in a city where thousands have no home at all ...' The princess in question was Margaret, described by Hamilton as a 'floozie' and 'kept woman', and whose heroic pointlessness is only now becoming fully understood. In her fascinating new biography of Snowdon, Anne de Courcy relates how the princess became so bored with doing nothing, that she was reduced to washing her coral collection; a more wholesome source of solace, you might think, than the Queen Mother's recourse, after breakfast, to Dubonnet and gin, in the solution of one part to eight. A touching note to a servant, shown last week for the first time, indicates the recommended dosage: 'I think that I will take two small bottles of Dubonnet and gin with me this morning, in case it is needed ...' Hamilton, at the time, could only go by appearances, which were bad enough. Margaret got her roof, while Charles remained stubbornly above ground; preferring to comply with his uncle Battenberg's proposal that he try out as many amenable women as possible, before he was forced to pick out an unused one. How times have changed. Not only does Prince William now appear content to sleep with the same young woman, year after monogamous year; a parallel atrophy of the British republican movement ensures that, although the royals' idleness and privilege proceed absolutely as before, their subjects have for some reason lost interest in crushing, or even reducing the prodigious number of these dependants. 'We are gradualists,' the Guardian declared, when it launched the most recent, prominent, campaign for a republic in 2000, 'we accept that it will not happen tomorrow.' But it hasn't happened in eight years. Betty Boothroyd is 78. Can you even remember the last time someone asked how you'd like a President like George Bush? What would rouse republicans from their long sleep? Not, as we have seen, the princes posing as warriors, when real ones are dying every week. Nor Charles and Camilla taking a cruise to save on aeroplanes; nor Kate Middleton (even without a coral collection to wash) going for full-time parasitism. The Queen, it turned out, was entirely right to think that the eve of a vicious recession was the perfect moment to angle for £32m for repairs. Some barely audible grumbling about her nerve was quickly drowned by the roar of protest about swinish MPs, with their £61,000, if you please, and outrageous John Lewis allowances. In fact, with Labour politicians mopping up most of the hatred, and the Tories volunteering for toff duty, the royal family is settling into what promises to be, for those with the brains to keep quiet, a golden era. Which still, thankfully, leaves us with the twerp.",Catherine Bennett: Where are our anti-royalists when you need them the most?,2008-07-05T23:01:00Z,Catherine Bennett,uk
"Whatever happened to Keith Vaz, you are unlikely to have asked yourself since the member for Leicester East last made the headlines. Mr Vaz is the political equivalent of one of those minor British character actors, whose occasional appearance on the TV screen my mother tends to greet with the rhetorical question, ""Goodness, is he still going?"" Most likely, you had forgotten all about Keith, perhaps working on the misplaced assumption that, even in our faulty political system, palpably untalented greasers do not end up getting rewarded forever. Yet it seems that not only has the chap once nicknamed Vazeline continued to parlay a lack of discernible talent into positions of significant influence - he was last year given the chairmanship of the home affairs select committee - but that misfortune continues to dog him at every turn.  This week he cropped up again, having been revealed as the recipient of a note from fellow where-are-they-now-files resident Geoff Hoon. According to reports, Geoff is now Labour's chief whip, and he seems to have been painfully grateful for Keith's U-turn on the 42-day vote, which you will recall the government won by a majority of nine. ""Dear Keith,"" reads this missive, which the government and Vaz both insist does not refer to any promises offered in return for support. ""Thank you for all your help during the period leading up to Wednesday's vote. I wanted you to know how much I appreciated all your help. I trust it will be appropriately rewarded! With thanks and best wishes, Geoff.""  Yes, Keith is very much still going. Whether he is going all the way to the Lords only time will show, but he does have a remarkable knack for surfacing at moments of high drama in the great New Labour story. If Gordon Brown was Macavity - never there when the crime's discovered - then Vaz is Zelig. Were we being very charitable, we might commute his epithet to New Labour's Forrest Gump, but he remains a chap who has popped up on all manner of notable occasions.  Where to begin? In medias res, perhaps, with Elizabeth Filkin, the standards commissioner effectively removed from her job by a Labour-inspired whispering campaign. Yet even by the standards of New Labour obstruction, Mr Vaz's attempts to hinder her investigations into undeclared donations and his finances were unprecedented. He even hired solicitors, who swiftly informed Ms Filkin he would not be answering any more questions. ""We only ask that witnesses tell the truth,"" noted one scathing ruling of the committee. ""Solicitors are not required for that purpose.""  It was not the only time Mr Vaz would be accused of holding things back. In 2001, the parliamentary ombudsman found that he had withheld information from MPs about advice he'd given on human rights and the Ilisu dam project in Turkey. The international development committee found his explanations ""vague, unconvincing and on occasion desperate"". That verdict went in the trophy cabinet alongside the foreign affairs committee's opinion that he'd failed to grasp British policy in the Balkans. What range he has; but where would he pop up next? I suppose a notable absence was the Hutton inquiry, but given that he played such a key role at that earlier whitewash, the Hammond inquiry, Mr Vaz can be forgiven for not giving us his hapless innocent a second time. The Hammond inquiry, you'll recall - and aren't these reminders of New Labour scandals heartsinking? - cleared Mr Vaz in the Hinduja cash-for-passports affair, ruling that his ""vigorous"" representations for the billionaire brothers were not an improper form of fast-tracking.  At this point Ms Filkin renewed her interest in Mr Vaz's affairs, but it was not long before he was signed off from work after being struck down by ill health. As he explained to a radio interviewer: ""We will do what we need to do to get over the illness that has afflicted us."" We were very successful on this front - Lazarusian, even - although the wretched standards and privileges lot ended up suspending us from parliament for a month for our ""serious breaches"" of the MPs' code of conduct, and for holding the Commons in contempt.  Alas, space contraints do not permit a full rundown of Mr Vaz's Zelig-like inconsistencies, though a personal favourite finds the subsequently robotically loyal MP, a Catholic, leading Muslims in his constituency on a protest against Salman Rushdie in 1989, and denouncing Labour as ""a godless party"". He's come a long way - often in reverse - so it's somehow reassuring to find him surfacing again in the wildly unedifying 42-day drama. Until the note surfaced, all one had felt of his presence in this totemic New Labour row was his initial opposition to the idea, followed by the inevitable vote in the other direction. Peripheral, and yet always there: Vaz is the sort of character dramatists love to deploy to tell the bigger story of an age. If he does end up in the House of Lords - and you wouldn't bet against it - he should reflect this questionable gift in his baronial title. Lord Vaz of The-Wrong-Place-at-the-Wrong-Time has a nice ring to it, and we look forward to his appearances in the many, many years to come.Marina.hyde@theguardian.com",Marina Hyde: The man who became the Zelig of New Labour,2008-07-04T23:01:00Z,Marina Hyde,politics
"Call it the Potomac shuffle, the traditional election-year dance in which a candidate who has earlier moved left or right to win over the party faithful in a primary campaign promptly slides back to the centre to appeal to the rest of the country. Barack Obama, quite a mover on the dancefloor, has spent the month since he beat Hillary Clinton to the Democratic nomination giving a demonstration of this time-honoured piece of Washington choreography - and at an unusually high tempo, too.  Just yesterday he announced, in a speech on religion aimed at wooing evangelicals - who Democrats believe are no longer a guaranteed bloc for the Republicans - that he would continue George Bush's support for ""faith-based initiatives"", channelling public money to religious groups to perform social services, whether drug rehab or care for the poor. (Side note: watch for David Cameron, who also favours this approach, to claim he is Obama's spiritual brother.)  A day earlier Obama had delivered an equally long address on the virtues of patriotism. On his lapel was the flag pin he has worn since mid-May, the same pin he once disdained as an unnecessary, shallow display of love of country. More substantively, Obama has tacked towards the centre on a string of issues where a matter of months ago he was to be found much further left.  He once opposed legislation needed for Bush's much-reviled programme of domestic surveillance; now he supports a new law that would grant immunity to phone companies that help the government eavesdrop on US citizens. He was an advocate of gun control, but only hemmed and hawed when the supreme court struck down the District of Columbia's ban on hand guns last week. He now says he will consider joining his Republican opponent John McCain in calling for a cut in the corporate tax rate. Suffice to say, these were not positions Obama took when he was trying to win Democratic votes in New Hampshire or Iowa.  What will most strike - and disappoint - those outside the United States, those who have been all but panting in their excitement at the prospect of an Obama presidency as a break from the Bush era, is the Democrat's march rightward on foreign policy. His signature stance, which propelled him from obscurity into challenging the mighty Clinton, was his opposition to the Iraq war and his promise to bring the troops home. Now, though, the talk is not of immediate withdrawal but of pulling out one or two ""combat"" brigades a month, a pledge so vague it leaves acres of wriggle room. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that the Iraqi foreign minister, Hoshyar Zebari, had been concerned that Obama would withdraw US forces too hastily, but came away from a long phone call with the candidate ""reassured"" that a President Obama would not do anything too ""drastic"". Last autumn Obama skilfully contrasted himself with Clinton by promising to replace Bush's bellicosity with a willingness to talk even to America's sworn enemies, the president of Iran among them. But in a major foreign policy speech last month, he diluted that promise of talks and said he would do ""everything in my power"" to stop Iran getting a nuclear bomb - pointedly repeating the word ""everything"" in case Tehran had not got the message.  Obama's most leftwing supporters have dutifully played the role expected of them, howling betrayal, with the activists of MoveOn leading the lamentation. But even centrist Democrats, who understand the politics of the Potomac shuffle only too well, are troubled. ""He's overdoing it,"" says a longtime party strategist (who, admittedly, did not back Obama in the primaries). ""He's reversing too many positions too quickly."" This view is shared by those who reckon Obama is a special case. Of course, they say, presidential candidates always have to shift towards the centre after a primary campaign; indeed, as Michael Tomasky argued in these pages on Monday, it is a sign of McCain's weakness that he has not been able to do so nearly as extensively as his opponent. But Obama is not just any candidate.  ""You can't do it if you've run as Gandhi,"" says Leon Wieseltier, who observes Washington from his perch at the magazine New Republic. He contrasts Obama with the Bill Clinton of 1992, who also moved rightward once he had bagged the nomination. Both men offered to transcend the old categories of left and right, but Clinton did so by promising to be ideologically flexible. Obama's implicit promise is that he is above left and right, not because he is pragmatic so much as because he is morally good. In this context, says Wieseltier, U-turns are much less tolerable: ""They compromise his radiance."" There are other contrasts. Bill Clinton could finesse shifts by wrapping them in the language of policy detail; Obama is the very opposite of a policy wonk. He operates at 30,000 feet, somewhere in the rhetorical stratosphere. While the Clinton of 1992 talked obsessively about the economy, ensuring hard-pressed voters knew he felt their pain, Obama has not yet persuaded Americans that he has the answer to current woes. One Democratic strategist thinks Obama should be talking about rising gas and food prices every single day, not making grand speeches about faith or patriotism. Indeed, Obama's sheer eloquence, combined with the string of recent policy flip-flops, points to another worry many Democrats are beginning to voice about their nominee: that there might be a hollowness to him, an absence where there should be a clear core of belief (not that Bill Clinton had that either). When Ronald Reagan ran in 1980, it was clear that he relied on two ideological pillars: free-market economics and a fierce anti-communism. Obama-sceptics ask what the equivalents would be for the senator from Illinois. The harshest say his campaign has no theme beyond his own life story. They note that in his three years in the Senate, he found no time to author legislation - though he did manage to write a second volume of autobiography.  Yet none of these grumblers and doomsayers will go so far as to predict that Obama will lose in November. He remains ahead in national polls, while some analysts say a reshaping of the electoral map is possible: if black turnout rises, several southern states could be Obama's, while wins out west, in New Mexico, Colorado and Nevada could, by themselves, be enough to give the Democrats the White House. Obama fervour remains high, especially among the young. This weekend word emerged of a new fad on college campuses, as students, both male and female, adopt Obama's middle name of Hussein - the target for much xenophobic whispering - as their own. Think ""I am Spartacus"". In this light, Obama's U-turns look different. They suggest that he is determined not to be just another principled loser - and the Democrats have had plenty of those. The clearest illustration came in Obama's most blatant reverse. He had promised to stay within the system of taxpayer-funded campaign finance, which would have obliged him to stick to an $85m spending limit. Once it became clear he could raise, and spend, many times that amount, he broke his pledge. Sure, it was unprincipled. But it suggested a man bent on winning and ruthless enough to make sure he does. That's the standard operating procedure for Republicans. For Democrats it takes some getting used to.  freedland@theguardian.com",Jonathan Freedland: Obama's shuffle to the right suggests this man is ruthless enough to win,2008-07-01T23:01:00Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"One of the great regrets, for a woman with a growing interest in soft paternalism, is that she will never be able to admire the little black flies etched into the urinals in the men's lavatories at Schiphol airport. It was thanks to these flies, according to Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein, the authors of Nudge, an engaging new book about manipulating people's behaviour, that the airport was able to 'reduce spillage by 80 per cent'. Even without being asked to, or told to, most men chose to aim at the fly, rather than, as before, piss all over the floor. 'It worked wonders.'  The academics, Thaler and Sunstein, extol this particular prompt, or, to advertise their brand, 'nudge', as a classic example of successful 'libertarian paternalism': libertarian because the men remain free, if they choose, to trash their lavatories; paternalist, because the authorities are encouraging the men to behave in a way that will make life nicer, and healthier, for all of them. Why, if the flies work, should this well-meant, do-the-right thing principle not be used to improve behaviour outside Amsterdam? Even outside the men's lavatories? What if you could arrange things, invisibly, so that people would behave equally responsibly when it came to paying taxes and saving money, recycling rubbish and picking up litter?  Although Nudge may be the first book to bring the latest in paternalist thinking before a wider public, something for which we, as potential nudge-beneficiaries, or victims, should probably be grateful, the idea that lessons from psychology faculties could be used by the state to improve an individual's behaviour, seems to have been around for a while. Whether qualified by 'asymmetrical' or 'soft', 'anti-anti' or Nudge's 'libertarian', the paternalistic premise appears to be pretty much the same: play on the vagaries of human nature - such as conformity, idleness, unrealistic optimism - to save people from themselves. You can see why this idea, with its unbossy, yet gloriously manipulative promise might make a deep impression on David Cameron. One of the difficulties for a Tory, even a liberal one such as him, is the delivery of a better world without any of the clunking legislation and choice-denying interference which, he argues, dooms all Brown's 'top-down state solutions' for changing people's ways. How can Cameron make people go green, for instance, without any Brown-style, spy-in-the-yogurt-pot varieties of compulsion? His latest wheeze, borrowed from shrinks and behavioural economists, he has called 'going with the grain of human nature'. In the same speech, billed by political experts as 'important', he continued: 'With the right prompting - or what Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler in their latest book have called a ""nudge"" - we'll change our behaviour to fit in with what we see around us.'  His mentors describe this adherence to social norms less politely, as 'following the herd'. This well-documented quirk, so evident in Nazi Germany, and still encouraged by British Gas and others whose only hope of new business lies in the fog of human irrationality, might also be exploited, Cameron hazarded, to make people save energy. Without oppressive green laws! He had heard about Nudge's account of an experiment in California, where information about average energy consumption prompted high users in the same neighbourhood to decrease their energy use. Unfortunately, the same information prompted low users to increase theirs: 'If you want to nudge people into socially desirable behaviour,' stress Sunstein and Thaler, 'do not, by any means, let them know that their current actions are better than the social norm.'  Clearly, 'going with the grain of human nature', or to put it another way, messing with irrationality, is not quite as innocent or straightforward as the little word 'nudge' makes it sound. Indeed, you wonder if the temperamental Cameron may not have allowed himself to enter what is known, I understand, as an unpredictable 'hot state' in investing so much in this potentially creepy, and certainly limited line in behaviour modification. Leave aside any worries about the nudging ambitions of more unscrupulous politicians, particularly at election time, and there must still be questions about the broader application of the fly in the urinal. Nudging is most effective, the authors show, in enhancing people's decisions about things such as investments, health insurance and pensions, 'decisions that are difficult, complex, and infrequent, and when they have poor feedback and few opportunities for learning'. Which only leaves, as a nudge-resistant zone, all the decisions people face that are simple, frequent, and seemingly obvious in their consequences. Such as how much to drink, whether or not to bunk off school or to eat the third packet of crisps (obese people sometimes being curiously immune to the power of social norms). Not to mention the social problems Cameron identified in his speech 'rising crime, family breakdown, falling social mobility'. Don't they require something more than a nudge?  Conveniently, Labour's answer to much of the above can also be summarised in one word: bribe. Last week's proposal to give parents £200 in exchange for looking after their children is only the latest in a series of cash offers, genuine or just proposed, aimed at securing behaviour that would once have passed for normal. Since 2000 Labour has suggested bribing, or actually offered people cash (or vouchers, or electronic goods), to, among other things, go to school, lose weight, stop smoking, travel by bicycle, read to their children, achieve good grades, eat healthily, study maths, return to work, behave well, save money and recycle. One need hardly add that its plans to avoid urinal 'spillage' will involve a lot more than engraved flies. Policymakers are already debating whether men would respond better to £1 a time or a scheme that gives you an Xbox360 for every spillage-free month.  Yet, for all this cash bonanza, there appears to be neither scholarly nor anecdotal evidence of these bribes leading to any sustained behavioural improvement (except for saving, because the child trust funds cannot be raided until their beneficiaries are 18 years old). The 'money to learn' education maintenance allowance, for keeping unwilling students off the unemployment figures, has been criticised, on the contrary, for having actively exacerbated attitudes towards both education and teachers, as well as instilling resentment in children who also wish to learn, but are not compensated for the loss of their ignorance.  What would a Libertarian Paternalist do? Find the social norm then harness it, I suppose: 'Go with the grain of human nature.' There is not long to wait before we discover whether it feels more patronising when a top-down government offers bribes in exchange for decent behaviour or when it instructs us, à la Cameron, that this adjustment is better achieved by peer pressure: 'One of the most important influences on people's behaviour,' he says, 'is what other people do.' At least he has the academics on his side. 'In Jonestown,' the authors of Nudge confirm, 'that influence was so strong that an entire population committed suicide.' Let us hope it does not come to that.",Catherine Bennett: Since when did politics become the equivalent of potty training?,2008-06-28T23:01:00Z,Catherine Bennett,politics
"Snowdon: The Biography by Anne De Courcy 456pp, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, £20 What has worked for Lord Snowdon all his life almost works in this hagiography. In a little world populated by England's most ghastly and dim, he again appears to enormous advantage; abrim with style (of a sort), charm (if you like that kind of thing) and energy (mainly for sex). It is worth remembering, of course, that in this context, the same would apply to the average tomcat. When, to his enormous satisfaction, the priapic photographer (then called Antony Armstrong-Jones) made it into the royal family, it was easy for this spoiled little pixie, with his extra-tight drainpipes and mesmerising bouffant, to be mistaken for a much-needed corrective to the snobbery, stupidity, and stolid sybaritism of the nation's top inbreds. Simply by being a society photographer, as opposed to a titled nothing, Snowdon was able to portray himself as an arty free spirit, almost an intellectual, under whose tonic tutelage, it was imagined, the Windsor troupe might evolve into a more acceptable, near-human subspecies. The success of this experiment can be quickly judged simply by looking at recent pictures of Prince Harry and his girlfriend, Chelsy Davy. One of the most interesting facts in Anne De Courcy's book is that Snowdon never reads. Another is that the most iconoclastic thing he ever did, as a royal, was to wear polo necks instead of ties; a level of democratic endeavour that proved eminently acceptable to his in-laws, who soon discovered that they preferred the dashing, yet reliably subservient, Tony to foul-tempered Princess Margaret. It helped that in all the key matters relating to status, the exploitation of servants, and unembarrassed grovelling, arty Armstrong-Jones was everything they might have hoped from the son of Lady Anne Rosse, or ""Tugboat Annie"" - so called ""because she goes from peer to peer"". Tugboat Jr quite eclipsed her, as he pranced between Queen and Queen Mother, enchanting both ladies to the point that, even after the divorce from Margaret, whom he treated abominably, they pined for his company at Balmoral. But, as De Courcy stresses, the decades of marital feuding and hate notes (""you look like a Jewish manicurist"") had started as a genuine romance. Meaning that Snowdon, who liked to keep several women on the go, may have confined himself to no more than one simultaneous affair, or at most, two, while he was courting the unsuspecting Margaret. Let us hope this provides some consolation to the British servicemen whose pay was docked by sixpence apiece in 1960 in order to provide the pair with a wedding present: ""a small marble-topped commode"", De Courcy reports. The exact nature of the qualities that captivated Princess Margaret, her family, Snowdon's legions of ill-treated lovers and, most recently, the author of this dazzled tribute, remains, even after 400 pages, obscure. Loyal De Courcy passes on reports of an extremely large penis, but that can hardly account for Snowdon's effect on Prince Philip. Or, later, on Christopher Frayling, rector of the Royal College of Art, who said Snowdon was ""the best provost we ever had"". Was it wit? None is recorded here. Young Snowdon's speciality was nasty practical jokes, such as putting dead fish in girls' beds. It was the grown-up Snowdon's, too: ""they would sortie out to the houses of neighbours they knew to be out or away"", De Courcy hilariously reports, of the earl and his chums, ""and rearrange all the furniture"". Looks, then? As irresistible as Snowdon may have been in the 50s and 60s, and even the 70s and 80s, it hardly accounts for the posh old shagger's continuing appeal, not only to the author of this homage, but, incredibly, to an attractive young journalist, Melanie Cable-Alexander (by whom he fathered a child), and, more recently, to Marjorie Wallace, the mental health campaigner who may now be remembered, above all, for her ungovernable passion for a past-it prankster. What do they talk about, over lunch at the Caprice? Much as one would like to imagine the lovebirds exchanging insights on photography, ornithological matters or disabled access, there is little evidence, from the taped conversations that became this book, that the activities which have given substance to his reputation actually interest the earl anything like as much as gossip, sexual intercourse and money. Even quite small amounts of money. There is mention, at one point, of ""postage"". A section about Snowdon's child by Cable-Alexander (one of two children whose paternity he at first questioned) specifies the fearful sums demanded by the little chap's prep school, ""from £2,375 a term"". And that comes on top, Snowdon emphasises, presumably in a bid for sympathy, of ""gas, electricity and telephone services, bills from Berry Bros, council tax of £1,377 ... "" Although De Courcy tries valiantly to generate admiration for various artistic and charitable triumphs, for Snowdon's photographs of ""slum children"", and his campaigns on behalf of disabled people, her efforts are continually nullified; not by her obvious partiality, but by yet more evidence of Snowdon's awfulness, as volunteered to her, exclusively, by himself. There are reasons, De Courcy shows, why Snowdon should have emerged so deceitful, manipulative and cruel; so mean, boastful and silly. His father sounds silly too. His mother, Tugboat, once she'd divorced and remarried, more or less ignored him until he bagged Margaret. He had polio as a child, leaving him with a dodgy leg. Then again, you'd think that half a century of adulation, plus a family, experience and a bit of maturity would eventually even things out. On the contrary. It is only, one suspects, because he is using a wheelchair that Snowdon does not, even now, creep out of a night to plant dead fish or rearrange people's furniture.",Review: Snowdon by Anne De Courcy,2008-06-27T23:03:00Z,Catherine Bennett,review
"Curious things are going on in the Middle East. On the one hand, Israel seems to be taking some early, tentative steps towards peace with its nearest enemies. It has just agreed a six-month ceasefire with Hamas in Gaza; it is deep into indirect peace talks with Syria, aimed at a comprehensive treaty; and earlier this month came word that Israel is keen to have direct negotiations with Lebanon. Yet all these welcome murmurings of peace are fighting to be heard above a growing drumbeat for war - against the country Israel fears more than any of its immediate neighbours: Iran. Last week it emerged that no fewer than a hundred Israeli fighter planes had taken part in an exercise in the Mediterranean that looked uncannily like a practice run for an attack on Iran. Earlier the former defence minister Shaul Mofaz, who still sits in Israel's security cabinet, announced that ""attacking Iran, in order to stop its nuclear plans, will be unavoidable"".  And now, increasing the temperature another couple of degrees, comes the claim, reported in today's Guardian, that the Syrian site bombed by Israel last September was in fact a joint nuclear venture between Syria, North Korea and Iran. The defence analyst Shmuel Bar, who sits on Israel's national security council, is unambiguous: ""It is 100% certain that the Iranians are on track towards a nuclear weapon and 100% certain that no diplomatic pressure will prevent it."" The Israelis believe this danger is more imminent than anyone else realises. They estimate the Iranians will pass ""the point of no return"" no later than 2010. They are utterly dismissive of sanctions. Bar asks what possible basket of carrots would persuade the Iranians to give up the benefits that would come from acquiring the bomb: ""It would become the hegemon of the region, it would dictate oil prices, it would lead the Muslim world. Against all that, what can you offer?"" All this has apparently led Israel to conclude that it must act, alone if necessary. It harbours no delusions that it could take out the Iranian nuclear programme from the sky, as it did when it bombed Iraq's Osirak reactor in 1981, but it reckons its airforce could do enough damage to ""set back"" the Iranian nuclear effort for a year or two or more.  What to make of all this warlike talk? The simplest option is to take it at face value, to conclude that Israel is indeed going to act and is preparing the ground, militarily and politically. It wants its planes ready and also its arguments, so that if action is timetabled for ""summer-fall 2008"" as one Israeli analyst wrote this week, then it has at least made some effort to brace world opinion for the shock.  This view - that Israel might really mean it - rests on understanding what, for Israel's policymakers and public alike, are a series of givens. First, even though no one doubts that Israel itself is a nuclear power, it still carries a mortal fear of even a single Iranian bomb. That's because it believes the old cold war rules of nuclear balance and mutually assured destruction don't necessarily apply in its neighbourhood. Israelis recall the words of the former Iranian president Hashemi Rafsanjani, who in 2001 declared that ""the use of a single atomic bomb has the power to destroy Israel completely, while it will only cause partial damage to the Islamic world"". They took that to mean that Iran is big enough to withstand a nuke, while Israel is so small it would be wiped out with just one bomb. What's more, Israelis worry that a regime with a strong doctrinal belief in martyrdom might not fear national suicide the way that, say, the Soviet Union once did.  It does not help that Iran's current president regularly conjures up the threat of annihilation. There was some dispute over the precise meaning of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's notorious warning that Israel would be wiped off the map, but, as if to avoid any confusion, he repeated the threat earlier this month when he proclaimed that Israel ""is about to die and will soon be erased from the geographical scene"". In seminar rooms in London or Paris, it's easy to hear all this as mere metaphor, not to be taken seriously. But Israelis hear it differently. ""We have a Holocaust complex,"" says David Landau, the former editor of Ha'aretz. Having faced a real attempt at total eradication in living memory it's quite understandable, he says, if Jews feel especially anxious when a sworn enemy starts threatening obliteration. Nor does it help that the Iranian president targets this most neuralgic spot, repeatedly questioning the historic truth of the Holocaust. The result is that Israelis do not assess risk and probability like other states. It may not be an iron certainty that Iran wants to acquire a nuclear bomb that it will then hold over Israel's head - but if there is so much as a risk, says Landau, that is too much to live with. After 2003, those watching from afar become sceptical when they hear doomsday talk of weapons of mass destruction - especially after December's US national intelligence estimate said the Iranian nuclear quest had been on hold for four years. Indeed, western intelligence agencies are said to be wary of sounding the alarm these days, chastened by their Iraq error. But the experience that haunts Israeli intelligence was the opposite, its underestimate of the threat in 1973 that led to the Yom Kippur war. It's underplaying a danger, not overplaying it, that Israel's military establishment now seeks to avoid.  There is an alternative way to read the current situation. It would see all the latest, apparently bellicose, moves as goads by the Israelis to spur the rest of the world into action: ""Act now,"" they are saying, ""because if you don't, we might just do something crazy."" That warning is surely worth taking seriously, if only because the consequences of military action against Iran are awful to contemplate. Iran would unleash a fierce retaliation, with American soldiers in next-door Iraq the first target. Tehran could choke the world's oil supply through the Gulf, then use its enormous influence not only to destabilise Iraq but to dispatch its proxies around the world on a campaign of attacks on civilian targets, with Hamas and Hizbullah forming the first wave. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog, Mohammed ElBaradei, has warned that a military strike would turn the region into a ""ball of fire"".  A world anxious to avoid that outcome either has to bet that, when it comes to it, Israel will duck confrontation and learn to live with a nuclear Iran - or it must find another way to prevent Tehran getting a bomb. Despite Israel's avowed scepticism, that can only mean diplomacy and the sanctions process.  One British official admits that the current effort is ""only scratching the surface"". The west has shut off access to the dollar, the pound and the euro - but it barely hurts the Iranians, who are awash in cash thanks to the soaring price of oil.  What's needed are sharper sticks and juicier carrots, including tolerance for an Iranian role in neighbouring Iraq and Afghanistan. The current western posture - no talks until Iran suspends its nuclear effort - surely cannot hold: Iran loses nothing by carrying on its quest. Tehran is not yet being forced to make a tough choice. It has to and soon - before Israel makes an even tougher one. freedland@theguardian.com",Jonathan Freedland: The west has to tackle Tehran - before Israel sends in the bombers,2008-06-24T23:01:00Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"When John Lyon, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, gets round to asking the Tory party chairman about her former childcare arrangements, could he check a couple of things which were unaccountably overlooked by Newsnight's Michael Crick? First: does Spelman have a working number for Tina Haynes (a few million working mothers would thank him for it)? Or, failing that, contact details for any other nanny who will work for food? By far the most intriguing aspect of this case to anyone who has ever paid for childcare is Spelman's incredible luck, or skill, in finding a person neither born into slavery nor related by blood who would do the job for nothing. Of course, working mothers have always known that caring for our babies while we are being paid is such a noble undertaking that, in a better world, their minders would consider it less an occupation than an honour.  But Spelman's arrangement with Haynes is thought to be the first recorded example of a nanny actually endorsing this opinion; a development so promising that Haynes's name has already entered the nanny hall of fame, alongside Nana, Poppins, Crawfie and the one who slept with Jude Law. At a time when other live-in nannies were earning, perhaps, £200 a week (it was 10 years ago), Ms Haynes's gladly obliged the little Spelmen, morning and evening, for nothing more, the Conservative party still maintains, than accommodation, meals and use of a car. Given the uncertain value of a spare bed in the Spelmans' village home, and that Ms Haynes can rarely have been at liberty to attract envious glances in the Spelman people carrier, what with the ever-present possibility of former leader William Hague wanting to leave one of his lengthy, bi-annual messages ('That's haitch for Hecuba, A for arduous, G for spot ...'), the only grey area in this arrangement is meals. Just how many calories, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards will no doubt want to know, was Ms Haynes encouraged to consume in lieu of a wage? How often? And, crucially, in what form? If it were easier to imagine the compensatory splendours of the Spelman-filled refrigerator, bursting with rare nuggets and gourmet chipolatas, one might be less inclined to wonder if it wasn't, in reality, a more standard variety of payment, courtesy of the taxpayer, that made Miss Haynes tolerate working conditions which would otherwise have appeared beneath a 19th-century scullery maid. Although it must be said, neither arrangement shows Caroline Spelman in the best possible light. Did she exploit her nanny by paying her in fish fingers? Or exploit taxpayers by paying her nanny with their money? To Spelman's champions, both scenarios will seem equally irrelevant. If mistakes were made, it has been persuasively pointed out, they were hardly on the fabulous scale of her male colleagues, from Derek Conway's handouts to his unspeakable sons, to the Tory MEP Giles Chichester's routing of £445,000 of public money into his own map company, and his colleague, Tory MEP Den Dover's payment into his personal economy of such prodigious sums that the prospect of their sudden cessation has provoked real fears of recession among traders in the once-affluent Chorley area. How can a short-lived, kitchen-based muddle by a well-meaning working mother be compared with the kind of sustained redistribution of wealth that, after years of mystery about their purpose, has now been exposed as the primary, indeed solitary, function of our Tory representatives in Europe? And one that is presumably endorsed by David Cameron, self-styled hammer of the 'something-for-nothing culture', since these proud public servants remain unchallenged in their seats. Possibly her role as chairman of the party once brought down by sleaze explains some of the public interest in Spelman's fix. Which might have attracted more sympathy had she been more frank to begin with about the circumstances which led to a trained nanny, rather than a secretary, being employed, 140 miles from her constituency, to do 30 hours' office work a week (although this is not how Ms Haynes initially described her occasional telephone-answering). The most tender-hearted fellow-martyr may also struggle with Spelman's inability to recall how long the unorthodox arrangement with Haynes lasted (two years rather than, as initially asserted, one), until it was terminated on the advice of her own party's chief whip. In fact, Spelman's pained 'I don't know how I do it' apologia last week reminded some listeners of nothing so much as Cherie Blair's account of the way too much juggling can lead so easily to a harassed working mum inadvertently relying on a scumbag to do her property speculation. Then there was a hint, too, in the expressions of support for Spelman, of the Clinton defence, i.e. this is all about sexism, when we should really be cheering the emergence of the first presentable woman Tory in history. Why, if not because of misogyny, is Spelman now subject to the kind of scrutiny that will not be applied to a dewlapped MEP until he has been spotted having banknotes stuffed down his throat? Why should public investment in the Folletts' sparkling windows, Mandelson's shower and Beckett's pergola be so more easily forgiven than public contributions of the chairman's essential childcare? Leaving aside questions of legality, and the fact that Mrs Beckett's pergola is known to have doubled as a trusted style adviser, Mrs Spelman still has a case to answer. As the latest Tory 'sleazebuster' to be charged with investigating the affairs of the previous Tory sleazebuster (one fatty Chichester), her own probity would inevitably attract an added quis custodiet ipsos sleazos custodes? sort of interest. But Spelman's supporters are right: her sex does come into it. It is precisely because she is a working mother, as well as a Tory MP, that any free nannying, historic or not, would be so intensely annoying to working parents, mothers in particular, who have never known a minute's childcare they did not pay for. Few taxpayers, however unfair it might be, have had to agonise about access to an affordable, high-quality pergola. But as the new, poverty-conscious Tories will know, only the richest working mothers don't worry about the quality, and cost, of their children's minders. Had Spelman, or her party, ever shown the slightest interest in making childcare costs tax-deductible, she might have some claim to sisterly support. As it is, the Tories have used, like Labour, the transience of childcare problems, and the weariness they induce in mothers, along with understandable indifference in others, as an excuse to leave the whole, unspeakably tedious business to families and the market. It's no wonder, really, they still think nannies will work for food. Not unless you get their passports off them first they don't.","Catherine Bennett: Caroline, tell me, where can I get a nanny like yours?",2008-06-21T23:01:00Z,Catherine Bennett,politics
"On Thursday we were going to Royal Ascot on the 10.35am from Waterloo. This journey west up the Thames used to be a popular way of Londoners finding their rural souls, getting in touch with the ""real England"" that lay upstream of Richmond Bridge. Jerome K Jerome's Three Men in a Boat rowed the route and Kenneth Grahame surely set The Wind in the Willows on the same looping river, somewhere above Maidenhead. At the turn of the last century, according to a history of the Ascot horse races published in 1902, a 150 special trains filled with racegoers would stop at stations where ""tempting baskets of ripe peaches and cherries are thrust in at the windows by country women"". Now there is Heathrow airport and the M25 and the institution for young offenders at Feltham. Still, it was a fine summer's day. Some constants remain. We crossed the Thames at Richmond and again at Staines and boats could be seen. Wooden railway sleepers sweated their mixture of pitch and creosote, and the weeds between the tracks bent in the breeze. Nearly everyone on the train wore a hat, and that would also have been true in 1902. At Waterloo station, platform 12 had drawn hats like a magnet. It was a packed train; women sat knee-to-knee in hats, touching them now and then as if to enjoy the sensation (otherwise invisible to the wearer) that they had one on, or to confirm the fact, while men in top hats and morning dress stood in the carriage aisles. They talked animatedly to their friends and, eventually, even to people they didn't know. At Clapham, still in London, it was a murmur but by the time we reached Ascot it could be described as a hubbub. Still talking and avoiding the touts, we trooped up the wooded path from the station to emerge from the shade on to the sunny heathland where Queen Anne began to race horses in 1711. And now a sight to gladden the heart of any milliner: a sea of hats, hats that had come from buses and cars and stretch limousines as well as trains. Proper hats with brims, absurd hats whose purpose is absurdity, and those small items of headwear called fascinators, which can be feathers or tiny pieces of fabric pinned into the hair or attached to the head by a wire. This year's dress code for the Royal Enclosure specifies that fascinators should be ""substantial"". The code also discouraged dresses that are off the shoulder, halterneck, or held up by spaghetti straps. It says: ""Dresses with a strap of less than one inch and, or, miniskirts are considered unsuitable. Midriffs must be covered and trouser suits must be full length and of matching material and colour."" Every year, Ladies' Day at Ascot strives to provide a fashion story and this year's has done better than most. To think that someone would decree ""substantial fascinators"" and the width of a shoulder strap. Commentators see the Queen's hand at work, as she tries to stem, Canute-like, the incoming tide of fleshy hen parties that laps around the Royal Enclosure's doors. It is typical, they say, of an institution that banned divorcees and insisted on gloves until the 1950s and came round to trouser suits, however long and well-matched, rather late in the day. But when the Queen rode down the course in her carriage at 2pm, the cheering and clapping rang out long before she reached the Royal Enclosure - it could be heard in the cheaper stands known as the Silver Ring, where no dress code applies other than a simple request for some kind of dignity. The Queen herself was well-covered and sober in powder blue. The racing began soon after, but the point of Ladies' Day at Ascot - a point tediously made - is that racing is merely the excuse for fun, the seed for a great bloom of ritual and pleasure.  In one way, it asserts the demarcation lines of an old class system: attendance at the Royal Enclosure depends on knowing people; a ticket to the General Enclosure next door costs £63 and to the Silver Ring £25. The latter is detached, reached down a quiet street of terraced houses, and you might say hidden from view. A pop band plays there, while the former has five silver-haired men playing traditional jazz, though military bands take the stage in both and so far as I could tell there is no great difference in drinking habits.  Last year the five days of Royal Ascot saw off 170,000 bottles of champagne and 160,000 pints of beer. So, in another way, Ascot denies the structures of class by cutting a tunnel through the Victorian hill blocking our view of the 18th century and returning us to a Hogarthian England where rakes, young gentlemen, loafers and princes were all in much the same stew. From the perspective of a 100 years ago, the Ascot of George III's reign was too disgusting for words. ""As the night drew on, every form of vice was freely indulged in, and in a manner the mere repetition of which would shock our present tastes,"" says the history published in 1902. But it wouldn't shock our own today.  Perhaps this is what the Queen is struggling against - trying to forget, too, that what were once merely the most convenient races to Windsor, developed by her Hanoverian ancestors, are now ""Europe's biggest and highest profile corporate hospitality event,"" to quote Ascot's media pack.  The new stands, opened two years ago, are machines for pleasure. Punters throng an atrium filled with escalators, lifts, bars and restaurants. If it weren't for the clothes and the laughter you could be in Terminal Five. On Thursday, as they made their way towards their boxes, I saw Cilla Black and Bruce Forsyth and his wife. ""You look nice, dear,"" he said to an elderly well-wisher in the plainest of dresses and hats. Nearby, some photographers were grouped around a pretty woman wearing a pork-pie hat - literally so, the hat's crown had a model of a brown pie with a slice taken out. ""Why are you wearing that?"" ""I'm really trying to get pork pies back on the map,"" she answered. The day's six races went by. It was time for the closing event, the community singing led by the band of the Life Guards, a senior regiment in the Household Cavalry. A big crowd gathered round the bandstand.  Song books and small plastic Union flags were handed out. We sang Hey Jude, Side by Side, Pack Up Your Troubles, and many other songs that reminded us of our childhood and of our ancestors.  How drunk was the crowd? Quite, but not on the whole very. During a rendition of Molly Malone, a woman next to me said rather sadly that they just didn't have songs like this in West Sussex. Land of Hope and Glory and Rule Britannia brought an energetic waving of flags and the same sense of ambiguous patriotism that can be seen and heard at the Last Night of the Proms.  At various points on the way down to the station, young women were giving away free flip-flops. Earlier, they'd been selling them. Hats are what get the attention at Royal Ascot, but the pain is felt in the feet. Women struggled to remove their high heels in the street, leaning on their friends for support and saying: ""Thank God, I can get these bloody things off at last.""  On the train home, women wore their substantial fascinators with pink flip-flops. Gradually, the heady mixture was diluted at each station as civilians came aboard: more backpacks, fewer hats.  I saw my last Ascot hat changing tube trains at Warren Street. They had dispersed all across London, a tribe only for a day, to be put back into boxes or, with those useful pink flip-flops, into the bin.",Ian Jack: To think that someone would decree the width of a shoulder strap,2008-06-20T23:01:00Z,Ian Jack,uk
"Something tells me Gordon Brown won't be in a party mood next week. June 27 will mark his first anniversary inside No 10, and yet I suspect he won't be cracking open too many bottles of bubbly. He can look on the bright side, noting that he is at least still in the job. Otherwise, he will look back on a year that has been too awful to celebrate. After the double punch meted out at the local elections and at Crewe and Nantwich in May, the talk was of giving Brown the shove. That seemed cruelly unfair. Surely a prime minister deserves at least a year in office before facing judgment.  Now that time is up. A settled view, among the electorate as well as the commentariat has formed, one that will take an earthquake to shake. I can see its distortions and exaggerations and yet, no matter how much I would like to, I cannot depart from the substance of it. I find myself in sympathy with those who admired Brown through his 10 long years as chancellor and who keenly awaited his premiership, and yet now conclude that they got Brown wrong - that, on the current evidence, he is simply not up to the job.  At its most basic, he seems to lack the skills of a man who would lead a 21st-century nation. ""He came in like an Oxford don, with a study full of files and papers on the floor,"" laments one minister, who now regrets listening to the Brownites who persuaded him to back their man a year ago. ""He's a dinosaur,"" the minister adds, lamenting Brown's failure to delegate, his dithering, his days that start - or end - at 4am.  The most obvious skill gap is in communication. Brown always delivered a speech like an automatic weapon, but his admirers preferred not to notice. They imagined that the wittier, thoughtful man they knew in private would somehow reveal himself to the public once he became prime minister (even if he had never broken surface before).  That has not happened. Brown still reads, rather than delivers a speech, his head down. He does not seem able to deliver three or four plain, human sentences that anyone could understand. The result is an empathy gap: he does not seem able to show any to the electorate and so they don't feel any for him.  None of this should have come as a surprise: the lack of presentational skills was visible a year ago. But plenty of us thought it might not matter. We reckoned Brown could make a virtue of his lack of glitz, offering himself as a figure of rocklike solidity in a fast and often fake world: ""Not flash, just Gordon.""  That approach could have worked. But it was fatally undermined by Brown himself. Having held back for those first three, sunny months, he fell into tricksiness and political game-playing. So he rubbished the Tories' proposed cut in inheritance tax, then copied it. He popped up in Baghdad during the Conservative party conference, promising troop withdrawals from Iraq. The effect was to show that Brown was as much of a calculating schemer as anyone else in his trade - he just wasn't very skilful or subtle at it. Not flash, just a politician. All this came to a head of course with last autumn's phantom election. Besides the machinations clearly designed to give him a poll lead, the uncertainty created a new part of the Brown persona: that he was indecisive.  Still, it wasn't the eventual failure to call an election that did the damage. It was Brown's presentation of it, the rictus smile as he insisted that the tightening opinion polls had nothing to do with his decision. Reporters told him to come off it, snorting their derision. It was like watching a teacher lose the discipline of his class - once gone, it can never be recovered. (Even through Iraq and all the rest, such a moment never befell Tony Blair.) One minister compares it to Bill Clinton's handling of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. ""It wasn't the blowjob that did the damage; it was Clinton saying he 'did not have sexual relations with that woman'."" Brown could have survived ducking the election; his mistake was to be dishonest about it. But it's not only a weakness in political warcraft that counts against him. One year on, Brown has to be judged by his record. In too many areas, he has been guilty of the very triangulation voters had grown so tired of under Blair. He drove through the abolition of the 10p tax band, seeking to win the plaudits of the tax-cutters, even at the expense of the poorest - thereby trampling on his reputation as the champion of the vulnerable. He has trashed the principle of habeas corpus in order to outflank the Tories on security, by locking people up for 42 days without telling them what they are supposed to have done.  After a hopeful start last summer, when he seemed to signal a break from his predecessor, Brown has retreated into a kind of cautious Blairism. Monday's joint press conference with George Bush was a case in point. When he first met the president last year, Brown stood a welcome arm's length away from him, frostily describing their talks as ""full and frank"". But on Monday, he was in Blair mode, lavishing praise on Bush, insisting that they were best pals with not a flicker of daylight between them. There have been similar retreats into the Blairite comfort zone, or at least indecision, on public service reform. No less damning is the list of what Brown has not done. When caged in the Treasury, he itched to be in charge, such was the scale of his dreams for the country. Those who met him left convinced he was ready to act big. Surely he would pull all the troops out of Iraq. Or he would be ambitious on constitutional reform, driving through a fully elected second chamber or leading Britain, at long last, towards a written constitution. Others imagined that he would solve Labour's cash woes - and the party is currently too broke to fight an election - at a stroke, by introducing state funding of political parties.  None of it happened, even though his own policy team drew up radical plans. On the constitution, he offered grand rhetoric but that translated into steps such as citizens' juries that even one of his own aides admits are ""pathetic"". In this area, as in so many others, Brown has been held back by his own lack of the quality that fascinates him so much he has written a book on it - courage.  Does this mean those who backed him last year, and long before, got him wrong? Not wholly. They were right that he is a decent man, clever and phenomenally widely read; and that, even now, if he ditched the triangulation and crude stunts, pushed a programme of two or three large, bold policies, and told a convincing story about getting the country through economic turmoil - if he did all that, he could still turn things around.  But they - we - misread too much. One cabinet colleague admits mistaking Brown's tactical canniness for strategic grasp. Others failed to see his lack of bravery. One fellow minister says Labour underestimated the co-dependency of the Blair-Brown relationship. Brown needed his rival, if only to push against. Without him, he is lost.  Even the prime minister's closest allies say what has happened these past 12 months is ""tragic"". It would take a Shakespeare to do justice to a story that combines the jealousy of Othello, the ambition of Macbeth and the indecision of Hamlet. Labour's task is not simply to watch this saga play out to its bitter end, but to act - and to help this desperately flawed hero change his destiny. freedland@theguardian.com","Jonathan Freedland: A year in, it's clear: we got Brown wrong.

"Eurosceptics celebrate a triumph of the little people against the Euro juggernaut. Ireland's 'no' vote against the treaty on the European constitution is, in such minds, the brave assertion of democracy against bureaucracy. The European elite in Brussels, with its dark plans to hobble Europeans everywhere, deserves a good kicking for producing an unloved, incomprehensible set of reforms. It has got it. Ireland has stood up for Europe. This is nonsense from top to bottom, a farrago of lies and disinformation. The European Union is a painfully constructed and fragile skein of compromises that allows 27 democratic states on our shared continent to come together and drive forward areas of common interest to further their citizens' well-being. The elite that plots this is a nonexistent phantom invented by populist demagogues. The beleaguered, unloved treaty would have improved Europe's effectiveness and tried to address its much talked about democratic weaknesses. The reality is that Ireland's 'no' voters have trashed an EU that is precious but weak. Most 'no' voters, grabbing on to the worst fear rather than reasoned fact, have unknowingly set in train a political dynamic that, unless carefully handled, could lead not just to Ireland but Britain leaving the EU. Everybody will be the poorer. Sometimes, fatalistically, I think this may have to happen. Eurosceptics, such as Ireland's leading 'no' vote campaigner Declan Ganley, like to position their fierce and unjustified attacks on the actual Europe we have as being pro-European because today's EU does not correspond to some impossible notion of Europe that meets their own very particular prejudices. Such is the flaw of referendums as a means to practise reasoned democratic decision-making that the only way voters will come to realise that the sceptics are wrong is to be forced to live through the consequences of their vote. For although the first reaction in Ireland, Brussels and the rest of the European Union has been to say that the will of Ireland's voters must be respected, the wider political logic is that Irish voters are in effect saying no to the European Union, a will that can only be respected by other states freezing their ambitions. Ireland's voters have primed a bomb. Thinking through the options shows just how big the bomb is. Eighteen states have already ratified the treaty, some for the second time. The first reaction of José Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, was to ask the last eight member states, Britain included, to proceed with ratification. Gordon Brown has agreed; the final reading is on Wednesday and to stop the process because of the Irish vote would be unreasonable. The European Council of heads of state meets this week and will surely re-endorse that collective view. So the EU on 1 January 2009 will have a treaty that 26 states have ratified - but not the Irish. A new commission is to be appointed, supposedly on a new basis, as well as a new president, along with a strengthened foreign policy chief. So what is to happen? What can't happen is that the treaty is scrapped, rewritten to accommodate changes to meet the will of Ireland's voters and then re-ratified in 27 countries. There are the practical questions of time and expense and there is no political readiness in the other 26 capitals to go through the whole interminable process again.  On top of these there is the political problem that the treaty can't be rewritten to accommodate specific Irish concerns because it already does; Ireland's 'no' campaigners told lies. The voters' great concerns had been met. There is a specific protocol that guarantees Ireland's neutrality and excuses it from membership of any joint European defence effort, if any surfaces. There is no possibility of Ireland being told to enforce abortion. And all states have autonomy over tax policy. Crucially, the treaty contains a clause that states that do not agree to its provisions are required to leave the European Union. The existing treaty can certainly be made more obviously Ireland-friendly within its existing provisions, but beyond that, the EU will have to get tough and invoke the clause. It will have to ask Ireland to resubmit essentially the same treaty for a second referendum early in 2009, rather as Ireland held a second referendum over the Nice treaty in 2002. If Ireland votes similarly again, then it will have to accept associate status in the EU and not be a member of its governing structures. The EU will proceed without Ireland. Nobody wants this outcome and the language at this week's European Council will be carefully diplomatic. Senior British government sources have told me that the EU has to be 'respectful' of the Irish vote and not be portrayed in any way as a bully that disregards the popular will. This may be possible for a few months, but the clock is ticking. Decisions cannot be deferred. Sometime during the autumn, the President of the European Commission or the Irish Prime Minister must spell out Ireland's choices. Irish and British Eurosceptics, in close alliance, will react in fury. I can see it now. This will be proof-positive of the Brussels elite's malevolence and anti-democratic intent. David Cameron's Tory party will say that Ireland is being treated disgracefully. I don't see how Cameron will be able to avoid a pledge to give British voters the same chance for a referendum on the treaty as the Irish, not least to strengthen the hand of the Irish 'no' campaigners in their second referendum. One of Europe's big states will be on Ireland's side when the Tories win power. They can take on Brussels bullies etc. Battle is going to be joined in earnest because it must. Pro-Europeans everywhere must engage. We need this Europe - to fight climate change, to ensure security of energy and food, to underwrite our prosperity and to fight for our common interests.  The world needs it too. The EU is the citizens' friend. If it did not exist, Europe would have to invent something similar. Over the next few months, Europe's leaders are going to have to develop concrete initiatives to support these points and to present what they are doing as European and only possible because of the EU. Maybe pro-Europeans can win Ireland's second referendum and then, in 2010 or 2011, our own. But referendums work best for the demagogue, the dissimulator and scaremonger, as Hitler and Mussolini, lovers of referendums, proved. Increasingly, Ireland and Britain are heading for the European exit and that could portend further break-up of the Union. Pro-Europeans look out.",Will Hutton: Europe must not be derailed by lies and disinformation,2008-06-14T23:01:00Z,Will Hutton,world
"If, as they say, you can judge a country by how it treats its children's commissioners, there is certainly reason for hope. Obviously one does not in a place like the UK expect to find anything approaching Scandinavian levels of commissioner well-being, but reports suggest that these officials are increasingly likely to be well-fed and housed, with a number achieving the desired grades A to C at GCSE. With the news that mosquito devices have been banned by Kent County Council, there is evidence that commissioners are, at last, being listened to. While some discrimination persists - many small shopkeepers still refuse to have more than two commissioners on their premises at any one time - there is evidence of increasingly high levels of self-esteem, demonstrated last week in the UK commissioners' new report to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child. 'The fact that we exist,' they begin, 'is evidence of some progress.' Indeed, when you consider how often we now hear from the children's commissioner for England, Sir Al Aynsley-Green, you wonder what we did for child-related lamentation before 2005. Although children's rights were already established at that time, as were a number of prominent campaigners for childhood and children, it was rare, before Sir Al's chilling conspectuses became a fixture of the Today programme, to hear the singular horror that is a British childhood accepted as a fact beyond dispute and the 'demonisation' of all British children repeated, as it was again last week, as an axiom. It is courtesy of Sir Al, and his mission to have England recognised as 'one of the most child- and young person-unfriendly countries in the developed world', that allusions to demonisation are now as routine when miserable children are discussed as a reference to malnutrition or illiteracy might have been in the old days. No sooner had he started in the job than Sir Al declared his role-models to be 'Coram, Dickens, Barnardo, Rowntree', reformers who were, as he evidently planned to be, 'outraged by what they saw'. That a child can no longer be hanged for stealing a loaf or, for that matter, sent out to work, or beaten for talking in class, is immaterial: Sir Al has identified a new catalogue of abuses, some of which make the Artful Dodger's routine look positively child-centred. So he had to live with Fagin? At least Fagin never made him do Sats every three or four years: the 'endless testing', as the endlessly outraged Sir Al puts it. And even when 19th-century children were at their most tormented, exploited and deported, they could at least enjoy the bit of spiritual status that comes of being purer than any grown-up: '... trailing clouds of glory do we come/ From God, who is our home.' Instead of a dazzled Wordsworth, the modern infant can look forward to nothing, Sir Al points out, but insults and disrespect from a society which - lest we forget - confuses children with agents of evil. That demonisation is not something that lends itself to very precise measurement; that it might, even, loom larger inside Dr Al Aynsley-Green's head than in the real world has not prevented it becoming an official term. 'Demonisation: a major issue for society,' began a discussion paper produced by 11million.org.uk, Sir Al's website for children. It proposed 'redressing the balance' with a 'children's takeover day' (the plan, I understand, involved compulsory screenings of Harry Potter..., salary increases for Ant and Dec and nonstop TV talent contests in which adults would be ritually humiliated by mediocre child prodigies). After three years of repetition, demonisation has evidently entered the discrimination lexicon, a bit like marginalisation or institutional racism, only worse. 'Scotland shares with the rest of the UK a public attitude towards children and young people that tends to demonise them,' state the UK commissioners in their new report, in a list headed, presumably for child-friendly reasons, 'Bad Things About Being a Child in Scotland'. Mercifully and perhaps surprisingly, given the piercing and unmodulated nature of Sir Al's exclamations, the new report, addressing 'the reality of children's lives', does mention a few non-horrific things about British childhood. Under 'Good Things About Being a Child in England', we discover, for example, that 'the majority of children say they are happy'. Another accepted indicator for childish well-being is ticked off with: 'The majority of children up to age 15 say that their general health is either good or very good.' Most say they 'feel safe from being hurt'. Most 'are engaged, motivated and making a positive contribution, for example, volunteering, helping in the community and peer mentoring'. You might think, in the context of the mass demonisation occurring within 'one of the most child- and young person-unfriendly countries in the developed world', that these findings, drawn from Ofsted's 2007 survey of 111,000 children, are nothing short of miraculous. The children's commissioners, however, remain resolutely unimpressed. Although Ofsted's survey of last November is allowed, in a muted kind of way, to modify the impact of a preceding and much more widely publicised UN report, which contrasted the lot of the UK's miserable lumpkins unfavourably with that of those bright sparks from Slovenia, the children's commissioners will not be deflected from their opinion that, where children's rights are concerned, 'some things are actually worse'. A long list of bad things about being a child ranges from the obviously unforgivable - the neglect of disabled children, damaging poverty, premature criminalisation - to preoccupations which seem rather more peculiar to the average children's commissioner, and that limited number of children likely to be affected by mosquito devices and knife-searching arches. Sir Al has already, of course, condemned both gadgets, since they contribute to a 'demonising of children and young people' which reduces him, he has said, to despair.  You begin to wonder if Sir Al, steeping himself in the history of childhood, ever read about the unfortunate Matilda, who told lies and was burnt to death. Possibly not or it would not be so easy to picture Sir Al leaning out of a burning building and shouting: 'Fire! Fire!' Or: 'Demonisation! Demonisation!' Whatever. It's not the words so much as the habit of screaming and bawling about the wrong things that could end up with the response to a genuine alarm being like Belloc's: 'For every time she shouted, ""Fire!""/ They only answered, ""Little liar!""' In the case of the truthful Sir Al, one might be more inclined to say: 'Oh why must you always be such a Cassandra when the Ofsted report, a sense of proportion and the most cursory attempt at a long view all point to the wisdom of campaigning on specifics? That's the way you'll get something done!' Only there would not be time. And in any case, the question would certainly be drowned out by the sound of Sir Al telling the BBC how awful everything is in this, the worst of all possible children's worlds.",Catherine Bennett: Spare us these commissioners bewailing the lot of the young,2008-06-14T23:01:00Z,Catherine Bennett,society
"Like a sprightly old soldier over-dressed in medal ribbons, Gregory Burke's play Black Watch comes to London next week after a two-year campaign that has conquered hundreds of audiences and won over almost every critic who has seen it. A production of the National Theatre of Scotland, it opened to wonderful notices at the Edinburgh festival in 2006. Since then it has toured the US, Australia, New Zealand, as well as many British towns that rarely see visits from touring theatre companies: Dingwall, Ebbw Vale, Dumfries, Glenrothes. The people of Dingwall saw it at the town's Highland Football Academy; Pitlochry paid witness at an old hydraulics laboratory. That London should come so low down the list - a postscript to New York, Sydney, Toronto and Los Angeles - has been interpreted as Scotland giving the finger to the capital's cultural and political establishment. This is the play, after all, that Alex Salmond commanded to be performed not once but three times to celebrate the opening of the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish National Party's first crack at government. And who needs London's sniff of approval when New York is eating from your hand? In fact, the real reason for its metropolitan absence is more theatrical than political. The National Theatre of Scotland rejected an early invitation from the South Bank because the play needs an open arena with the audience banked up on two sides, which neither the Olivier nor the Lyttelton can provide. And so on Friday, better late than never, it begins its one-month London run at the Barbican. In April, I went to see it at the Scottish Exhibition Centre in Glasgow. There's no point in pretending that I didn't know what to expect, but the danger with ecstatic reviews and copious publicity is that they tend to promote in a certain kind of personality (perhaps Scottish, perhaps mine) the thrawn desire to disagree. Ben Brantley, the New York Times critic, wrote of Black Watch that it had arrived ""like a blazing redeemer in the greyness of the current New York theatre season, a cause for hope after a surfeit of microwaved revivals and ersatz musicals . . . a necessary reminder of the transporting power that is unique to theatre"". John Heilpern in the New York Observer said it was ""among the most compelling theatre pieces you could wish to see"". It is as Heilpern says. Black Watch is a compelling play, though not because its stagecraft or theatrical ideas are blazingly original: the idea that the experience of ""ordinary people"" can be told on stage though an episodic mixture of dialogue and song, dancing and marching, is at least as old as Oh! What a Lovely War, first performed by Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop in 1963. Ten years later, The Cheviot, the Stag and the Black, Black Oil by John McGrath's 7:84 company documented Highland history, and thrilled crowds in Scottish village halls in an ambitious touring programme that finds an echo in the National Theatre of Scotland's present philosophy, which is to reach audiences beyond cities and proscenium arches. Also, as I walked that April evening to Black Watch's Glasgow venue - a big exhibition hall built over the site of the old Queen's Dock - I remembered the only other play I'd seen so close to the banks of Clyde. Bill Bryden's The Ship filled Harland and Wolff's abandoned engineering shed just over the river in the autumn of 1990. Every night a seeming-ship was built by seeming-workmen and then, at the play's end, seemingly launched, sliding down a slipway before your very eyes. A true coup de théâtre - nothing so sensational had been seen in Glasgow since an Edwardian river floated canoes across the stage of the Empire - though it crowned a dramatic memorial to the Glasgow working class that was utterly conventional in its fond characterisation. Nothing new, then, in the techniques in Black Watch; John Tiffany, the play's director, is happy to acknowledge the precedents in his introduction to Burke's script. As for its subject matter, the Iraq war and the politics around it are hardly virgin territory for screenwriters and playwrights. David Hare did Stuff Happens at the National, Victoria Brittain and Gillian Slovo wrote Guantanamo for the Tricycle. In both, the writers researched real people and real events and then re-created them, more or less scrupulously, within the constrictions of drama. In its origins, Black Watch is no different. In 2004, Vicky Featherstone, the National Theatre of Scotland's artistic director, asked Burke to follow the story of the regiment. That autumn, at American request, a Black Watch battalion had been temporarily redeployed from the relative safety of British-occupied Basra to Camp Dogwood near Fallujah. The move was politically controversial. At Dogwood, the Black Watch came under sustained rocket and mortar fire. In November, three soldiers and an interpreter were killed by a car bomb at a vehicle checkpoint. A month later, the Ministry of Defence announced that the Black Watch was to be amalgamated with five other Scottish regiments to become the Third Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Scotland. Local outrage ensued. People sometimes forget that Scotland has a strong tradition of militarism - three centuries of blood and death in the British cause that has been made folksy and cuddly by the kilts, pipes and drums of the Edinburgh Tattoo. The Black Watch was first raised as an anti-Jacobite militia in 1725 and its battle honours include Corunna, Waterloo, Arras, Vimy, Passchendaele and almost every major British action in the second world war. Its dark green and blue tartan and its hat feather, the red hackle, make it the most distinctive of Scottish regiments. Given what the British government was asking the Black Watch to do in the desert of Iraq, the decision was seen as a betrayal, a poor piece of bureaucratic judgment that would damage the Black Watch's already sinking morale. This is the story that Burke tells. It could have been told as an anti-war polemic or a fresh enshrinement of a glorious military legend. Both elements are present in the play and the tension between them is never resolved - ""good regiment, bad war"" is the message that some in the audience might take home. Some of the play's power lies in this very opposition, between what armies actually do, which is often brutal, and the attractions of their history and traditions, which are sometimes brave. The officer in the play calls the second ""the Golden Thread"", a kind of ancestor worship inculcated into teenage recruits who may have been attracted in the first place by mystical totems such as red hackles and regimental pipe tunes, which the army describes as ""force multipliers"" (meaning that they help recruitment, or once did). Burke deals fairly with these seductive ideas of identity and never reduces them to a satirical caricature. We see that they continue to hold meaning for young men placed in absurd and terrifying circumstances. But it is Burke's depiction of the young men themselves, brought to life with unsettling veracity by a fine group of actors, that makes Black Watch so illuminating and affecting. In a country that pays its traffic wardens more than its soldiers, where the young sit fatly before their PlayStations, where deference and jump-to-it obedience belong in the museum of behaviours, how do you raise a volunteer army? Where do you look? In the introduction to the published version of the play, Burke writes: ""The army does not recruit well in London or any other big city. Metropolitanism and multiculturalism are not the things that are welded into a cohesive fighting force."" According to the Ministry of Defence, the army does best in areas of the country that have ""settled communities"": in other words, in white, monoglot places, not necessarily rural, where the old ways of earning money - mining, fishing, textiles, shipbuilding - no longer exist. In Scotland, so Burke says, soldiering and banking (I would add lawyering and teaching) are the only significant indigenous industries to have lasted into the 21st century. The ""settled communities"" that the Black Watch draws on are the city of Dundee and the old counties of Angus, Perthshire and Fife. When I was at school in Fife, our geography books told us that the county we lived in produced coal, linen, linoleum, paper, ships and fish. These made it matter to the world beyond. Very little of this still applies, but since 2003 there has been a trickle of new Fife exports to Iraq, including the three Black Watch men who died at the checkpoint in 2004: Private Scott McArdle, aged 22, from Glenrothes; Private Paul Lowe, aged 19, and Sergeant Stuart Gray, aged 31, both of Dunfermline. Burke, also from Dunfermline, interviewed surviving members of the same battalion (without the army's approval) during his research. Their words make the play. The accents of Fife are caught precisely. The language is brutal. In the opening scene, Cammy (Private Campbell) teases the anti-war folk who describe the army as ""big bullies"". Cammy: ""Well, we'll need to get fucking used tay it. Bullying's the fucking job. That's what we have a fucking army for."" The action moves back and forth between a Fife pub and Camp Dogwood. There are some funny lines. Inspecting a Dogwood wall that has been plastered with pornography, an officer says, ""It's important that we have a reminder of what we're here fighting for. Porn and petrol."" Inside a Warrior armoured car, the soldiers pass the time of day by naming the first food they'll eat when they get home. Each man has a turn to name one dish. It has to be Indian. Only after the Indian takeaway menu has been exhausted can they move on to ""Chinky"". A kind of game, like Mornington Crescent. ""Cheese on toast,"" says one man. ""Cheese on fucking toast?"" says another. ""Aye."" ""You cannay hay cheese on fucking toast."" ""How fucking no?"" ""Cos you cannay."" ""How no?"" ""It's no a fucking Indian, is it?"" ""It's fucking food."" As much as anything else, Black Watch is a requiem for a military system that depended on the bonds of locality and history for its comradeship. Men fight for their regiment, their company, their platoon, their mates. Countries - Britain or Scotland - and governments never come into it. It's easy to imagine what men like these say to each other after their fellow Fifer, Gordon Brown, has got back into his helicopter. Towards the play's end, Cammy's officer tries to persuade him to stay in the regiment. ""It's in the blood . . . It's part of who we are, where we come from,"" the officer says. Cammy replies that people have said that about a lot of things - ""the shipyards, the pits"". Why should the army be any more permanent? ""It's fucking knackered. Don't you think it's knackered, sir?"" The officer answers: ""It takes 300 years to build an army that's admired and respected around the world. But it only takes three years pissing about in the desert in the biggest western foreign policy disaster ever to fuck it up completely."" The question is: should we mourn its passing? Leaving the play, I thought of my grandfather who served with the Royal Scots in Flanders; at that time, the Royal Scots rather than the Black Watch were what you might call Fife's premium regiment and quite a few of my ancestors were conscripted to it. My grandfather was wounded. He survived far worse scenes than Camp Dogwood. In 1919, he went back to the pits. What I remember about him are his tidy habits and his gentleness: a civilised man among millions who thought and behaved similarly. Something happened to that civilisation long before the Iraq war. The Black Watch's boy-men who fought in it are the legatees of a social destruction that might be grieved over more than the end of a regiment, even though the regiment is among the last survivors of that previous world. · Black Watch is at the Barbican, London EC2, from June 20 to July 26.

"The Pain and the Privilege: The Women in Lloyd George's Life  Ffion HagueHarperPress £25, 608pp Ffion Hague is, by all accounts, far too astute to have married William without considering the role of the politician's wife. Back then, Hague was the coming man and it must have seemed reasonable to suppose she would one day be running 10 Downing Street, thus restoring the Welsh establishment to the centre of British affairs. To Ffion Hague, as to all true Welsh nationalists, Lloyd George is a god, a status that makes censure of his rabid and exploitative sexual appetite apostasy. He was undeniably a political genius. He was also an extraordinary philanderer, surely the last ever to be prime minister, for in the doublespeak world of Westminster, sex remains scandalous even as the marriage rate plummets. But to Hague, Lloyd George's women are strictly handmaidens to the Welsh Wizard. She acknowledges his manipulative streak but she believes the women in question, strong, intelligent individuals, went into it with their eyes open and ultimately gained from their relationships. Hence the privilege and the pain. When Lloyd George was courting Maggie Owen, he warned her: ""My supreme idea is to get on. To this idea I shall sacrifice everything - except, I trust, honesty. I am prepared to thrust even love itself under the wheels of my Juggernaut, if it obstructs the way."" A quarter of a century later, he set out even more brutally the terms of engagement with another young, single woman. Early in their relationship he gave to Frances Stevenson a biography of Charles Parnell, whose political career was destroyed when his affair with Kitty O'Shea became public. It was a warning: there would be no divorce from Maggie, no sacrificing of ambition to mere love. Lloyd George made love to many women. He had sustained relationships with several. But he remained married to Maggie for more than 50 years, and for 30 of those years Frances was his mistress. It is the complexity of these relationships, the unexpected mutual contributions and the shameless manipulation by the man his enemies called the Goat, that makes this such an unexpectedly engaging portrait. Lloyd George was the greatest political personality of his age, bold, radical, witty. He loved women, and long before he became a national figure, women loved him. Maggie's hesitation in committing herself to him was partly because her parents disapproved. But it was also because the man she loved began building his reputation as a womaniser before he was out of his teens. Within months of their marriage, he had begun his first adulterous affair. Although that was successfully hidden from Maggie, she realised soon enough that the honesty that her husband expected from her would not be reciprocated by him. He was almost indiscriminate in his search for sexual gratification. It may have been something to do with the constant desire for praise and approval of the radical outsider of humble origins among the society salons of Westminster. Or maybe it was the size of his penis (""the biggest I have ever seen"", an admiring - male - secretary noted many years later). But if Maggie reproached him for his infidelity, he reproached her more. Since she would not live with him in London, she was more or less to blame, he wrote, blithely overlooking the fact that for the first seven years of their marriage there was little more than a year when she was not either pregnant or nursing a baby. There is something drearily familiar in the inability of the spoilt and self-absorbed Lloyd George to accept that Maggie, the mother of his children, whose entire support network was based in north Wales, could not also be Maggie the consort of an up-and-coming political star in London. But there is also something exceptional in Maggie's determination to do what she believed was right for her family, at least until an affair with the wife of a mutual friend appeared to pose a real threat to their marriage - at which point she finally went to London. From 1913 onwards, however, she was sharing her husband with his political ""wife"", Frances Stevenson - a schoolfriend of their beloved oldest daughter Mair Lloyd George, who died of peritonitis when she was only 17. Frances was everything Maggie was not. Twenty-five years younger than her lover and his wife, she was highly educated and good at both domestic comfort and office administration. If Lloyd George was unrepentant about his frequent flings, he was shameless about Frances, who had originally been recruited as a summer governess for his youngest daughter, Megan. Soon she had been inserted into his political staff, first at the Board of Trade, then at the Treasury and ultimately in No 10. In this respect she was a prototype special adviser, a temporary civil servant welded on to the existing team. By committing herself to life as the mistress of a well-married man, Frances thought she was in the vanguard of the early feminism that drove the suffragettes, whose campaign she enthusiastically supported (though not in its violent aspects). She was rejecting convention to live as an independent woman. On one level, she did: she was at the centre of events for nearly 10 years, through political crises, war and peace-making. But, however open a secret her relationship with Lloyd George was in the political world, she was also condemned to a life of hypocrisy and a sad childlessness (there were at least two abortions) until the late arrival of a daughter whose paternity was never quite resolved. And when, after Maggie's death early in 1941, Lloyd George was free to honour his frequent promises to marry her, he sheltered behind the opposition of his daughter Megan, until Frances practically dragged him to the register office in October 1943. Within 15 months, he was dead. There are curious parallels in the lives of these two women. As wife of the prime minister, Maggie developed a career in Welsh politics that made her indispensable to the man from whom she became almost estranged. Similarly, in the last years of her life, long after Lloyd George's death, Frances could reveal the role that she had played as consort of the Welsh Wizard and relive in public the glory that she had lived only secretly. The only disappointment in this absorbing read is that there is not more of Ffion Hague in it. Yet it is clear that, even though she famously met William when he was secretary of state for Wales and she his private secretary (Welsh-speaking, with an MPhil in Welsh literature), her heart is with Maggie, the wronged home-maker, rather than Frances, the clever, independent-minded political aide. But then, the one thing Frances could never be was Welsh.  · Anne Perkins's A Very British Strike is published by Pan.

"Not another failed-schools initiative. When Ed Balls, king of policy fidgets, fell out of his Treasury nest and landed in schools, it was only a matter of time. He may have disliked Thatcherism's academies, foundation trusts and specialist schools, but they were government schools and they were his. They offered him an empire, control and a chance to abuse the detested local councils. Yesterday Balls bought the entire academies package. He now wants 400 of them. Many will replace the 628 secondary schools in England that he claims to know are failing (out of 3,100). He intends to close 270 and merge or replace them with academies or, his latest initiative, 70 ""national challenge trusts"", some grouped under something called an Extra Mile initiative. A failing school, to Balls, is not a private and painful challenge to a few hundred teachers and pupils somewhere in England. It is a unit that has fallen below his arbitrary target of 30% of pupils securing five A*-C grade GCSEs. He has given councils just 50 days to produce ""plans"" to get them back on target, or inspectors or commissioners will intervene to do the job for them.  So-called failures now include a majority of the schools in the cities of Manchester and Bristol, and 33 in Kent, whose grammar schools have clearly left unselected pupils in the lurch. How can it possibly help Myers Grove, Sheffield or Ash Green, Warwickshire, for Balls to publicise their failure on his website and doom them from a distance? He also intends ""further measures"" to root out incompetent teachers and a ""school-by-school assessment of primary education"". What of the last dozen such initiatives?  On one matter Balls is right. Twenty years of secondary reorganisation and an unprecedented injection of cash have failed to deliver. State education in Britain has grown worse over the past decade than in comparable countries. Last December's Pisa study for the OECD was devastating, admitted by Balls as showing that in ""direction of change, we have gone backwards"".  In 2000, Britain was third or fourth in subjects such as reading and science, and is down at 14th or 15th today. From sporting performance to criminality, pregnancy and drug-taking, young people are near the foot of every European league table. Despite astronomical spending on teachers, Britain comes 15th in secondary class size.  It clearly never occurs to ministers that more bureaucratisation and institutional humiliation merely disrupts a school, as it does a hospital. A school is not a football team, always to be threatened with relegation. The league table culture demoralises staff and pupils and poisons the well of local support.  Like his predecessors in his job, Balls is desperate to make a mark before moving on. This means winning headlines, if not from school outputs at least from policy inputs. Balls's conversion to academies and trusts evolved from Thatcher's ""opted out"" schools and city technology colleges, via foundations, specialists, trusts and anything that could offer middle-class voters ""choice"" to escape from urban comprehensives.  Academies, of which 83 are now open, have proved five times more costly to build than equivalent council schools and receive an extraordinary £1,600 a year per pupil more. The National Audit Office said last autumn the taxpayer had spent a staggering £5m to teach each academy pupil that performed above the national cohort average.  Can anything be made of this dog's breakfast? Academies have certainly shifted large amounts of money into schools, and much of it has gone where it is needed, to areas of deprivation and immigration. The early attempts of Tony Blair and his aide Lord Adonis to inflate the academies' performance by letting them choose middle-class parents, failed in a flurry of Labour opposition to such social engineering.  Since nothing so divides communities - anywhere in the world - as socially segregated institutions, this was a battle worth fighting. Except with faith-based schools, the admissions code for fair enrolment is being enforced. The intake of most academies is genuinely comprehensive, and their mixed performance probably reflects this. The evidence is that some do no better and some no worse than their council comparators.  In other words, what many suspected is true - changes in finance, structure and governance do not yield any special educational advantage. There was never any need for this disruptive ""binary"" structure of secondary education. It was a product of the vanity of ministers. The money would have been better spent on making each local school system better resourced and led.  It is 20 years since Nigel Lawson and his schools official, John Anson, set out to bring all schools under Treasury control. That battle still drags bloodily on. Most schools must cater for their immediate communities and know that nothing substitutes for a strong head in tandem with a strong chief education officer. Inspectors can inspect, but performance is ultimately a matter for teachers, parents and local leaders.  The government's obsession with how a school is governed and monitored is a red herring. Overseas experience suggests that the most stable school, primary or secondary, is one firmly rooted in its locality, with governors answerable to a plenipotentiary elected council, preferably small in scale. A neighbourhood school answers to people, a national school answers to statistics. People help, statistics merely humiliate.  A yawning gulf now separates Whitehall's perception of the public realm and that of citizens on the ground. They see familiar institutions pulverised on every side by pseudo-modernisation. Primary and secondary schools are set to go the way of the post office, the cottage hospital, the police station, the surgery and the sports club. I sometimes think the present government's cull of community Britain echoes the same recessive socialist gene as Stalin's assault on the kulaks. Those too long in power develop a loathing of locality.  While some of the now vanishing schools will be replaced with academies and challenge trusts, many will be merged into what every survey warns against: the big school, the grouped school, the school with diluted and uncertain leadership. Balls's approach is neither unique nor new. What is new is the evidence that such manic interventionism does not work. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com · This article was amended on Monday June 23 2008. In the article above, we said academies received £160,000 a year per pupil more than equivalent council schools. That figure should have been £1,600.

"I drove past Harriet Harman's road on Sunday, only I didn't know that at the time, and the proliferation of cameras and coppers led me to conclude that the uniforms were all fake, and they were filming an episode of The Bill. ""Tsk,"" I got as far as thinking, ""don't these scriptwriters realise that crimes don't happen in Herne Hill?"" Well, not crime as such, but Fathers4Justice, dressing up and raging again.  In fact things are, broadly speaking, going in the fathers' direction, from a legislative point of view. Apart from changes to the Child Support Agency, there is a plan for mothers to be obliged to put the father on the birth certificate. The organisation Families Need Fathers, which is very reasonable and shouldn't be tarred with the Fathers4Justice capers, is ""extremely pleased"".  One Parent Families/Gingerbread, the lone-parent charity, is opposed to the idea, on the basis of fairness. Janet Allbeson, the group's policy adviser, points out: ""There isn't equality in terms of who's identifiable as a parent. So if, for instance, the mother doesn't want to have the father's name on the register, because he's reluctant, she's the one who would get the sanction. It's on her that the burden of naming the other parent will lie.""  It's a small, and dwindling, proportion of births that aren't jointly registered anyway (7%). The group is very vulnerable, with an average age of 22, tending to be less well educated, less likely to have qualifications, more likely to be living with parents or in social housing, and more likely to be on benefits. (This is all according to research by the Department for Work and Pensions, which still went ahead and put forward the white paper.)  There are exemptions to this new rule: if the requirement is impossible - that is, you don't know who the father is; or impractical, if he's abroad or on an oil rig or something; or unreasonable, if you've been the victim of domestic violence or the child is the result of a rape. These are fairly broad - anyone who actively doesn't want to put the father down need only say ""impossible"", and what are the authorities going to do? Dunk her down a well till she confesses? Any father who actively doesn't want to be on the certificate need only pressure the mother into claiming an exemption.  So, having little or no practical purpose, it strongly resembles the legislation surrounding abortion - two doctors need to attest to the fact that the pregnancy endangers your mental state. Of course they will do that; the ones who you pay will do it really fast; and of course it's such a broad concept that it's neither true nor untrue. So it has no practical usage. All it does is introduce a layer of difficulty and of tacit censure, so that nobody can have an abortion and think they got away with it scot-free. Society was watching and shaking its head; it wasn't angry, just disappointed.  Let's not forget how tiny the numbers will be of those affected by the new birth certificate laws: 7% of births is about 50,000 a year. Take out all those who don't know the father; who are victims of domestic abuse (lone parents are three times more likely to be abused in this way than those in other types of household); who object to the injunction and claim impossibility ... It's hard to quantify, but you're probably left with 5,000 women, socially, economically, educationally disadvantaged, with an average age of 22, who've just had a baby, dealing with legislation whose only meaningful purpose is to make them feel bad.  And who's this all for? To appease the very small number of fathers who are desperate to be involved with their newborns, and yet the mother, for reasons not related to violence or harassment, won't let them. This is what you get for putting your underpants on over your trousers and capering about on public buildings and Harriet Harman's roof. It's not bad, is it? We should all have a go.  mszoewilliams@yahoo.co.uk",Zoe Williams: The names of the fathers,2008-06-10T23:01:00Z,Zoe Williams,society
"In ""Community Life"", a short story by Lorrie Moore, a woman librarian looks around and realises that compared to her boyfriend's social group, her friends are all a bit wonky. They say sour things in quiet voices and make terrible wardrobe decisions. They are ""delicate and territorial, intellectual, and physically unwell"" but, writes Moore, ""these were the people she liked: the kind you couldn't really live with"". She might be describing her characters in general, who, even when they do find someone to live with, tend to wince at everything they say and then show them up in public. Moore writes in the off-hours, those bits of the day that if she were more delicate she would dismiss as unusable. But between teaching and parenting it is all the time she has and she is as tough as a quarterback at getting down to it. Less so at promoting the results. Over lunch in Manhattan she says she is ""terrible"" at live events, decries her early work as ""not very good"" and reacts, when my voice recorder starts beeping, with ""it means I'm being boring."" Her tone is lightly tremulous - as if resting on a joke that will surface at some point and capsize us all - and although the 51-year-old has been lauded by John Updike, the Guggenheim Foundation and the American Academy of Arts and Letters, among other grand institutions, she knows the value of self-dismissal. In the introduction to her latest book she summarises her fiction thus: ""Too many birds and moons."" The book is a collection of short stories, which have been gathered from Moore's three earlier volumes, Self-Help (1985), Like Life (1990) and Birds of America (1998), as well as excerpts from her novel Anagrams and her contributions to the New Yorker. The stories are arranged in reverse date order which means, Moore says, that the best come first. Her characters are estate agents, academics, small-town lawyers and paediatricians, the odd defunct movie star, who when they aren't doling out mordant put-downs (""She eyed Agnes's outfit as if it might be what in fact it was: a couple of blue things purchased in a department store"") are blinking rapidly to absorb them. They are so self-regarding, so aware of their own ""rented charisma"" as one character puts it, that if you read too many stories in one sitting it induces a kind of negative feedback and you have to lie down. As is often the case with funny writers, particularly women, Moore's seriousness is sometimes overlooked. Ten years ago, Julian Barnes, in his review of Birds of America for the New York Review of Books, wrote that to the ""avian eye of her early books"" Moore had added a ""depth of focus"" and ""emotional seriousness"" that showed her maturing into a fully realised talent. Hers is almost the reverse of Auden's crack in the teacup; more the flash of crockery in the land of the dead. Deborah Treisman, the New Yorker fiction editor, has placed her in the tradition of 19th-century realism, and it's true that in Moore's domestic encounters, large volumes of information are communicated across big rooms via small gestures - small, unreturned gestures that their maker instantly scrambles to cover up. ""Stories are interested in those crisis moments in people's lives,"" Moore says. ""When there's a break in communication. There's that wonderful moment in The Portrait of a Lady, when Isabel Archer walks into a room, sees her husband and Madame Merle just suddenly stop talking, and it all becomes clear. The whole thing is revealed in that moment. Something's broken."" Moore often says in interviews that her real life is too boring to talk about. She grew up in Glen Falls, a small town in upstate New York, and after graduating from St Lawrence University lived for a couple of years in Manhattan before moving west. For the past 25 years she has lived in Madison, Wisconsin, where she teaches creative writing at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and suffers bouts of claustrophobia and the occasional backlash that comes from being a well-known writer in a relatively small community. When she first moved there, she says, she felt so overwhelmed by professorial life that she tried to cultivate a flameproof persona. ""I had such a reaction to the academic culture that I used to ask myself, what would Goldie Hawn do? Because I thought she was completely unflappable."" But she says there is also a lot to like about the place, not least the breathing space that it has allowed for her writing. When she was growing up, Moore wrote stories about ""crazy magical things - things flying off into space to different planets and stuff"". Her teachers seemed to like them, though she says: ""I don't know that they were any good."" Her father worked in insurance and her mother trained as a nurse. They were both creative, which, perversely, made them less enthusiastic about their daughter's preferred career path; creativity was something you did in your spare time. Moore has vivid memories of being taken as a child to watch rehearsals of the Glen Falls Operetta Club, which both her parents were involved in. ""They both had a lot of artistic and intellectual impulses in their lives. But in the end they just became classic middle-class parents, you know - you've gotta get a job, you've gotta work."" For a while, Moore took dance classes. Some of her characters are dancers and, since she doesn't think of herself as a ""natural writer"", I wonder if she considers dance the freer art form. ""I did ballet and it didn't feel free. Absolutely fascistic. I could sometimes get into the groove of it and feel transported. But mostly I remember cramps in my legs and the discipline, and I was not good at that. To me, writing is much freer than dancing. With writing, you could do it whenever you wanted. You didn't have to do little exercises and stay in shape. You could have great moments of inspiration that advanced the story. In dance, unless you're going to choreograph things yourself, you're at the service of someone else."" In lieu of discipline, Moore has obsessiveness, which is not the same thing. ""I was obsessive with writing, but I wasn't ever disciplined. Because if you're obsessive you don't need discipline. You just do it all the time. Why would you impose a regimen, when this is your love?"" The story that caused a brief to-do in her hometown is ""People Like That Are the Only People Here"". In it a baby is diagnosed with cancer and undergoes an operation, and it was widely interpreted as an account of what happened in her own family. She has a son, now aged 13, and he was very ill as a baby, but as she is tired of pointing out, it traduces her skill as a writer to interpret it as any less fictional than all the other things about which she writes. The story is told with no names; only Mother, Father and Baby. The mother is a writer and stands smoking on the hospital balcony, so traumatised by what is happening that part of her wants to get on a bus and be driven away. The father suggests that she write about it, and she says: ""I'm not that good. I can't do this. I can do - what can I do? I can do quasi-amusing phone dialogue. I can do succinct descriptions of weather . . . I do the careful ironies of daydream. I do the marshy ideas on which intimate life is built."" After the story came out, it was assumed by some at her local hospital that references made in it to procedural mistakes were aimed at them. Moore sighs. ""They felt that I was hard on the medical students, and hard on the doctors. The nurses were pleased and the patient-advocacy people were pleased and, frankly, I got a lot of invitations from other medical centres to come and speak. But the local place was much more conflicted. Is that about us? I make this throwaway remark about doctors at home sleeping in their mission-style beds, and one of the doctors said to my husband: tell your wife I had a mission bed before they were fashionable."" She widens her eyes. ""I don't know anything about anybody's bed."" She also had letters from parents with sick children who wrote to say thank you. To her amazement, Moore's son is growing up to be a sports fanatic and is so good at football that he's on the Olympic development team and is flown around the country for matches and training. ""It's very exciting, and very worrisome for a mother. His health is kind of delicate and at the same time he's a jock. It's the worst of both worlds. So he'll fall, he'll collapse sometimes."" He nags his mother to take more exercise. ""He wants to be my personal trainer and all the dance lessons of my childhood come flooding back."" Is her husband a writer? ""I'm divorced. My husband is actually an asshole. He actually does it for a living. It's amazing that people can get paid for that, but he can."" Reading Moore's stories, you wonder how anyone going out with her could avoid getting paranoid. All those unravelling relationships, demented ex-partners, people secretly hating the person lying next to them. And the mockery: ""He had never been involved with the mentally ill before, but now more than ever he was convinced that there should be strong international laws against their being too physically attractive."" The lines are so slick they occasionally undermine their own impact just through the hypnotic roll of the structure, one beautifully delivered unit after another. Moore says that her ex-husband, who she was with for 14 years, wasn't that fussed. ""That was one of the positive things about him. It was easy to be a writer around him. Like, right now, I'm seeing somebody else and that's not easy, because he's scouring the work for signs of him. But my husband never really did that. It's good to have someone who is mildly interested and mildly proud, and also slightly uninterested. When I was in graduate school, I had a teacher who said to me, women writers should marry somebody who thinks writing is cute."" She smiles. ""Because if they really realised what writing was, they would run a mile."" Moore's success in winning a short-story competition when she was 19 surprised her parents as much as it did her. The story was published in Seventeen magazine, and there was a $500 prize that she spent on books and a new stereo; this validation softened her parents' attitude towards her desire to become a writer. It even encouraged them to revisit their own ambitions. Not long after her daughter won the prize, Moore's mother sent something off to a magazine that ""was really good"", says Moore, but was rejected. She was completely discouraged, which is why Moore tells her students to hold off submitting anything until they can take the rejection. Her winning story was unusual in that apart from the setting - a school - it was not about anything of which she had any experience. It was about a teacher, and a janitor who had a crush on her, and switched between their two perspectives. ""Often, and this is not a bad thing, fiction writers use fiction to explore something they know nothing whatsoever about. So I wasn't interested in the lives of 19-year-olds when I was 19. I was interested in grown-ups."" On winning she thought: ""Oh, I'm a professional writer now."" Moore didn't include it in The Collected Stories. She found the experience of going back over old work a bit hair-raising. Her first collection was largely made up of stories she wrote during her master's degree at Cornell. ""There are certain lines and paragraphs and certain things you wrote that you're sort of proud of. But then you look at the next one and it's terrible. It's like I couldn't tell the difference."" Still, she shrugs, ""it's supposed to be like that. The early stuff is . . . supposed to sound early."" These days, she spots mistakes in other people's work. Teaching creative writing interferes with her own work only to the extent that it uses up her time and energy; otherwise, it's helpful to figure out why things don't work. ""I'm very lucky in that I teach advanced students who are talented and eager and nice."" She is about to deliver her third novel, and I wonder what she thinks of criticisms from the chair of this year's Orange prize judges, who said that not enough women novelists were writing on political themes. ""I think women do write politically all the time. Margaret Atwood does, Doris Lessing does. And then there's the whole argument of 'the personal is political' and the way the political world and soldiers and men and global conflict actually does come into the kitchen. It does. I think women are including that and registering that."" And in any case, she says, you can't win. ""Here's one of our most domestic novelists, John Updike, who, in order to stretch himself, writes a novel called Terrorist. It was a really impressive project: it was admirable and convincing and engaging. But he took some grief for it: what's this domestic novelist doing venturing into this? There's no winning."" She admires Anne Enright, and there's something in Enright's humour and lack of pretension that Moore shares. But Moore thinks Enright goes overboard sometimes. Of The Gathering, she says: ""I loved the writing. The writing is really impressive. There's a kind of . . . you get caught for too long in somebody else's crazy family. There's a kind of airlessness and it leaves you gasping for breath. Beautiful writing, but you're immersed - she has this theme of the mistake, of the spiritual error of the Irish family. This damaging, horrifying place."" Moore's own way into the horrifying place is through the small emotions - petulance, unease, awkwardness - around which the larger ones gather. Or not. The brilliance of her humour is that it doesn't require a punchline or anything more lurid than someone waving across a room or fiddling with their hair for its impact. I wonder if she ever wishes she could be less observant. ""In my personal life, I've tried to do that. But in regular life I would want more of that."" She looks around the restaurant. At the next table a man and a woman lean sloppily into each other and look as if they are about to have sex on the tablecloth. ""Like, although I can sort of see, I would love to really know what's going on over there."" Moore on Moore How can it be described? How can any of it be described? The trip and the story of the trip are always two different things. The narrator is the one who has stayed home, but then, afterward, presses her mouth upon the traveller's mouth, in order to make the mouth work, to make the mouth say, say, say. One cannot go to a place and speak of it; one cannot both see and say, not really. One can go, and upon returning make a lot of hand motions and indications with the arms. The mouth itself, working at the speed of light, at the eye's instructions, is necessarily struck still; so fast, so much to report, it hangs open and dumb as a gutted bell. All that unsayable life! That's where the narrator comes in. The narrator comes with her kisses and mimicry and tidying up. The narrator comes and makes a slow, fake song of the mouth's eager devastation. In a work of fiction the protagonist's work will often supply the metaphors of a story. I kept/made this protagonist a writer so that I could present at the centre of the story the dilemma of making art from calamity - its difficulties, obstacles, absurdities. By having the main character be a writer, she could think in terms a writer would, and pose her problems in literary terms. And by doing that, the story can both go more deeply into its subject and also fly out from it completely, hovering above. I suppose this paragraph expresses not just a certain kind of muteness out of which one struggles to make art but also the safe and unsafe distances from which one does it. · The collected stories by Lorrie Moore is published by Faber",A life in books: Lorrie Moore,2008-06-06T23:16:00Z,Emma Brockes,review
"So must it be 42 days? Has the government stifled its backbench rebellion, leaving the Lords to rescue British liberties, as they did eight centuries ago at Runnymede? Or can Labour MPs tear the fair maid of conscience from the seductive arms of expediency, and tell Gordon Brown to get lost? Brown and his ministers claim that ""terrorism"" - code for militant Islam - poses an unprecedented threat to western civilisation. Why then do they persist in undermining a pillar of that civilisation, freedom under the law? Why keep giving Osama bin Laden new feathers to put in his turban? The bill installing 42-day detention without charge goes to the Commons next week, with the full weight of government whipping behind it. It is equalled in almost no other free country and backed by almost no one in Britain's judicial or security establishments. Opponents or known sceptics embrace the former lord chancellor, the former attorney general, the security minister, the director of public prosecution, numerous police chiefs including London's and, so it is said, the leadership of MI5. In an unguarded moment, the whips even murmured that Brown regards it as an inconvenience ""inherited from Tony Blair"". The only support has come from an eccentric Liberal Democrat peer, Lord Carlile, and the former Scotland Yard counter-terrorism chief, Peter Clarke. The latter's defence of the bill in yesterday's Daily Telegraph amounted to little more than a belief that 42 days would be useful to his colleagues, and a complaint that it had all become politicised. Hostility to the bill has forced Downing Street into precisely the bind that a ""listening"" government hates. What began as a police try-on of weak Labour home secretaries has turned into ""a principled stand in defence of national security"". This has then mutated into a talisman of the prime minister's steadiness under fire.  Brown and his staff have been debating clear choices on the bill in recent weeks. Do they hold fast and fight to the death? Do they cut and run with good grace? Or do they twist, slice, spin, threaten and bribe? The predicamentis hardly new. If the Downing Street walls could sing, they could do this one in harmony. Dissidents have even been asked to propose safeguarding amendments, which have been written for them. The mooted changes have turned the detention parts of the bill into a dog's breakfast, akin to other emergency powers and civil contingency laws. Brown and his home secretary, Jacqui Smith, have been reduced to declaring the bill truly and exceptionally unusual, whatever that means, and declaring that 42 days are just right, as they previously said of 14, 28 and 90 days. Such legislation is either so permeated with executive sleight of hand as to be outrageous, or so emaciated by judicial and parliamentary oversight as to be unusable.  The result has blighted what should be a clear and simple emergency measure. Detention beyond 28 days is to be allowed ""only where there is a specific terrorist incident or threat"", but in that case there would surely be enough evidence to lay some charge - at least a holding charge - which is all the police need to extend detention anyway.  As it is, a judge will have to approve the extension - on the basis of some evidence or other - and his decision will have to be approved by parliament within (we are now told) a week. Smith explained yesterday that this meant her asking the Commons to ""test the circumstances of the threat"" in each case against the law. How can this be if MPs cannot be given any material that would prejudice a future trial? Yet if MPs refuse to approve the extension order, Smith says that ""the existing 28-day limit would stand"", which presumably means the suspect being instantly released. This is worse than executive and political pollution of the judicial process; it is unimaginable in practice. Unimaginable legislation is bad legislation. The one case constantly cited (not least by Brown and Clarke) is the Dhiren Barot terrorist plot of 2004. To get a charge together within the then limit of 14 days, said Clarke, ""police officers spent a fortnight sleeping on their office floor ... in a race against time"". They had to handle ""270 computers, 2,000 disks and more than 8,000 other exhibits"".  Yet they succeeded. Charges were laid despite there being ""not a shred of evidence"" other than what Clarke obscurely called ""clear intelligence"". If the police could produce a charge against Barot in 14 days, and now have 28, to claim that they need yet another 14 strains all credibility. It looks suspiciously like a grab for arbitrary power.  Detention without charge cannot be regarded as simply a matter of police convenience in a good cause. An increasing number of cases are coming to appeal of people wrongly arrested and held in Belmarsh for months or years on such flimsy evidence as CIA say-so (as with an innocent Algerian airline pilot in 2001) or the presence on a computer of ""terrorist"" material (as with Yassin Nassari in 2007). The same sort of evidence resulted in the Pakistani president's advance entourage being held for 24 hours in January on suspicion of plotting terrorism. When Clarke says the ""checks and balances in our system prevent arbitrary detention"" he is talking rubbish. The new bill greatly extends the concept of a criminal offence into the realm of free speech and dissemination, and thus heightens the risk of casual imprisonment. When reading Mein Kampf or wearing an alarmist T-shirt becomes a crime, social tolerance has given way to state supremacy - and taken another chip off civilisation.  If British liberties are to be curbed in the secrecy of a home secretary's office, investigators should indeed spend long nights sleeping under their desks. Clarke admitted that he could not think of any ""terrorists"" who have been let go for want of 42 days, yet he demands more police power anyway, rather than seek it later ""in panic in an emergency"".  The police have enough emergency power already. As for panic, that has nothing to do with national security and everything to do with the position of the prime minister. If Gordon Brown needs to appear macho, he can find thugs to arrest, drink laws to change, taxes to raise and citizens to frighten with late-night calls. He has failed to make a case for detaining people for 42 days without charge. MPs should never pass this sinister bill. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com",Simon Jenkins: The government has failed to make the case for 42 days,2008-06-03T23:01:00Z,Simon Jenkins,politics
"Tonight Gordon Brown is set to address the huddled masses of the parliamentary Labour party, whose hearts may not exactly be lifted by the setting out of his 42-day detention plan. Still, the PM has at least one source of comfort: though speculation about a leadership challenge reached a frenzied peak a week ago, the chatter has died down. For the moment, even Labour's young bucks are happy to hold back. If they seem to be sitting on their hands, part of the explanation is inevitably tactical: better to avoid beginning one's career at the top with a historic thumping by the Tories, and take over once Brown has been defeated. But there's surely another reason for their apparent inaction. Schooled in a politics that's fraying fast, they must know that it's time for a fundamental rethink. Much of Brown's predicament may be down to matters of character - but his position is surely also traceable to his clumsy return to a Blairite approach that he and his allies once privately opposed. Certainly, in the stack of coverage of the Crewe byelection, one quote from a Labour source stuck out like a sore thumb: ""The most wounding criticism from Crewe was people saying: 'We thought he was different from Blair, and he's exactly the same.'"" What might have seemed the right Labour path for the 1990s is increasingly looking like the wrong course for the early 21st century. In the wake of the credit crunch, New Labour's obeisance to the free market is looking very rusty indeed. The Economist was ahead of it on the nationalisation of Northern Rock. Mervyn King sits to its left on city bonuses. Even that supposed Blair-lover Nicolas Sarkozy is gearing up to use the forthcoming French presidency of the EU to push for Europe-wide curbs on executive pay. Meanwhile, the old axiomatic belief that the ""aspirational"" mores of English marginals usually had to reduce Labour's social democratic side to acts of stealth now seems misplaced, to say the least: the outcry about the abolition of the 10p tax band proved that concern about the poor ran far wider than New Labour had always assumed, and such issues as debt and the housing shortage surely mean as much in the south-east as they do in the party's heartlands. And so the shibboleths pile up. In keeping with another New Labour article of faith, ministers still cling to the idea that short-term problems can be dealt with via bursts of cynical populism, but such tactics are now making Labour look desperate. To cap it all, David Cameron's quest to be the heir to Blair is fusing with Labour's failure to reinvent itself, and presenting the electorate with a simple enough choice. Which set of post-Thatcherite centrists do you want: the Tiggerish, confident lot who seem that bit more attuned to Britain's social problems, or the ones who look knackered and nasty? By way of trying to put jump leads on their politics, there's a low hubbub of argument from those desperate to keep the New Labour credo alive, but it sounds tired indeed. Last week, the dependably frazzled ex-minister Denis MacShane used the Daily Telegraph to advise Labour to reinvent itself as a party of tax-cutters and spending-scythers, pledged to declare war on ""Whitehall and town-hall bureaucrats"" - a very clever suggestion that would spell the effective end of meaningful party politics. The next day came an altogether more worrying story, sourced from the heart of government rather than the Blairite lunatic fringe: having already told his party to stop worrying about salary levels at the top and ""celebrate the fact that people can be enormously successful"", John Hutton, the business secretary, served notice of his fierce hostility to any calls for new employment regulation. Given that Harriet Harman won last year's deputy leadership election by affecting to tack leftwards, and 92% of Labour donations are now coming from the unions, this kind of heresy will no longer fly. So what is a young would-be leader to do? Have a look at James Purnell, the ambitious work and pensions secretary - once a seemingly robotic young Blairite, but these days given to the odd displays of political vim. In the wake of Labour's drubbing in the local and London elections, he gave a pep talk to the Fabian Society largely focused on child poverty - hobbled, unfortunately, by his refusal to take his arguments to their logical conclusion. As with so many of his colleagues, his problem boils down to this: what kind of conversation about inequality rules out any talk about the people at the top, or the arrangements that keep them there and thus choke the ""meritocracy"" at which he and his allies aim? If you want a sense of New Labour trying to think and theorise its way back into relevance, go to this month's Prospect magazine, and a piece co-written by the economist Richard Reeves and the unfortunately named Phil Collins, a one-time Blair speechwriter now providing his services to Purnell. To be fair, some of what they set out is worth taking seriously: curing the government of its ""tin ear"" on civil liberties; re-embracing the dropped idea of personal carbon allowances and trading; taxing inheritances and house values ""more heavily than at present"". But their argument collapses around its key contentions - that for New Labour to survive, it has to stop ""drawing from the deep, poisoned well of its Fabian tradition"", and go back to Lloyd George and turn ""new liberal"", adjusting to the startling fact that ""the key dividing line in politics is no longer between left and right, but increasingly between liberal and authoritarian"". This may be the kind of stuff that appeals to the New Labour love of swashbuckling iconoclasm, but it's little short of rot. If every jump in the Conservatives' poll ratings seems to revive their Thatcherite aspect, how is it time to leave left-right politics behind and, as they put it, ape Cameron's critique of ""the post-bureaucratic age""? Is now really the best moment to be praising the liberal tradition for ""instinctively disliking income tax""? And what about an apparent suggestion that Labour can crawl out of its predicament by advocating health vouchers? To paraphrase Aneurin Bevan, if social democracy is the language of priorities, what help is any of this? As with just about all the attempts to revive the New Labour brand, it bumps up not just against changing times, but a response to them that now defines Labour's biggest internal tension. To spout the old mantras about equality of opportunity without reference to equality of outcome looks like yesterday's trick. Moreover, as part of a journey in the right direction, hadn't we better call time on the unfettered market, and the insecurity and anxiety it sows? Around those two axes swirl just about every issue that currently defines the political weather - from rising energy and food prices, through the labour-market defects that inflame anxieties about immigration, and on to the breakdown in social bonds symbolised by the current panic about knife crime. Herein, moreover, lie the faint outlines of a strategy (though one wouldn't hold out great hope) whereby Cameron's Tories might just be portrayed as throwbacks to an era that's coming to a close. So far, what remains of the New Labour project has no convincing position on any of this. Its figureheads sit in tortured silence, desperately trying to convincingly speak a language forged in the past, while the world speeds somewhere else entirely. john.harris@theguardian.com","John Harris: Instead of reviving New Labour, the party must now drop this Blairite rot",2008-06-01T23:01:00Z,John Harris,politics
"The start and finish of Martin Amis's sold-out session at Hay arguably said it all. To begin, he read from a chapter of his recently-published collection The Second Plane, in which he follows Tony Blair around a handful of continents: a portrait of high-level diplomacy in which Amis's inevitably elegant language cannot disguise his lack of political insight. At the end, the Guardian's Sarfraz Manzoor coolly asked him if he actually knew any Muslims, and drew the best part of a blank: ""Where would I come across them?"" he asked, before admitting that though he knows no ""devout"" followers of Islam, he counts Salman Rushdie and Ed Husain among his friends, and has slept with women from Iran and Pakistan. Amis, it seems, has a problem. The events of September 11, he said, gave him the feeling that just about everything he'd written in the past now looked like ""self-indulgent rubbish"", and so he began frantically trying to deal with what had happened through his writing. The book proves that at first, he did not quite find his gear (the people of Afghanistan, he wrote in 2001, ""should not be bombarded with cruise missiles; they should be bombarded with consignments of food, firmly marked LENDLEASE USA""), though he eventually settled on the terrified, apocalyptic, Manichean approach to geopolitics that is now his calling card, and remained busy. Ergo his coining of the term ""horrorism"", his fascinated enquiries into the theology of suicide bombing, and the notorious interview in the Times in which he admitted to very nasty thoughts about Muslims and collective punishment. On top of that, he soaked up the belief of his good friend Christopher Hitchens that the time had come to berate large swathes of the European left for their supposed sympathies with an enemy on a par with fascism, a riff he returned to today, rehashing the passage from the book in which he claims that ""given the choice between George Bush and Osama bin Laden, the liberal relativist, it seems, is obliged to plump for the Saudi"". This, to repeat the point for 365th time, is straw man sophistry of the most risible kind: if there are parts of the ultra-ultra left who'd cleave to that view, they ain't liberal relativists. To be fair, Amis's prevailing critique is developing, in its own way. Today, he admiringly quoted from such sources as diverse as John Gray and Robert Fisk. Whereas some of his compadres in the belligerati would have you believe that jihadism was, is and will always be sui generis, he made the not-exactly-revelatory point (in very vague terms) that something within the Arab psyche was profoundly shaken by the Israeli military victories of 1948 and 1967. And he remains of the opinion that 1) the invasion of Iraq was a terrible blunder, and 2) by way of muddying the West's moral waters, the election of George Bush (""a dry drunk from West Texas"") at the outset of the 21st century represented one of history's more unfortunate coincidences. These, you may have noticed, are hardly penetrating lines of argument. Worse still, Amis's ideas about the West's response to Islamist terrorism are shot through with the most howling of contradictions: he bemoans the ""infantilisation"" of intellectual discourse and the ramping-up of rhetoric for the fact that it's impossible to talk about any number of subjects in calm, level-headed terms, and then claims that millions of Europeans are ""thirsty for a bloody fiasco in Iraq"" - and are effectively pro-al Qaeda. Infantilised? Ramped-up? Hello? This piece could stretch into the distance, but I'll be brief. At one point, Amis claimed ""the USA has never been an imperially-minded country"". At another, he made the political naif's current mistake du jour by talking about Barack Obama winning the US presidency as if it was a given (a line currently bouncing around bourgeois dining rooms like nobody's business). He then wildly speculated about how the Islamic aspects of Obama's family background might make him the subject of a fatwa, and render dealings with the Saudis difficult - a point which points up the fact that his hyped-up, almost romantic view of things rather understimates the imperatives of pragmatic realpolitik. By the end, for all his ornate verbal flourishes and occasional flashes of insight, he was starting to look slightly embarrassing. This newspaper's review of The Second Plane concluded that it ""added nothing to his reputation."" Quite so - and on this evidence, his detour into political commentary is now detracting from it. Far be it from me, but one can surely adapt Denis Healey's advice to people in holes, and advise him to get back to fiction-writing, and quick - but first, to stop digging.

"Political chatter has only one theme at the moment: Labour's woes and the life expectancy of its besieged leader. The premise of all this talk is the assumption that Labour will lose the next general election. Sorry to state the obvious, but if Labour is on course for a sound defeat, doesn't that mean the Tories are on their way to victory? In which case, while it's certainly more fun guessing the runners and riders to take over from Gordon, isn't it time we took a hard look at the party which seems set to rule this country in just two years' time?  Admittedly, it's a knack the commentariat, like the Labour front bench, has lost. The Tories were so useless for so long, scrutiny of Conservative ideas in the Hague-IDS-Howard era came to seem like a futile exercise, covering Tory speeches a job for the sketchwriters only.  That won't do now. The Labour party of Neil Kinnock was submitted to microscopic examination in the lead-up to the 1992 election. Indeed, the genius of the Conservative campaign in that year was to make the election a referendum on the opposition, rather than the government, a decision in which Labour was found wanting. At present, those still loyal to Brown insist that 2010 will be different from the local polls and last week's Crewe byelection because it will not be a plebiscite on Labour but a choice between the two parties. But fashioning the contest that way won't happen all by itself. It will require training the klieg lights on the Conservatives - starting right now.  There is plenty to be exposed. Last September, most Tories quaked at the prospect of an early election, knowing that the facade constructed by David Cameron concealed either a blank space or a tangle of contradictions. Despite the turnaround in their fortunes, those tensions and empty holes remain. Take the area where, along with greenery, Cameron has built his credentials as a new kind of compassionate Conservative: his concern for our ""broken society"". With IDS's report on ""Breakdown Britain"" in his back pocket, Cameron encourages voters to believe that the country is cracking up - descending into a netherworld of split families, feral youths and rising crime - and it needs the Tories to put it back together again.  Yet what are the tools available to a Westminster politician anxious to do such work? There are hundreds, but what they have in common is that they're in the toolbox marked central government. The trouble for Cameron is that he has disavowed these means, thanks to a philosophy that still sees the state as problem rather than solution.  Thus in a pitch for centre-left voters in the Independent earlier this month, the Tory leader proclaimed his determination to make Britain more family friendly: ""That includes paying couples to live together rather than apart, and more help for parents in the crucial early years, through reforms such as a massively expanded health visitor service and flexible parental leave.""  Putting aside the fact that Cameron wants to take Britain out of the European social chapter, which guarantees some of the employment protections essential for family life, how would he achieve these admirable goals? ""In all these areas,"" he wrote, ""instead of using the old-fashioned mechanisms of top-down state control, we will use the modern mechanisms of civil society - whether it's businesses ... social enterprises ... or charities and community groups.""  Sounds lovely, but how does he expect charities to provide a ""massively expanded health visitor service""? Which businesses, exactly, are going to pay for that couples' bonus? Has Cameron found the social enterprises who will take care of ""early years"" help for all Britain's children?  Reliance on the public realm rather than the public sector, as Cameron puts it, sounds very appealing. But it assumes a capacity that Britain's civil society, for a variety of reasons, does not have. This is not America, with its vast army of church-based volunteers. Expecting the voluntary sector to mend Britain's ""broken society"" while disavowing a central role for government is to make a promise that cannot be kept.  It suggests the Tories mean well enough but that they have not quite thought things through. As one Labourite puts it: ""The Tories used to be the stupid party, then they became the nasty party, now they're back to being the stupid party again."" If Labour is looking for an attack line, this could be it: the new Conservatives - nice, but dim.  This would reframe the way Labour takes on the Tories: not denying that they've changed under Cameron, but insisting they cannot make good on their newfound concern for the vulnerable. ""If you will the ends, you must will the means,"" says one cabinet minister. Mere exhortation to do good is not enough. There is other gold to be mined here. In February, Oliver Letwin, senior brain to the Cameroons, let slip a highly revealing remark: ""Many things that are done by the government or the private sector could be done more effectively, or more cheaply, by the third sector."" That reference to ""more cheaply"" suggests that what Cameron dresses up as a progressive project, unleashing civil society, is in fact a warmed-up version of an old Thatcherite goal - doing government's job on the cheap.  If so, the Tories are making a major mistake. For ""shrinking the state"" turns out to be rather expensive, at least initially. The Conservatives propose, for example, allowing new organisations to come in and run state schools. Those new providers will turn to the government for capital funds to build these new schools: a big spending surge, right at the start. Same goes for ""choice"" in the public services: for choice to be meaningful there has to be spare capacity, whether empty school desks or unfilled hospital beds. Those cost money too.  Cameron says: ""If you care about poverty, if you care about inequality, you should forget Labour and back the Tories."" After the 10p debacle, and its hammering of those on low incomes, that sounds like a fair claim. But who seriously believes the Conservatives would match the £1.7bn to fight child poverty promised by Alistair Darling in his first budget, even in a time of economic squeeze? The signs are not encouraging. The Conservatives are hinting that they would switch focus away from the poor who earn 60% of the national median income to the ""extremely poor"", who earn just 40% of the median. As if by magic, 2.5 million children would no longer count as poor. As James Purnell put it: ""The Tories don't want to eradicate poverty, they want to redefine it."" Everybody knows the credibility problems Labour has making this and every other case. Labour has not done enough on poverty or inequality. And it's hard to hound the Tories for making £10bn of wild, uncosted tax pledges, and for issuing unfunded spending plans, when the chancellor this month magicked £2.7bn out of the air to clear up the 10p mess.  Still, Labour needs voters to start asking the Tories tough questions. Unless the electorate is simply not in the mood. ""Scrutiny is a symptom of doubt,"" says one shrewd Tory strategist. Voters had doubts about Neil Kinnock, so examined him closely; Tony Blair endured no such treatment. Labour's great fear must be that Cameron has already passed the electability test, that the nation can imagine him as PM in a way it never could with Kinnock. If that is the case, then the only harsh interrogation will be the one voters are engaged in right now - with all their fire directed at Labour.  freedland@theguardian.com",Jonathan Freedland: Labour needs voters to start asking tough questions of the Tories too,2008-05-27T23:01:00Z,Jonathan Freedland,politics
"Rushdie, Hitchens, Vidal and Carter may have drawn the crowds, but think I found Hay's bellwether event in a half-full tent at 10 o'clock this morning. Billed as a discussion about ""the nature of power and influence in Britain"", it found the BBC's Robert Peston and the Daily Mail's Peter Oborne laying varying degrees of waste to Britain's political and financial oligarchs, and an audience lapping up just about every word. One question popped into my mind time and again: if this is the agenda of people resident in the media mainstream, and they're being endlessly cheered, what does it mean for our politics? Oborne is the author of The Triumph Of The Political Class, a romping critique of the alleged dereliction of British democracy that has attracted garlands and arrows in roughly equal measure. By dint of Peston's presence, Oborne presaged his attack on Westminster with a broadside fired at the City - full, he assured us, of ""not particularly clever people"", who live in a ""horrible, secluded world"" and do ""enormous damage to this country"". From there, it was a short hop to his crescendo: a passage focused on ""a narrow political elite, acting in conjunction with these ghastly creatures to destroy much of what's unique about our terrific and marvellous country"". The clapometer went into the red. Peston's contribution was much less showy, more straitlaced, and arguably that bit more convincing: a 20-minute powerpoint presentation in which he sounded a notably more swingeing tone than in his book, Who Runs Britain. Out it all came: the omnipotence of private equity and hedge funds, the ongoing brouhaha about gargantuan bonuses, and the fact that governments - and New Labour in particular - are so frit. ""I'm losing my lifelong faith in global financial capitalism,"" he said. At times, Peston sounded almost surprised at the ferocity of his own critique. So, in some part, did the audience. Devoid of Oborne's showmanship and broad sweeps, it was that little bit more convincing - not least because Peston's take on the gratuitous excesses of the financial sector is predominantly based around inefficiency and waste rather than ethics. The point was made by one slide that featured Albert Einstein and the words, ""Do we want our braniacs to become hedge-fund managers?"" But let's not get too carried away. To get to the instructive stuff, plenty of things need to be factored out of both their arguments: Oborne's rose-tinted, High Tory view of an old idyll in which selfless civil servants looked after us all and noblesse oblige was Britain's saving grace; Peston's emphasis on such dreamy panaceas as harmonised international tax rates. What was telling, though, was that so much of what they said came with an anti-ruling elite (oh, go on then - ruling class) sound and fury that one would usually associate with the ultra-left. And just to recap: this event featured a bloke from the Mail and another from the BBC, and a cagoule-clad audience drawn squarely from the liberal bourgeousie. Oh, and it was hosted in a huge marquee partly funded by the wealth-management wing of Barclays Bank. Really: what strange times these are.

"It isn't true that everything is getting more expensive. A year ago, eBay customers were bidding £200 for an Anya Hindmarch 'I'm Not a Plastic Bag' eco-bag, with 'We Are What We Do' written on the inside, even though they knew it had just cost the eco-seller £5 from Sainsbury's. Today, that exact same 'I'm Not a Plastic Bag' bag brand new(ish), with tags, may be had for around half that or less, although inevitably there are rumours that some of these cheaper 'I'm Not a Plastic Bag' bags are in fact cynical, if hard-to-spot, copies, good for absolutely nothing but carrying groceries home in. But consumer fear of being sold a fake (tip: watch out for zips and deformed apostrophes) cannot explain entirely the plummeting value of this once-sacred tote. The credit crunch is already known to have had an impact on bag fever. And one which is likely to be exaggerated when the bag in question is, like the INAPB, so plainly last year's model. (Of many new and attractive fair trade options, one is made, according to the Ethical Superstore, 'by a co-operative in Bangkok from 100 per cent recycled grain sacks'.) But Anya prices might also have suffered from widespread consumer disillusion. Some ethical shoppers are minded, apparently, to return bags which have conspicuously failed, even after a whole year of regular use, to save the world. When the INAPB was introduced by an organisation called We Are What We Do, many bag devotees clearly believed that it might not be beyond a truly special tote to succeed - where Al Gore, James Lovelock and the Smythson's Nancy Bag have so far struggled - in accomplishing 'small changes and big differences'. One scholar, from think-tank Ekklesia, drew a parallel between this practical bag-engagement and Diognetus's doctrine of praxis. Hymning the bag after it appeared on the arm of Keira Knightley, the Sun newspaper told readers: 'Being green has never been more cool.' It would be unfair, of course, to blame the bag alone for the notably tepid interest in saving the planet recently expressed in a survey conducted by Opinium Research. Something else must explain why, after years of environmental consciousness-raising, supported by an increasingly unanimous scientific community whose chilling prognostications are now regularly proclaimed by everyone from George Monbiot to Nicholas Stern, 72 per cent of the population said they did not want to pay any green taxes. Almost as many thought the green agenda has been hijacked by the government as a dodge for raising taxes. On the other hand, researchers found the public is not suffering from a comprehensive ethical breakdown. The great majority of consumers, some 94 per cent, revealed some awareness of what Lovelock has called 'the ineluctable consequences of destruction', and therefore 'aim to behave in an environmentally friendly manner themselves'. An understandable approach when you think how many times politicians, eager to delegate an unpopular task, have reminded the public that with climate change, every little really and truly helps.  'Each of us can make a difference,' Gordon Brown likes to drone, without ever saying what he has in mind. Should we be hanging 4x4 drivers from their own bull bars? Or taking cold showers, maybe once a week, just to show China we mean business?  No one would deny, however, that the personal, praxis-based approach to tackling climate change has made a difference. Without it, there would be, for instance, no fair trade fashion, no eco-jewellery made by peasant collectives, none of the magazines and websites where concerned consumers can find out how to save the planet in ways that won't involve politics or membership of some austere group such as Friends of the Earth with its Big Ask.  Why not start, instead, with a really weeny ask, then work up? Something like Ethical Living magazine's poser of the month: 'Is your sex appeal sustainable?' No? Then invest in some new 'ethical undies'. Though there are many cheaper expressions of virtue. Pesticide-free tampons, for instance. Every little helps. Even when that little would be, outside this strictly ethical context, an exercise in supremely fatuous self-regard.  A website called Do the Green Thing applauds the most microscopic acts of altruism. Such as walking ('whenever possible'). Its latest proposal is 'Stick With What You've Got'. 'Buying too much stuff puts an insane strain on the environment.' That sticking with what you've got and, indeed, with where you are should be so much less challenging during an economic slowdown has led some greens to welcome the prospect of recession, since a collapse in growth would inevitably slow energy consumption. This turns out to be a dream shared by that nice Michael O'Leary from Ryanair. 'In many ways, we would welcome a chill or something even colder,' he said recently. 'We would welcome a good, deep, bloody recession in this country for 12 to 18 months. It would help see off the environmental nonsense that has become so popular among the chattering classes.'  A somewhat graceless comment, perhaps, given the broadmindedness that has allowed these same chattering classes to continue to use O'Leary's airline for their European mini-breaks, no matter what the cost to their most cherished principles. This liberal attitude may also explain why holiday companies can still boast of being, possibly unlike ethical living, recession-proof. We are what we do. The piercing wisdom of the Anya Hindmarch bag in relation, at least, to middle-class green consumers is confirmed yet again by new figures showing a decline in sales of organic food and, outside the home, by a general apathy in the face of Heathrow's third runway and the exclusion of airline emissions from the watery I'm Not a Climate Change Bill. Events in Crewe and Nantwich illustrate the difficulties of politicians intent on doing anything, such as carbon-taxing to avert catastrophe since a) no one really believes it's coming, b) they'll be dead anyway, c) the recession has left them much too fearful and poor to care, and d) they won't vote for anyone who tries to make them. So Brown won't make himself more unpopular by reducing airline emissions or introducing personal carbon allowances. Neither he nor Cameron nor Clegg will, to their collective shame, unite behind an effective carbon policy which, appearing identically in every manifesto like the nasty nougat in every box of chocolates, may put the interests of future generations before contemporary self-pity. And when Cameron, versatile friend of both glacier and motorist, finally prevails, his strategy for 'green growth' has as much chance of holding back the rising seas as did the Anya Hindmarch bag. And fair play to the bag: at least you could carry stuff in it.","Catherine Bennett: Green politics, like all fashions, has proved sadly transient",2008-05-24T23:01:00Z,Catherine Bennett,politics
"For the second time in three weeks, Gordon Brown will this weekend survey a landscape strewn with wreckage. At the start of May, he had to contemplate the debris left by a hammering in local elections, including the loss of the London mayoralty. Those results were disastrous enough, Labour shoved into third place on a measly 24%, a full 20 points behind the Conservatives. But today he has to stare at the rubble of what was a safe Labour seat in Crewe and Nantwich - and, in some ways, the sight is even worse.  Yesterday was one of those dire days most politicians hope to endure only rarely in a career: the prime minister has now had two such days in a month. He had to appear before the cameras, grey-faced, once again on the defensive, fending off reporters' questions about his own future - asking whether, if he concluded that he was the problem, he would, for the sake of his beloved party, step down - insisting again and again that he understood voters' pain over high prices and vowing that he would steer the nation, like a storm-spattered sea captain, through the current turbulence. Meanwhile, he would doubtless have seen David Cameron on some TV monitor, standing on the street in Crewe and Nantwich, glowing with success, cracking jokes, bathing in the applause of local volunteers celebrating their first byelection victory over Labour in 30 years.  That fact is uncomfortable, because that last Tory win, in Ilford North, came in 1978, a warning that the Callaghan government's time was running out and the Thatcher era was coming. And yesterday it was inescapable: barring a turnaround on a miraculous scale, Brown seems set to suffer Callaghan's fate - to be the unmandated prime minister, the successor to a serial election winner who serves out the closing days of Labour before a crushing defeat.  Cameron played his part, too. The youth, the buoyancy, the momentum visible in the footage from Cheshire yesterday recalled Tony Blair circa 1995 - an opposition leader who knows he is on his way to power. The stats were numbing. The swing to the Tories was a massive 17.6%: a landslide if repeated in a general election. It happened in a northern Labour heartland, burying forever the one-time Labour hope that Cameron could not appeal beyond his southern comfort zone. More significantly, the Tories polled well not only in more affluent Nantwich but also in low-income Crewe, suggesting that blue-collar, core Labour voters are now ready to make the direct switch to the Conservatives.  Labour MPs who were nervous already will now be petrified. Marginals were always vulnerable; but Crewe and Nantwich was 165th on the Tories' target list. Those who on Thursday reckoned they held safe Labour seats will be much less confident today.  The talk now, especially in the media, will be of Brown's leadership. Yesterday only the odd maverick MP was ready to call on ministers to challenge the prime minister. It's there in private Labour chatter, but the turning point has not yet been reached. Ministers say Brown has until the party conference, or perhaps next spring's local and European elections, to turn things around. Others are less patient, urging their colleagues to see that ""the house is already on fire"" - and that it's a delusion to think that Brown is somehow going to improve as dramatically as the situation requires. ""The voters are telling us they don't like him, it's as simple as that,"" says one Labourite. If nothing happens immediately, that's partly because the Labour tribe is still shell-shocked at the pounding they are receiving; they had got used to beating the Tories easily and can't quite believe they are on course to defeat. Others say the problem is not just the leader: the party itself has forgotten what it stands for. Besides, there is no obvious alternative. So they wait, in the hope that something will happen. Meanwhile, they can reflect on the campaign just lost. It was xenophobic, taunting the Tories for being soft on ""foreigners"", wholly negative and crude, seeking to brand the Conservative Edward Timpson as a top-hatted toff. That backfired, not least because Labour picked the wrong target. Timpson's family fortune was built from a shoe-repair business - hardly the landed aristocracy - and he had grown up with some 80 foster siblings, taken in by parents determined to do their bit for the vulnerable.  The Conservatives were quick to exploit that error. George Osborne announced: ""There is a new nasty party in British politics and it is the Labour party."" Conservative bloggers took great heart in the realisation that ""the electoral sting appears to have been finally drawn from the 'Tory boy' stereotype."" For three elections, Labour could rely on anti-Tory sentiment. Perhaps it is the passage of time, but fear of the Conservatives no longer seems to operate. These days, it seems, it is Labour who the voters want to keep out.",Jonathan Freedland: Just when he thought it couldn't get any worse ...,2008-05-23T23:01:00Z,Jonathan Freedland,politics
"The thinktank Demos this week launched UK Confidential, a collection of essays about privacy. It's beyond huge, this issue - it spans every technological advance that's ever happened, every element of government, every cultural trend: so many things make incursions into our individual privacies that I favour a ""sod it, it's over"" approach - although if there's one thing on which this collection is quite firm, it's that fatalism doesn't help. One of the issues that really detained everyone, in a debate to mark the book's publication, was that of alerting young people to the long-term impact of betraying one's own privacy. Peter Bazalgette, former chief of Endemol (the makers of Big Brother), took David Cameron as his typical noughties politician - Cameron is compromised by his student membership of the Bullingdon Club. There's a photo of him and his pals wearing top hats, and even though this isn't illegal, well, it should be. Nevertheless, men and women of Cameron's age can still staunch the revelations about them; the odd photograph can be discreetly lifted out of circulation; drug questions can be answered with the famous ""I'm allowed to have had a private life before politics in which we make mistakes"" (my favourite part is that segue from ""I"" to ""we"" - it's not exactly a royal ""we"", more like ""I'm afraid I had an evil twin, and he used to make mistakes. But now I've killed him""). Anyway, Bazalgette moved on to what the politicians of 15 years from now will be faced with: from social networking sites, there will not be just one photograph of them but hundreds. If they've ever done a funny dance or taken cocaine, it will appear on YouTube as soon as they attain even modest celebrity. There will be no burying this stuff: we will either have to select our political class from the socially reclusive, or suffer a new Westminster so uninhibited that they simply do not care what their adolescent selves got up to.  How, then, do we teach the young to guard their privacy? How do we attach a sense of value to this abstract commodity that, while they are young, has no value? Pragmatically, you might say, this is straightforward - you tack a module on the citizenship curriculum, and if they post a picture of themselves mooning at a goat on Facebook after that then that's their lookout. The trouble with this is, first, there is something a bit laughable in any reigning generation trying to teach the one below it what the ramifications are of their relationship with technology. Second, adolescents don't expose themselves on social-networking sites by accident. Almost all teenage behaviour is about owning the neutral physical space around you. Why else do they sit and shout at each other on buses? It's important to make a distinction between fashionable things that young people happen to like - Grand Theft Auto IV, for instance - and behaviours they engage in as a function of their youth and vigour. Facebook and MySpace may seem modern because they're on a computer, but they nevertheless fall into the second category. So trying to inculcate discretion at a time when everybody is seeking exposure is like teaching abstinence at a time when all they want to do is have sex. Never mind the rights and wrongs of it, it doesn't work.  The upshot, though, is that 15 years hence, people won't need to be protected from their past excesses, because the very fact that this is a universal impulse that social-networking sites merely cater to, will mean that tomorrow's politicians will all have as many skeletons in their closets as one another. In fact, if you don't have a YouTube video from when you were 16, dancing to Britney Spears's Toxic, then it'll be as much an impediment to your public approval rating as being single is today.  mszoewilliams@yahoo.co.uk",Zoe Williams: Generation excess,2008-05-20T23:03:14Z,Zoe Williams,politics
"Speaking for Myself: The Autobiography  by Cherie Blair  Little, Brown £18.99, pp407 Oh, Cherie! As the journalist from the 2003 'Lippygate' story, I was there when Cherie Blair let in Marie Claire (myself and photographer Jane Hodson), to observe her having her lipstick applied by the 'Juicy Couture Rasputin', Carole Caplin, on the PM's bed. At the time, I found Cherie 'flawed, shrill, a charm-free zone', as well as 'weird and inappropriate' (at one point clutching my arm in the back of a car and roaring show tunes into my face). Most of all, I saw Cherie as 'wrenchingly innocent' when dealing with journalists - the 'ultimate New Labour Icarus free-falling from grace under a suddenly hostile media sun'. Well, free-falling is one thing - five years later, with Speaking for Myself, Cherie Blair/ Booth/ whatever, appears finally to have landed, and with quite a splat. It is difficult to approach Speaking for Myself with an open mind when one is scuppered from the off by an overwhelming feeling of deja vu. Indeed, after the heavy-duty filleting of the newspaper serialisations, the sensation was not so much of reading a book as of scrutinising a literary doily. One hopes for her sake that Cherie got the rumoured lucrative deals as, quite frankly, once they'd finished taking out the 'good bits', there was little of consequence left. Saying that, here it is - all the New Labour gossip, as well as observations on such international figures as George W Bush ('Nice' apparently, but not as 'nice' as his wife), Princess Diana (also 'nice') and Bill Clinton (depicted here ogling Carole Caplin in her yoga leotard). Everything from how Gordon Brown, in his haste to become PM, actually prolonged Blair's tenure (Cherie just about refrains from writing 'Nerrr'), to the truth about the Granita deal (it didn't take place at Granita). Then of course there is Iraq (Tony's crises of conscience) as well as the 'sexed-up dossier' and the suicide of David Kelly, which plunges the PM into despair. Luckily, Cherie is there to whisper supportively into her husband's ear: 'You are a good man. And God knows your motives are pure, even if the consequences are not as you hoped.' This entire conversation, according to Cherie, occurred in Beijing, in front of hundreds of international press. Why don't we believe her? Then of course there is the 'sex stuff', including every detail of Blair child Leo's arrival into the world, bar an actual photograph of the sperm penetrating the ovum (perhaps Cherie is hanging on to that for her next book, 'Shutting up Finally'). There's the now-infamous 'contraceptive equipment', which, bearing in mind Cherie's Catholicism, conjures some kind of tortuous chastity device authorised by Opus Dei. Most chillingly, all that stuff about her and young Tony 'getting to know each other' on the double-decker bus, and 'even better' by the next morning. What is so disturbing is not just that Cherie, a highly intelligent, top-ranking barrister in her fifties, clearly believes that she has achieved classy Old Hollywood-esque, one-foot-on-the-floor subtlety with this coy rubbish, but also that presumably Tony thinks she has too. Let us not forget, Tony Blair vetted this book, and thus approved the references to the 'smell of his skin', 'his strong young body', and 'his hair [curling] down over his collar in a way that made me want to twist it around my fingers'. Any other ex-PM in British history would have wanted to twist his wife by the neck for such cringeworthy outpourings, or at least shout: 'It's supposed to be a political wife's memoir, not an update of Looking for Mr Goodbar.' But not, it seems, Tony. The same applies to Cherie's seeming Tourette's about money. The poor woman just can't help it. It is one thing to blurt out something silly and regret it (all those gaffes Cherie refers to), quite another to write it down, and then keep it in, all the way through the publishing process. Even more so now, with the Blairs' recent purchase of Sir John Gielgud's country mansion, it is completely bemusing, even sickening, to read about Cherie's bratty raging at Brown stopping them having a salary increase, or her 'poor moi' whingeing at having to pay a mortgage 'the size of Mount Snowdon' (for a house of equal size). She even, at one point, refuses to pay her own airfare for a charitable cause, in such a way that she clearly feels completely in the right. All of this makes Cherie look stupid: less Lady Macbeth (hissing 'This is your moment' into Tony's ear); more a social climbing New Labour Hyacinth Bucket. The fact that, throughout the book, Cherie blames her financial anxieties on her penniless Scouse upbringing somehow makes it worse. One understands that she had a feckless actor father (Tony Booth), her mum had to work in a chip shop, and it was tough affording grammar school uniforms and what she needed for her legal career. Nor am I one of those who think such a background has no relevance (imagine the uproar if David Cameron were to claim his privileged background had no bearing on the man he became). What ends up rankling is Cherie's lack of humour and self-awareness about money. Just as unattractive (though admittedly more interesting) is the constant sulky point-scoring (Brown, Campbell, Princess Margaret and Carole Caplin are among those who get belated raspberries). Then there are Cherie's attempts disingenuously to place herself, even during the Peter Foster buy-to-let scandal (a misunderstanding caused by forgotten emails, apparently), in an innocent beleaguered light, despite all the evidence to the contrary. For what it's worth, 'Lippygate' is also different from what I recall. In just one example, Cherie has herself trying desperately to keep us away from Leo; I remember her taking us into the garden to introduce us to him. All of which is only relevant because you then start wondering what else Cherie 'mis-remembers', as her old pal Hillary might say. In the end, this book makes you feel about Cherie as I did the day I met her - confused and turned off. Indeed, for all the fun to be had with the gossipy 'guess what!' tone (all giving credence to the theory that Cherie rushed this out in order to capitalise on Gordon Brown's troubles), ultimately this was an opportunity missed. The truth is, Cherie Blair has had an astonishing journey from Liverpool to Number 10, in her career, her charity work, and her 'marriage of equals with Blair'. A wifely, Pepys-like account might have been very interesting. However, for that Cherie would have needed to consign herself to the sidelines, and, for all her efforts, she never does. What Cherie should realise is that despite all her 'goldfish bowl' whining, she is the only Number 10 spouse to have screwed it all up so badly. Even Denis Thatcher did a better job, and he was supposed to be drunk. Cherie's intoxication is, more dangerously, with herself. In the very last section she has Tony smiling away about her last comment to the press ('I won't miss you lot'), leading to her musing self-adoringly: 'I am the abrasiveness against which he can spark.' Really? Reading Speaking for Myself, some of us are wondering whether he would have been better off with Denis. Cherie picking: sex, Iraq, the Queen On Tony Blair: 'The truth, I began to realise, was that he was a very good-looking young man.' On the Queen: 'Over the years, we had got used to one another. She was clearly very fond of Tony and the last time we went [to Balmoral], I was really sad to think that we would never go there again.' On Alastair Campbell: '""How dare you,"" I said to Alastair, his arms by now folded. ""Don't think I don't know about you writing porn for whatever magazine it was.""' On the Iraq War: 'I always felt strongly that [Tony] should not apologise for something he believed to be right.' On George Bush: 'George is actually a very funny, charming man with a quirky sense of humour. No one can say that he doesn't have a sense of humour.'

"Back in the Nineties, I worked for the new male magazine Loaded, launched by the irrepressible James Brown. A couple of things stand out in the fug of memory. One, I seemed to be the only female in the country the office males didn't look at in a sexual light (insulting, but I'll live). Two, I, along with every other female with a drink in their hand, who wasn't actually dead, was automatically branded a 'ladette'. Was I really a ladette? As far as I could tell, I was just the same loudmouth, obnoxious, slightly pitiful drunk I'd always been. But OK, if forced, and popular culture demanded it, I could deal with supposedly spearheading a whole new way of 'being female'. However, even at the time, most of us felt that the new lad/ladette thing was, at core, a media construct - convenient labels for people and their behaviour, all of which, in truth, had been going on for years, if not decades. Which sprang to mind when I saw last week's doom-laden 'rise of the ladette' reports. My first thought was that, as this had apparently been 'rising' since Zoë Ball was on Radio 1, shouldn't 'ladette culture' be through the ozone layer and out into orbit by now? Less amusingly, figures from the Youth Justice Board reported that while male crime was dropping off slightly, girl crime, meaning acts of criminal damage, public disorder and minor assaults, had risen 25 per cent, most of it due to excessive alcohol consumption. Clearly, with young girls and crime, it was becoming too much a case of the booze talking. Nor were police inclined any more to be protective towards these young females or to turn a blind eye. With this in mind, should women like me, the first official wave of ladettes, if you like, feel 'survivor's guilt'? Well, maybe, maybe not. To me, these kinds of reports are always a little bit suspicious, being strongly reminiscent of the scare stories about girls overtaking boys in exams, as in, no one seemed to care so much when boys were doing the overtaking. In the same way, it is eminently more newsworthy to report that girls (made, as they are, of sugar and spice and all things nice) are getting 25 per cent 'more violent and criminal' than to admit that young men and boys remain five times worse. In reality, neither yoof gender is exactly covering itself in glory at the moment. However, when young males are committing around 250,000 crimes a year, to the females relatively paltry 50,000, I know which sex of hoodie I'll be continuing to cross the road to avoid on a dark night. Even if it's true and the ladette really is on the 'rise', it is arguable that society is just getting what it deserves. In recent years, young girls have been increasingly encouraged to display the supposedly 'male' qualities of assertiveness and ambition (as demonstrated by those Darwinism-gone-mad she-freaks on The Apprentice). Why then does everyone act so aggrieved when the same generation of females displays negative male traits of aggression, boorishness and criminality (as demonstrated by all the contestants on The Apprentice)? This creaky old ladette, crouched sadly in the corner with her pint and her Zimmer, also bridles belatedly at the notion that masculinity is obviously considered so superior, so covetable a state, there is even this term - ladettes - for supposedly aping male behaviour. After all these years, where is the equivalent? Where, pray, are the 'lassettes'? Boys behaving like girls, getting great grades, being non-violent, nurturing, and the rest?  They must be out there, but we'll never hear about them, leastways not until boys behaving well is considered just as 'shocking' and 'newsworthy' as girls behaving badly. Oh, Barack - you can call me sweetie anytime If you haven't already, take a look at the clip of Barack Obama saying to a female reporter: 'Hold on a second, sweetie.' Interesting. We've all been so busy musing on race, we forgot to give Obama a grilling about women. Now just listen to that 'sweetie' - could it be that beneath that beautiful skin beats the heart of a casual sexist?  Obama apologised later, but it was too late; some of us already had an image of him going home, patting his wife's behind and growling: 'Where's my dinner, woman?' Which has to be a good thing, especially in the US - it makes him look a bit of a jock instead of some bloodless liberal. Not to mention an even bigger hit with the ladies.  Back in Britain, we're still a bit backward with our sexism-reporters directing it at sexy politicians as opposed to politicians directing it at hacks (boo). Which is why we saw reams last week on 'political totty' Caroline 'Catwalk' Flint, seemingly so dubbed because, one, she is attractive and two, she wears fresh clothes to work every day. Yeah, talk about asking for it.  One also notes a resurgence of media carping about the relative sexiness of Italian and French MPs. Why, people moan, can't we have ministerial 'hotties', steaming up the corridors of power? For Christ's sake, what do you think James Purnell is for? The poor guy is wriggling as fast as he can.  May I also remind you that, once, Edwina Curry was renowned for playing the political totty card and it is not only Norma Major who would prefer not to see a return of those dark days? Time to accept that while Obama might be able to get away with being sexy and sexist, over here, we have long ago learnt our lesson.  So some people despise Amy? Well, there's a surprise A survey in Marketing magazine reveals that while the five 'most loved' celebrities are men (Paul McCartney, Lewis Hamilton, Gary Lineker, Simon Cowell, David Beckham), the four 'most hated' are women (Heather Mills, Amy Winehouse, Victoria Beckham, Kerry Katona,). These results will be discussed at a University of East Anglia seminar in June - 'Female Celebrity in the Tabloid, Reality and Scandal Genres' - but why bother? The only surprising thing about these results is that they're so unsurprising. Everyone knows that celebrity misogyny, the new blood sport of the masses, has been big business for years, hitting saturation point with Britney. Cold hearted, too; it's more a case of 'brands' failing and succeeding than anything human. As for the UEA event, it sounds great fun. Who could resist a lecture on 'Celebrity Transgression' - as if, usually, these attention-seeking fools are doing something incredibly useful?  Really though, they don't need to hold fancy seminars on this stuff - a Heat reader, bribed with a Crunchie, could tell them all they need to know in 10 minutes",Barbara Ellen: That's enough ladettes.

"Earthquake's don't destroy strong, well-built buildings, they destroy weak ones. As China reels from its biggest earthquake in 30 years, public anger is mounting. A third of the 20,069 confirmed dead (the number is expected to rise to 50,000) were children trapped in the 6,900 classrooms that the government says were destroyed - weaker than other buildings in withstanding the shock. It has also said that as many as 390 dams could be at risk. The danger for the Communist government is obvious. China is earthquake prone, Sichuan in particular experiencing a similar scale earthquake in 1933. China's geologists had warned there was a one-in-10 chance of a recurrence within 50 years and buildings and dams should have been built to strict regulatory standards. They weren't, especially those built most recently. This is not just corner cutting in the quest for fast growth, or the kind of loose practice that comes to light after disasters everywhere. It is the consequence of systemic non-enforcement of regulations in return for bribes - and everyone in China knows it.  The heartbreaking scenes have transfixed China and the world. Popular revulsion at avoidable deaths, especially when so many are children, could easily become overwhelming. China has been applauded for its fast and open reaction compared to the Burmese generals' stubborn refusal to mobilise domestic and international support in the aftermath of the cyclone - but self-preservation as much as humanitarian concern is driving the Communist party's actions.  After all, it has not been a good year. Inflation is at a 12-year high, the rail system is breaking down during snow storms and then there is Tibet. And now this. State Premier Wen Jiabao went to the disaster area the following day to make his concern visible, shouting to survivors that help was at hand and ordering action. 'Grandpa' Wen has become something of a national hero. President Hu Jintao followed him on Friday. But both needed to show from the beginning that whatever the shortcomings of local officials, the Beijing leadership, as it always likes to position itself, was on ordinary villagers' side.  The comments from local people showed how much it is needed. One mother told the Guardian: 'Chinese officials are too corrupt and bad ... They have money for prostitutes and second wives but they don't have money for our children.' It is the same story when it comes to food safety, drug standards or environmental regulations, of which only 10 per cent are enforced. Corruption is ubiquitous, which is why so many buildings were deathtraps. Another woman drew attention to the government and party buildings that remained standing, plainly built to the right specifications. The Politburo could anticipate what was going to be said; fast, open and effective action was its best riposte. The government has announced an investigation into why so many classrooms collapsed, but the answer is already known. People want the government to maintain the pace of development but increasingly do not accept that the price has to be corruption. The government agrees and launches unsuccessful anti-corruption drives. The problem is that local officials have unchecked, unaccountable power and have no compunction, given the loss of the belief that they are building a communist utopia, in helping themselves to cash on an ever grander scale. Professor Hu Angang, an economist at Tsinghua university, estimates that one yuan in six is, in effect, corrupt. Even army officers buy their rank.  This comes back to the weakness of China's civil society; it is not just that the courts and police are rigged, but there are few strong self-help groups and associations to hold officials to account. This lack is more obvious than ever during a disaster. Organisations like the Red Cross, Salvation Army, groups of amateur radio hams, churches, sports clubs, associations for the relief of the poor, missing persons groups, independent hospitals and all the others who might help are conspicuous by their absence. If they do exist they are tightly controlled and monitored by the party. The state and the party are all there are, and at times like these they are very exposed. Party ideologists like to criticise democracy for its inefficiency, but vehicles where dissent can be openly expressed are a vital safety valve and a way of improving government effectiveness. The US government's reaction to Hurricane Katrina was cruelly inadequate, but there were avenues and mechanisms for the US's dense network of outraged institutions in civil society to propose fundamental change for next time. Complex societies need active civil society institutions to help manage them. China is the weaker for their absence - and for a system through which they can express themselves.  In effect, the one party state is on trial. So far it has hardly put a foot wrong. The contrast both with Burma and with China's last big earthquake in 1976 could hardly be more marked. But importantly it had no choice. The party's first instinct was to try to prevent massive media coverage, but to refuse China's now enormous domestic media - and international news organisations - the opportunity to report a humanitarian disaster months away from the Olympics would have been political suicide. Even more important, as China gets richer and more wired, the government finds itself having to be more responsive to public opinion. Whatever its impressive reaction to date, Chinese people are suspending judgment. So far so good. But will corruption dog the relief effort? And will anything ever change, whatever government inquiries may find, as long as the state remains controlled by one party and civil society is kept weak?  China is at a crossroads. The pressures on the one party state are becoming immense - and one obvious response is to harness China's passionate nationalist sense of injustice to its cause, as it has over Tibet, and to become a nationalist authoritarian state. But Sichuan shows other forces at work: the widespread resentment at corruption; the demand to hold the government to account and the growing capacity to do so. The rest of Asia is finding its way to democracy, and refuseniks like Burma are pariahs. China, I am sure, will one day find its way to democracy too - and events last week will prove one more small part of the story.  · The Writing on the Wall, Will Hutton's book on China, is published by Little, Brown at £9.99.",Will Hutton: Beijing's quick response to disaster won't cover cracks of corruption,2008-05-17T23:05:21Z,Will Hutton,world
"As TS Eliot once argued, in relation to Hamlet: 'The only way of expressing emotion in the form of art is by finding an ""objective correlative""': a situation or chain of events which make the emotion connected with them seem inevitable. The trouble with Hamlet, the play, he thought, was that it hadn't got one. 'Hamlet [the man] is dominated by an emotion which is inexpressible, because it is in excess of the facts as they appear.' Some readers may experience a similar problem with Speaking for Myself by Cherie Blair. What, exactly, is her beef? So many of her emotions seem in excess of the facts as they appear. Why is she so extravagantly conceited, for instance, given what she has to boast about? So sexually flamboyant in the absence of discernible interest? What can explain the obsession with gynaecological matters and, even more so, with money?  Like Gertrude, whose behaviour provides too insubstantial a cause for Hamlet's disgust, Cherie's impecunious mother makes an inadequate pretext for her affluent daughter's lifelong miserliness and greed. But what may be most baffling, particularly to historians of the future as they struggle to comprehend how a whole generation came to be duped by the figment that was New Labour, is Mrs Blair's passionate self-pity. Although she never lets up about 'the press and its relentless campaign to paint me as a grasping, scheming embarrassment', the author supplies no material from this relentless campaign that would enable fair-minded readers to decide for themselves whether her sense of victimhood is justified or, on the contrary, yet more disturbing evidence that the woman who eagerly represented this country on foreign trips was a vainglorious liability on a scale previously unimagined. Still, some of us are old enough to recall, reasonably accurately, some of the stories to which she still objects. 'Cherie's style guru has fallen for a fraudster', for instance. Which was true. She complains how the Daily Mail 'ratcheted up its attacks on me', demanding to know - though Mr Blair could have answered just as well - if Leo had had the MMR. Doctors were also keen for the Blairs to help subdue a scare which threatened public health. Now she discloses that Leo had, indeed, been vaccinated, though she would not save lives at the time if it gave 'the press chapter and verse'. There were countless other negative, dreadfully personal stories of course, criticising Mrs Blair for being grabby and exhibitionist, dazzled by celebrities and obsessed with freebies and keen to exploit her status as the Prime Minister's wife. As her memoir confirms, most such reports were miserably inadequate. One never knew, for instance, that a friend called the Blairs the 'house bandits'. And why weren't we told at the time that this unelected appendage to Mr Blair was constantly agitating for some sort of official role, more commensurate with talents she has yet, even with these cobbled-together anecdotes behind her, to demonstrate to the world beyond employment law? 'The system was simply not geared to a Prime Minister's spouse who wanted to be involved,' Mrs Blair feistily complains. Though she certainly did her best to modernise arrangements; dispatching herself on missions where the his'n'hers prime ministerial outfit would review 'our soldiers' or drum up support for what was plainly 'our' war.  As some women observed at the time, Cherie's enlightened self-assertion rested on a very traditional foundation: her husband's career. Badgered about Iraq by fellow feminist Fiona Millar, she told her: 'If Tony tells me, as he does, that if we don't stop Saddam Hussein the world will be a more dangerous place, then I believe him, and in my view you and I should be supporting our men in these difficult decisions, not making it worse by nagging them.' Instead, Mrs Blair specialised in embarrassing Mr Blair right up to the day they left Downing Street with her 'I won't miss you' flung at the press. From her husband: 'You can't resist it, can you? For God's sake, you're supposed to be dignified, you're supposed to be gracious.' As her book assures us, that was never going to be possible: 'Part of the reason he loves me is my unpredictable character.' Just what one wants in a roving ambassadress! Has Mr Blair read any of this? Or is he only now enjoying, with us, the childbirth-bore yarns about third-degree tears, our introduction to her first period and the description of the funny feeling she got when she touched him at a party: 'I could feel a blush rise up from some uncharted part of me and flood my face.'  Like the two other men, David and John, she identifies as contending, simultaneously if unaware, for that sought-after region, Mr Blair will no doubt distinguish between the inescapable demands of the celebrity memoir and the serial abuses of her right to privacy to which Mrs Blair was so horrendously subjected. To anyone who fears that Blair will never be held account for his misdeeds, this doting assault on his reputation must be, at least, a first step along the road to karma. Should you be passing a bookshop, you may like to add to his pain by flicking through Speaking for Myself and finding the wedding photographs. Mrs Blair says his crotch looks peculiar in them (he's in borrowed underpants!). Most small mammals display a greater need for privacy. But for Blair, the most embarrassing thing about Speaking for Myself should be this further demonstration of the utter vacuity, moral and intellectual, of what his wife (who insists they worked as a team) still calls the 'New Labour agenda'. That she does not bother to chuck in, just for appearance's sake, a bit of idealistic political philosophy to balance the bitching about Gordon, and princessy tosh about trusted servants, is typical of this prolonged experiment in self-inflicted character assassination. Even at her silliest, Mrs Blair was widely believed to be the genuinely political article, a serious-minded, fundamentally principled corrective to her husband's shallower charms. But ambition, she says, is what united them. For years, Cherie was, in reality, as politically dormant as her husband. And today, as she sticks her knife into Gordon Brown while stressing, in a promotional interview, that she's still just an old-fashioned socialist, it seems almost as astonishing that we ever believed her or that the author of this catastrophically counterproductive apologia can be considered an ornament to the law. Actually, you wonder, if you started studying now, if it wouldn't be possible to sit the bar examinations in June, join Matrix Chambers in August, and be a part-time judge by, say, September. How hard, on this basis, can it be? If Cherie is not in reality anything like the person depicted in this book, then her reputation must be defended and fast. Though it's too late for an injunction, an ingenious lawyer like her should have something up her sleeve. Couldn't she sue herself for libel? Assuming that damages commensurate with this level of defamation would not amount to much, much more than £1m. We know they're a bit strapped.",Catherine Bennett: Whoops! She did it again.

"In Hollywood, producers let you know their intentions for a movie script by calling for certain ""types"". It's pretty euphemistic. Scripts looking for ""a Nicole Kidman type"" might persuade Naomi Watts to become attached to them. A Renee Zellweger type? You might get that one in Grey's Anatomy. A Lindsay Lohan type? Honey, these days Lindsay Lohan's taking scripts meant for a Lindsay Lohan type. The past year has not been kind. The practice of managing expectations in this way came to mind this week, when it emerged that Gordon Brown has been approached by the BBC to judge a young talent show called Junior PM, aimed at what its producers describe as ""an Apprentice meets Maria/Strictly Come Dancing audience"". You couldn't help thinking they were looking for ""an Alan Sugar type"", and after being rejected by several cheap imitations, eventually sighed: ""Well, I suppose we could settle for the prime minister.""  And weren't they in luck? Whereas Suralan would never have lowered himself to even read the proposal, Junior PM's producers only had to raise it with Hazel Blears for her to take it all the way to a bleeding cabinet meeting. Her special adviser confirmed that the communities secretary intended to raise it ""in the margins of cabinet"". I suppose we should be grateful it wasn't item one on the agenda at the table around which political titans of yesteryear once sat. But you are formally dared to imagine Barbara Castle turning to Harold Wilson and saying: ""Ooh, now, the Beeb has come up with a great idea in which you judge a telly talent contest. Hughie Green's turned it down, so unless Monkhouse fancies it, you should start looking grateful.""  In fact, it's difficult to decide which is more hilarious: that the running of Britain has now been relegated to the status of a telly prize, or that the BBC thinks the prime minister might actually say yes.  Put delicately, the idea of spending licence payers' money on a Gordon Brown vehicle is up there with Alan Partridge's legendary Monkey Tennis. The entire country knows Gordon is not what you'd call a TV natural. For the past couple of months he has only worn one expression: that of a man watching his legacy being torn down in slow motion. His telly outings already make us squirm in vicarious discomfort; it would be positively excruciating to see him dispensing a Simon Cowell-style verdict on some precocious little horror: ""That was the worse post-neoclassical endogenous growth theorising I've seen in the Birmingham auditions ..."" This isn't the Beeb's vision, apparently. ""It is a golden opportunity for the PM to gather a youth manifesto and become more popular than Alan Sugar,"" ran its pitch, and at some level you have to admire the misplaced confidence that Brown can afford to be worrying about the nine-year-old demographic, when his need to appeal to the already enfranchised would seem rather more pressing. ""It is a very worthy programme idea,"" a Blears spokesman insisted, as though the entertainment potential were not sufficiently moribund without a government press officer describing it as ""worthy"". ""The idea is to get more young people interested in politics."" But of course it is, because it is one of the orthodoxies of the age that more young people vote in reality TV elections than in general elections. Complete cobblers, as it goes, though I won't trouble you with the statistics.  That said, you'd think our mathlete of a prime minister might be aware of them, because he is absurdly, uncomfortably obsessed with reality TV. Last month he appeared on American Idol, but two years ago he was already outlining his vision of ""an X Factor Britain"", a comment that managed to combine fatuity, neediness, and a total failure to understand what these kind of talent shows are really about. They don't make dreams come true; they sell you disappointment, which is why every series includes more and more of the episodes focusing on deluded clods auditioning. And increasingly, doesn't Mr Brown's torment remind you of one of these tone-deaf unfortunates, whose painful progress makes you shriek ""How on earth did he think he could do this?"", and whom you can hardly bear to watch for the transferred embarrassment? Watching PMQs can feel like intruding on private grief, while the prime minister cannot seem to reverse the perception that he is faintly ridiculous. There is a sort of momentum to it now, where every one of these mooted stunts plays atrociously for him. It's just so easy to turn his gimmicks against him, a fact not lost on the Tories, who not only spent this week's PMQs making jokes about the electorate telling Mr Brown ""You're fired!"", but gave Strictly Come Dancing host Bruce Forsyth a special ticket to watch proceedings from the gallery. They do like to sledgehammer home a point in Westminster. Need they even have bothered? The episode barely needed glossing. Everything about Junior PM feels hackneyed, knackered and devoid of ideas - the format, the thinking behind it, but most of all its intended star. As Suralan would say: he hasn't got a bladdy clue. marina.hyde@theguardian.com",Marina Hyde: The X Factor vision spells disaster for its intended star,2008-05-17T10:30:27Z,Marina Hyde,politics
"What exactly happened on the No 74 bus? Right. I'm rolling up the sleeves of my imagination and I'm going to pummel some sexually explicit detail out of this doughy paragraph about the Blairs' first night together: ""Then Tony and I took the bus ... It was a double-decker and we went upstairs. It was completely empty and by the time we got off we knew each other better than when we'd got on. And even better the next morning."" It has to be sex, right? If they were chatting upstairs, it wouldn't have mattered whether or not it was empty. Besides which, we find out later in the chapter that they do their major chatting in the Tate. Galleries are for chat, buses are for sex and short, non-essential journeys. It couldn't have been full sex, though, because of that ""even better""; unless they did regular sex on the bus, and ... no. Sorry, I can't think why I even started down that cul-de-sac. They were two young lawyers after a Christmas party, not Seymour Butts and Jenna Jameson. A Routemaster, indeed road travel generally, is too jerky for anything oral. If it were just snogging, she would have just said snogging, wouldn't she? You don't say, ""Ladies and gentlemen, we, ahem, soon knew one another somewhat better"" if you're just on about a French kiss. I'm putting my money on tops and fingers. What is this ""contraceptive equipment"" of which she speaks? ""This year,"" Cherie writes, of their 1999 Balmoral visit, ""I had been a little more circumspect, and had not packed my contraceptive equipment out of sheer embarrassment."" It's a funny old phrase, isn't it? She can't mean the pill - nobody calls pills ""contraceptive equipment"", unless VIP women get a special belt-and-braces pill variant, which is a pill to be swallowed orally, a hard-hat and some barbed wire. It must be a cap, but I don't understand what is so embarrassing about a cap and nor, for that matter, do I understand this bit: ""The first year we had actually stayed - in 1998 - I had been extremely disconcerted to discover that everything of mine had been unpacked. Not only my clothes, but the entire contents of my distinctly ancient toilet bag with its range of unmentionables."" What else has she got, in this range? It sounds like fun, doesn't it? Has she considered launching Cherie's Unmentionables upon a waiting public? There might be a quid or two in it - she likes those. Just how awful is Alastair Campbell? Cherie is having a three-way phone call with her husband and Campbell following her 2002 miscarriage: ""There were implications in not going on holiday, they said. It was known that we were going to France. It was all to do with Iraq ... If we didn't go on holiday, the concern was that it would send out the wrong messages. They had decided that the best thing was to tell the press that I'd had a miscarriage. I couldn't believe it. There I was, bleeding, and they were talking about what was going to be the line to the press."" You know those people whose entire demeanour is a bit nefarious, but then when you make a joke about diabetes or something, they get up on their dignity and say, ""My uncle died of diabetes!"" and you think, ""Make your mind up, pal, are you Satan, or are you Pollyanna?"" Alastair Campbell has always struck me like that. And now I think we can safely say, well, he ain't Pollyanna. Will she ever have enough money? Jenni Murray asked Cherie Blair yesterday, on Woman's Hour (I'm paraphrasing), ""With all your money-grubbing and fussing about houses, don't you worry about the damage it does to the party of which you've been a passionate supporter all your life?"" And Cherie went, ""You're quite right to say I've been a passionate supporter of the Labour party all my life."" It bothers me when people talk of skill, in skirting difficult questions. There is no skill at all in this simple politician's dodge - the skill is exhibited by Jenni, in not bopping Cherie on her incredibly rich nose. Cherie was cross with Gordon Brown's suggestion that MPs forgo their payrise, at the start of TB's term, even though she was earning a quarter of a million pounds. She will rarely pay for even a rudimentary holiday villa. She and Tony have just bought John Gielgud's old house for £4m, as a retreat from the drudgery of their poky Connaught Square house, which is only worth £3.5m. And she's still on about how much she worries about money because her mum had to work in a chippie! She's like a bulimic, only with cash. How much does she hate Anji Hunter? Picture the scene: Labour party conference, 1994. Hunter, the PM's old friend and top aide, told Cherie not to go on to the conference floor but she did anyway, and then they had a spat in the lift, that went like this: ""'I thought I told you not to go down there, Cherie,' Anji said as she walked me down the corridor. 'You really don't understand politics.' 'Thank you, Anji, but I do understand politics.' If looks could kill, she should have been dead."" Ha. So that was Anji told. And now she's been told again! I can't see Anj recovering from biting wit like this. Roll over Oscar Wilde. Does she ever get cross with Tony? Cherie had a really gory birth with Euan, her first, and then Tony made her get her picture taken for the Northern Echo the very next day, and as she was falling asleep, she thought, I hate this man. And all that's fair enough, except that it's titled ""The Night I Hated Tony"", and I'm bothered by the singular. Just the one night? Your whole marriage? Really? Does anyone else still care about Euan's drunken episode, apart from Cherie? Again on Woman's Hour, Cherie described Euan's police caution at 16, and his response: ""Does that mean everyone will have forgotten about it when I'm 18?"" and her thinking, ""You poor thing, nobody will ever forget about it."" Except we would! I think we'd have forgotten about it almost entirely, if his parents didn't keep writing memoirs about it. On nights when Tony said he'd be home for dinner, and she'd rushed home to cook, only he didn't turn up until really late, what did she actually make? I only ask because I think some small detail, like a recipe or even just a list of ingredients, might help. At the moment, I can't seem to shake the idea that this has been completely made up. What did she like about Carole Caplin in particular? Cherie says she felt dreadful about the Caplin furore - she had a fight with Alistair Campbell, Tony was peeved, she'd ruined some or other triumphant day they've had, and all because she associated with a woman who used to be a topless model. But for all her penitence and discomfort, she wouldn't discontinue the association because it was nice for her to have friends who weren't involved in politics. Kinda ... but I've done a piece with Carole Caplin, a really long one, and met her a whole load of times, and I can tell you for a cast-iron fact that all she does is tell you how pretty and clever you are all day, and yet could be slightly prettier if you did more exercise and ate quinoa. So while I'm not writing off the idea that they had a meaningful friendship, well, yes, I am. I am writing it off. I bet you their friendship went like this: ""No wonder you're married to such a powerful man, Cherie. Look at your lovely teeth! How they match your sharp and pleasing intellect, which you accessorise beautifully with your lovely career, except for the wigs; you'd look much prettier without that silly wig ...",Zoe Williams asks a few more questions of Cherie Blair's memoirs,2008-05-16T09:47:50Z,Zoe Williams,review
"Edward Timpson is the Conservative candidate in the Crewe and Nantwich byelection, charged with taking on Labour's Tamsin Dunwoody, the daughter of the late Gwyneth. A 34-year-old son of the family behind the famous chain of British shoe shops, his upbringing was enlivened by the fact his parents fostered more than 80 children - many of whom, he says, were escaping ""very difficult starts in life"". On the face of it, he may look like an archetypal member of the moneyed Cheshire set, but this detail - along with the fact that he says he was inspired by his childhood to forge a career in family law, specialising in ""the welfare of vulnerable children"" - suggests something a bit more complicated; a belief, perhaps, in exactly the Cameroonian ""fraternity"" that some insightful Labour people are beginning to take very seriously. But never mind all that. The Labour campaign, under the command of the Birmingham MP Steve McCabe, has rebranded its chief adversary ""Tory Boy Timpson"", and is going for him with an eye-popping ferocity. Volunteers have been stalking him dressed in top hat and tails; now, there comes a very nasty leaflet titled ""Tory candidate application form"", replete with questions and ticked boxes. Number one is, ""Do you live in a big mansion house?"" Question two is - and, really, the sense of humour on display is quite something - ""Do you think that regeneration is adding a new wing to your mansion?"" The third reads: ""Have you and your Tory mates on the council been soft on yobs and failed to make our streets safer?"" But the best is saved for question four, at which point pantomimic class hatred is suspended and we get something altogether more sinister. ""Do you,"" it asks, ""oppose making foreign nationals carry an ID card?"" Though the Tories seem to be hardly mentioning it, the presence of immigration in the campaign isn't a surprise. What's unsettling is the language used by Labour, and the implication of a tough measure to be wrought on uncooperative outsiders. It has to be said: there are deeply unpleasant historical echoes here that would cause any decent person to blanch, but the people behind the Dunwoody campaign surely know exactly what they're doing.  There has been a Polish community in Crewe since the 1940s, but as many as 6,000 Poles have made their home there during the past four years. According to the BBC, Cheshire police unofficially estimate that they make up one in 10 of the town's population. Local schools are inevitably feeling the pressure, and though the social fabric seems to be holding up, things have hardly been easy. With all that in mind, the essential Labour strategy is clear enough: not to concentrate on anything progressive or inspiring but to run instead on a mixture of the Dunwoody bloodline, utterly witless class warfare, and the politics of fear. One wonders what the more shrill aspects of the party's campaign will do for Crewe's community relations - but there again, it's doubtful that such thoughts are troubling many Labour high-ups. Misanthropic nastiness, after all, seems to be a central plank of the government's fightback. This stuff has a pedigree dating back well into the Blair years but seems to be turning ever more ugly. Among the first announcements in the wake of May 1 was a loud Home Office pledge to try to realise Brown's drive for ""British jobs for British workers"", by forcing employers to prove no Briton can fill a vacancy before offering it to anyone from outside the EU. Soon after, there came Jacqui Smith's bizarre plans to ""harass"" badly behaved youths using video cameras and a technique hyped as ""frame and shame"". Going back a few months, one thinks also of James Purnell's proposed clampdown on the long-term jobless, Caroline Flint's priceless proposal that the workshy should be threatened with homelessness, and the government's increasingly baffling drive on ""Britishness"", in which fine words about inclusion are often overshadowed by the sense of dog-whistles being desperately sounded.  Given the absence of any comprehensible government message, such talk - much of which, as Charles Clarke recently put it, ""flatters some of the most chauvinistic and backward-looking parts of British society"" - is now in danger of drowning everything else out. Moreover, as the voters of Crewe may well have surmised, none of it adds up. While seizing on fears about immigration, Brown has still made no headway on the issue of agency workers, which underlies so many modern tensions. At the same time as maligning many of the nation's youth as yobs, Labour also wrings its hands about their ""unlocked talent"". Apparatchiks are encouraged to wage class war for the cameras, but the government refuses to talk about compelling the ultra-wealthy to pay their way, or to make any move on, say, the totemic issue of charitable status for private schools. The impression is of politics at its most dried-up and disingenuous. The result: activists and once-loyal supporters decide to leave the party well alone, and floating voters decide that Cameroonian confidence and optimism is much the better option. And so to a question focused 150-odd miles south of Crewe. As Labour lays waste to what remains of its progressive credentials, one thinks immediately of that handful of young(ish) Brownites - Ed Miliband, Douglas Alexander, Ed Balls, Yvette Cooper - who usually go out of their way to talk up the party's supposed soul, and the parts of the government's record that reflect it. Where are they, and why won't they speak up?  Even if what they had to say was couched in the obligatory political code, we'd know it when we heard it. Behind the scenes, they must surely alert Brown to a simple choice: cut this stuff out and rediscover that moral compass - or bequeath them a political husk so robbed of its essential identity that it will take at least a generation to even begin to revive it. David Cameron's recent pronouncements are not nearly as surreal as they sound: right now, the Tories really are sounding more progressive than Labour, and that way lies not just electoral defeat, but the prospect of complete wipe-out. john.harris@theguardian.com",John Harris: The tactics of Crewe expose a truly nasty party: Labour,2008-05-15T08:25:17Z,John Harris,politics
"Today is the first day of the rest of Gordon Brown's life. He has put the 10p tax debacle behind him, thanks to yesterday's £2.7bn compensation package, and now he can begin the fightback. A draft Queen's speech this afternoon, steady through the summer, a new thrust during the party conference season and before you know it, the much-battered prime minister will be back in the game.  That, at least, is the scenario the folks in Downing Street are sketching out. For sheer creativity and optimism of the human spirit, the Brown team deserve credit for the way they're trying to buck themselves up. In several conversations over the past week, you had to be impressed with their ability to wade through the sludge and sewage coming their way every day from every possible direction - a now largely hostile press, former ministers, Labour MPs and, through the opinion polls, the general public - and still find the odd bright diamond.  Start with the 10p row. No 10 admits that if the government and the electorate were husband and wife then 10p was a stormer of a row, loud and nasty. There had to be an apology and the rapid making of amends. But was it one of those ""the wife"" will never forgive or forget? Downing Street doesn't think so. ""It wasn't the poll tax,"" says one close to the top.  With that out of the way, the government reckons it can now get on with reminding voters - especially those in Crewe - that Labour, and particularly Brown, have always been on the side of the poorest and are there to help the squeezed middle class. This matters, says Team Brown, because the disastrous showing in this month's local elections did not represent a profound emotional shift in the country, an outright rejection, but rather a cry of voters' pain over the state of their wallets and household budgets. The fact that this ""pocketbook agenda"" has become the crucial battleground is in fact good for the government, say the insiders, because that's terrain Labour can regain. Not least because it is in power rather than in opposition: ""We can actually do things."" Indeed, No 10 believes the current economic gloom explains almost everything. People worry that life is hard - and 10p fleetingly made them feel the government was making things harder - so it's no wonder they gave Labour a kicking. When things pick up again, that anxiety will recede. That, they reckon, is a far cry from the drubbing John Major took in local polls in 1995: back then, the economy was returning to health, and yet the government still got a beating. Major's Tories could blame nothing and no one but themselves.  What other lines of argument are the Brown circle using to lift their spirits? Some are agedly familiar. They note that politics and the media are both fickle businesses and that storylines change. One senior official says that when he started in his post several months ago, he asked a procession of ministers, MPs, trade union leaders and commentators what landmines might surface in the period ahead. Not one so much as mentioned 10p tax, still less warned that it could bring trouble. So yes, things changed rapidly and for the worse over the last few months, but they could just as easily change in the other direction. And there is time, a good two years of it.  More tangibly, the Brown folk point to the issues their boss has successfully neutralised without anyone noticing. Nuclear power looked set to bring trouble for Brown, but it hasn't. The NHS was a toxic issue just one year ago, they add, yet Alan Johnson got a standing ovation when he addressed the Royal College of Nurses a fortnight ago.  If you think all this sounds like an almighty, even heroic, exercise in clutching at straws, try two more of the comfort blankets being handed out at Downing Street. My second favourite has to be the admission that, sure, the non-election, the bungling of the Olympic torch and the signing-but-no-ceremony of the Lisbon Treaty were all goofs, but they didn't actually hurt anyone. As one aide puts it, in an acid if tacit comparison with Tony Blair: ""At least we've not invaded any countries.""  But surely the prize goes to this interpretation of Boris Johnson's victory in London, offered to me last week. It argues that both Johnson and David Cameron are in fact ""perverse beneficiaries of 12 years of New Labour"". How's that? Because the Britain of 2008 is a place where people are more relaxed about class background than they were before 1997, with the old snobberies (inverted and otherwise) in retreat. Thanks to New Labour, no one gets too exercised if two men form a civil partnership and, likewise, no one gets too stressed about the school a Tory politician went to. Like I said, you've got to hand it to the men of the bunker for their ingenuity and stubborn optimism. Some will call it delusion, but I hope they're right - that somehow the long agony that began with the election that never was can be halted. And yet outside the Brown inner circle I find little confidence that it can.  One senior cabinet minister's first reaction to the 24% share in the May 1 polls was to say, ""It can get worse."" He conjures the figure 16% as a possible rock-bottom for Labour's standing. Others agree with No 10 that the ideological sea-change has not yet come, but they do worry that the government now seems alarmingly out of tune with the times, as if it no longer gets the public mood. In this respect, if only in his tone and his body language, David Cameron has the advantage. It seems lame to dump all blame for this on the leader, and yet some of Brown's most senior colleagues can't help themselves. They lament Brown's focus either on micro-tactics or on some far-off long term - missing out the coherent, tangible action on a substantive scale that lies halfway between the two. They believe that individuals are plugging away in their own ministries and yet the government is less than the sum of those parts. Why? Because all that work is lent no focus from the top. ""There is no leadership,"" says one minister with brutal concision.  Despite all the sunny talk from Downing Street, this is hardening into a fixed view. And that produces some dark thinking. I heard one cabinet minister say that the choice for 2010 is now ""between losing and getting slaughtered"". That's right: senior Labour figures are working out how they can merely be beaten by the Conservatives next time, rather than being wiped out. Now, I'm not one of those looking forward to a Labour defeat in 2010. But in my bleaker moments, I do wonder if it wouldn't actually be better for Brown to lose next time than to cling on for a Majoresque fourth term. It's quite clear that the party now needs to have an internal debate about its very purpose - a debate it missed last year by skipping straight to Brown - and that is precisely what a spell in opposition is for. Besides, a defeat in 2010 would be recoverable: it could be like 1970, with Labour returning four years later. But if the party were to soldier on, as Major did, 2015 would bring a massacre that would exile Labour for a generation - and the Conservatives would be back in for another 18 years. That would be bad for Labour - and worse for the country. freedland@theguardian.com",Jonathan Freedland: Better Labour lose power in 2010 than end up exiled for a generation,2008-05-13T23:15:13Z,Jonathan Freedland,politics
"Is it ethical to make fun of toffs? Is it even ethical to call a toff a toff? As their power and prominence in public life increases, to the point that the Daily Telegraph has already welcomed a new tolerance for unabashed displays of extreme poshness, the question becomes daily more pressing. Yet ethical consensus is so hard to find. Within the Labour party, opinion is sharply divided, with Ed Balls, on one side, attacking the 'privileged few' and Jon Cruddas, on the other, nervously dismissing a futile preoccupation with 'posh boys'. Beyond Westminster, it remains unclear whether sympathisers with the top-hatted satirists currently hounding Edward Timpson in Crewe and Nantwich actually outnumber gentler progressives, who believe that to persecute members of the toff community in this way is a betrayal of every anti-discriminatory principle their movement has historically held dear. It is curious, certainly, to hear young Timpson having to insist, after Tamsin Dunwoody called him a 'rich kid Tory', that being the heir to a cobbling fortune does not necessarily make him a bad person. 'I come from a family who have fostered over 80 children from difficult backgrounds and my two younger brothers are both adopted,' he pleaded in a very British version of Obama's race speech. 'My mother Alex worked as a nursery nurse.' Beat that, Dunwoody. Indeed, in an ideal world, it is Timpson, the most tender-hearted of our younger patricians, who would surely be the more natural Labour candidate, challenging the blood-heiress to Crewe and Nantwich in the name of change and equal opportunities.  As it is, Timpson's pain reminds us that it will not do, any more, for toffists to stigmatise the privileged, on the basis that an accident of insanely good fortune is preferable to one of doomed deprivation. The hapless victim of affluence, George Osborne, for instance, cannot help being named after a brand of wallpaper, any more than Boris Johnson chose to call himself 'de Pfeffel' or David Cameron elected to put himself through Eton - a 'great school', incidentally, as he 'fessed up on Newsnight not long ago. But the toffs' tormentors will not let up. Just last week, Cameron was forced to stand up and 'fess again: 'Yes, I am wealthy, I have a very well-paid job and so does my wife.' But if you prick him, does he not bleed? Or as he put it, with a simplicity which put some in mind of a young Orwell: 'I drive my own car. I fill it up at the pumps and when diesel hits 121.9p per litre, which I paid outside Chipping Norton a couple of weeks ago, it really struck me that this whole tank is costing me £10 to £15 more than previously.'  Instead of lampooning Cameron's otherness, his critics might want to celebrate cultural diversity, with the re-emergence in public life of a particular Tory type which was thought, until recently, to have dwindled almost to the point of extinction. Although the recent explosion in the number of breeding pairs is certainly impressive, Westminster, looked at as a whole, is very far from being 'swamped', as alarmists from Toff Watch have put it, by Cameron's patrician army. Rather like Poles in Lincolnshire, it is just that its membership tends to concentrate in certain localities: Notting Hill for instance; Chipping Norton; the shadow cabinet. As they have every right to do. No one, I think, really wishes to return to the kind of bigoted hate-speech that began to sound old fashioned three decades ago, when Mrs Thatcher, declared class a 'communist concept', a unifying project continued by John Major, groping towards his 'classless society' and latterly by Tony Blair, who objected, early in his career, to Marxism's 'false view of class'.  Understandably, perhaps, it is survivors of the pre-classless society who seem to have most difficulty with Thatcher and Blair's combined legacy: an open and inclusive community in which David Cameron, an utterly conventional Tory member of White's, enjoys just as much right to call himself a progressive as an actual progressive. Or an even greater right, to judge by his boast last week, of a commitment to 'equal opportunity and social mobility' that eclipses anything you will find on the left. Though it might take more than that to convince people who recently advertised in the Guardian their horror of a Boris mayoralty or willingness to emigrate in the event of a Bullingdon hat-trick: Johnson as mayor of London, Cameron as Prime Minister, and Osborne as chancellor. Ian Jack, for example, surely spoke for many incredulous plebeians when he wondered, in advance of the local elections, 'why the leadership of the likely next British government has been drawn from such a narrow and privileged seam of British society'.  But Cameron could not declare (in a voice which has never, unlike Blair's, betrayed a trace of crowd-pleasing mockney) 'I am wealthy' and two days later that he will be 'making British poverty history' if he did not feel confident that much of the electorate has now been trained to see privilege from a more enlightened perspective. Tories are not alone in interpreting the latest election results as proof that the public is not particularly distressed, nowadays, by the brilliant spectacle of noblesse oblige. Labour's uneasy silence on Westminster's OE population explosion reportedly reflects their PR Stephen Carter's conviction that old-fashioned class rhetoric has become a vote loser. But does the change not go further than that? What has become of a nation that responds with such joyous enthusiasm to the obvious emetic that is Cameron's (now suppressed) Bullingdon Club photograph? Unless it was misplaced pity. Possibly the extraordinary appearance of the Bullers in their archaic regalia suggested to the untutored eye that the poor lads must have been forced to join against their will, around the same time that Tom Brown was roasting Smike in Jennings's tuckshop. But Cameron has already pre-empted wider dissemination of what actually went on in this puking little brotherhood, arguing that he (and presumably the same goes for Johnson and Osborne) could not have been expected, as a university student in the late Eighties, to behave like a civilised person, on the off chance that he may one day decide to lead the country. Shouldn't we condemn a little less? Put ourselves in his place? Didn't many of us, as carefree students, hanker after admission to a sporadically violent, all-male, proudly philistine drinking club, where you could learn to vomit into a binbag, so as not to leave the dining table? And look at it this way: in a country where thousands of youngsters regularly explore Bullingdonesque depths of degradation, a handful of seasoned vandals around the cabinet table could be just what the doctor ordered. Has Brown ever had the illuminating experience that is trashing a restaurant? Or Miliband of hijacking a Portaloo? For the Bullingdon boys, their imminent triumph only confirms what their class has always known: that between the natural ruler and the lowliest have-not there exists an elemental bond that no bourgeois triumphalist will ever understand. That's why Cameron hugs hoodies. Wealth, and vomitorium choices, aside, they have much in common.","Catherine Bennett: The toffs are back - and, frankly, no one gives a damn",2008-05-10T23:06:03Z,Catherine Bennett,politics
"Browsing through an American bookshop does not lift the spirits. Books that chart the end of American supremacy, predict wars over finite natural resources, study the squeezed middle class or the catastrophic Bush presidency proliferate. The United States is going through a period of introspection and the Boston bookshelves, at which I spent part of last week, heave with the results. In one respect, it is hardly surprising. Iraq, Afghanistan and the rise of China. The credit crunch. The $124 a barrel oil price. The unbelievable unfairness of Bush's tax cuts. The racism and violence that still pockmark American life. Yet the pessimism is overdone. The more I visit the US the more I think the pundits predicting the US's imminent economic and political decline hugely overstate their case. Rather, the next 50 years will be as dominated by the US as the last 50. The US will widen its technological and scientific dominance, sustain its military hegemony, launch a period of reindustrialisation and continue to define modernity both in culture and industry. The fashionable view is that the American economy is a busted flush, a hollowed-out, deindustrialised shell housed in decaying infrastructure that delivers McJobs and has survived courtesy only of a ramped-up housing market and the willingness of foreigners to hold trillions of dollars of American debts.  China and India are set to overtake it in the foreseeable future. At best, the US will have to get used to living in a multipolar world it cannot dominate. At worst, it will have to accept, along with the West, that the new economic and political heart of the world is Asia. The US economy is certainly in transition, made vastly more difficult by the spreading impact of the credit crunch. But the underlying story is much stronger. The country is developing the prototypical knowledge economy of the 21st century, an economy in which the division between manufacturing and services becomes less clear cut, in a world where the deployment of knowledge, brain power and problem-solving are the sources of wealth generation.  What counts is the strength of a country's universities, research base, commitment to information and communications technology and new technologies along with a network of institutions that supports new enterprise. Here, the US is so far ahead of the rest of the world it is painful. The figures make your head spin. Of the world's top 100 universities, 37 are American. The country spends more proportionately on research and design, universities and software than any other, including Sweden and Japan. Of the world's top 50 companies ranked by R&D, 20 are American. Fifty-two of the world's top 100 brands are American. Half the world's new patents are registered by American companies.  This year, American exports have grown by 13 per cent, helped by the falling dollar, so that the US has reclaimed its position as the world's number one exporter. Moreover, and little remarked on, two-thirds of America's imports come from affiliates of American companies that determinedly keep most of the value added in the US. The US certainly has a trade deficit, but importantly it is largely with itself. The US will recover from the credit crunch. Already there is an aggression and activism about how to respond that makes the British look limp in comparison. Four-fifths of new mortgages are underwritten by public mortgage banks, interest rates have been slashed and a bank bail-out was launched instantly. More activism is planned. There is a dynamic readiness to fix things in a tight economic corner, irrespective of ideology, that can only be admired. It is a dynamism that infects the political process. I was in the US on the day Indiana and North Carolina went to the polls in the Democratic primaries. The conventional wisdom is that Obama and Clinton's fight is self-defeating and it would be better if Clinton had stood down earlier. I disagree. It has brought politics alive. Democrats are enrolling to vote in their hundreds of thousands because their vote and opinion now count. They will stay enrolled and vote in November. There is also a great maturity about the process. It is a political argument that necessarily demands respect for your opponent because if you win you will need their support in November. Americans do public argument well. The tradition might have corrupted since de Tocqueville made the same observation in 1835, but it lives on. And it is a vital underpinning of American success. It is this strange cocktail of argument, of plural institutions that check and balance, of investing in knowledge and of a belief that no problem can't be fixed that underpins American strength. China is the only country in the world with a similar continental-scale economy and bigger population that conceivably could mount a challenge, but it has none of these institutions and processes. Despite its size, it has only three universities in the top 100, not one brand in the top 100, not one company in the world top 50 ranked by R&D and it registers virtually no patents. China has no tradition of public argument, nor independent judiciary. Unless and until its institutions change, it will always trail the US in the 21st century knowledge economy and experience upheaval and possible revolution along the way. India, a democracy with the right institutions, is much better placed - but with income per head 2 or 3 per cent of that in the US, a challenge will take centuries rather than decades. It is the maligned EU that has the institutions and economic prowess to emerge as a genuine knowledge economy counterweight to America. Sure, the US has problems. It runs its financial system like a casino. It is a grossly unfair society. Its road and rail systems have been neglected for decades. University entrance has become too expensive. It has fetishised deregulation. Money corrupts its political process. To compromise the rule of law in order to 'win' the war on terror was stupid. But none of those problems can't be fixed and the US is about to elect a President who will promise to try, in a world in which it remains the indispensable power.  Anybody who would prefer China's communists needs to see their doctor. The greatest danger is that we start believing the pessimism. The United States is - and remains - formidable. Which is just as well for all of us.",Will Hutton: Forget the naysayers - America remains an inspiration to us all,2008-05-10T23:06:03Z,Will Hutton,world
"Was anything so old-fashioned as Labour's response to its drubbing at last week's polls? For the past four days the prime minister and his colleagues have sat stunned in a time warp. He appeared besuited on a Sunday television sofa, looking like a wet afternoon and talking about ""getting our message across"" and telling ""the truth about the Tories"". His friends spoke of relaunches and policy revamps, of ""reconnecting with core voters"" and deriding people they called ""toffs"". This is not so much a repeat of John Major in the mid-90s as of Harold Macmillan in the early-60s, who just wished that the 20th century would go away. The Brownites clearly wish the same of the 21st. Just when Brown was moaning about the horrors of being ""a private person in a public arena"" his youthful nemesis, Boris Johnson, was camping it up in a policeman's hat at a Sikh festival in Trafalgar Square. It was Labour's nightmare, an Etonian politician behaving like a human being rather than a political nerd, and being cheered for it.  When Brown wakes up in the morning, so he told BBC radio, he first thinks of people's hardship and mortgage rates. Most people think of a cup of tea. While Brown never apologises, Johnson says, ""Oh gosh, crikey, I've done it again. I'm sorry, let's rerun that."" The truth is that people seem not to mind a politician's accent if he can just contrive to sound reasonably normal, and nothing does normal better than humour. The only Labour politician who could handle it was Ken Livingstone and he is gone, ""out-sincered"" by Johnson.  The strategists of Brown's counter-revolution still miss the point about the new politics. They echo their leader about communicating policy messages as if all they needed was a touch of the Alastair Campbells. They demand that Brown rid the Labour party of unpopular measures and take that old carthorse, ""the policy agenda"", out of its shed, put young James Purnell in the saddle and feed it with Treasury hay. Small wonder the electorate's eyelids fall shut. For a minority of low-income voters, I can see that the end of the 10% tax rate was a burning issue. It also demoralised party workers charged with getting out the vote, a factor always underrated by Westminster politicians. But the time to kill it was when Brown announced it in 2007, to the sycophantic applause of those who voted it through and to whom he could do no wrong. A man then greeted as the authentic reaffirmation of old Labour after Tony Blair's charismatic cul-de-sac is now dismissed as dumb, directionless and depressing. With friends like these, who needs enemies? The truth is that Labour MPs and their constituency parties are paying the price for the evisceration of their vital organs by the Blairites (including Brown) in the mid-90s. A virtue of the old party constitution was that warnings of dissent were flashed to headquarters overnight. New Labour has no equipment to handle rebellion, turning each mishap into a humiliating public climb-down by the leadership.  The glory of democratic politics is its constant self-redefinition. The legacy of Blair and his court to the British constitution was the electoral supremacy of persons over programmes, of likability and familiarity, vision and abstract nouns, over the machinery of the governmental engine room. The political theorist David Runciman refers to this in his new book, Political Hypocrisy, as ""the necessary mask of power"". Blair was a superb salesman of the compromises (and hypocrisies) of leadership and there is no point, says Runciman, in ""denouncing it, or taking sides, or seeking some sort of personal insulation from it"". Today's democrats must rather decide ""what sort of hypocrites we want our politicians to be"". The given answer is those aware of their own hypocrisy and able to share its pretences with the electorate. From the moment David Cameron took over the Conservative party in 2005, he was advised to steer clear of policy, to stick instead to such vacuities as compassionate conservatism and ""social responsibility"". Every pollster asserted that, with democracy no longer about some great clash of class or economic interest, voters wanted their leaders to be reassuring, celebrated, pleasant on television and somehow therefore trustworthy in a crisis. This was a truth, not some transient Blairite quirk. Watch any American election.  Voters may claim crime and law and order, immigration, health and education as ""important issues"" when asked. But there is no evidence that these are electoral determinants. Besides, parties steal such policies from each other with abandon. Livingstone and Johnson in London were swapping policies like Christmas presents. More ominous for Labour is the poor personal rating of Brown as a leader, that and a widespread disbelief in what the government says and in its ability to make Britain a better place or improve its public services - so says Ipsos Mori's end-of-year review. Above all, people want government to be competent - or at least to appear to be. They do not want ever more policies, but rather a plausible navigator of their comfort zones. Nor is there any point in damning them for it. Brown's friends are demanding that he now declare petrol cheaper, housing more expensive (through subsidised purchase) and rubbish disposal more wasteful. This desperate scurrying beneath the bribery counter is the ultimate retreat from the radical honesty that was once Brown's strongest suit. He would be better advised to cheer up, stick to his guns and attempt some charisma implant, like Major's summoning of Michael Heseltine from the backbenches in 1990. He needs to borrow some of what his ever-chirpy critic, Jon Cruddas MP, yesterday called Cameron's ""emotional literacy"".  There is a tide in the affairs of politicians and, when it passes, ""all the voyage of their life / Is bound in shallows and in miseries"". Last week the Brown and Livingstone campaigns looked old and tired, and the electorate noticed. It wants novelty and is without prejudice. Despite the jeers of the commentariat, people seem happy to give the toffs a turn at the wheel. Besides, they don't mind an occasional joke, and even quite like it. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com",Simon Jenkins: Policy won't cut it.

"Years ago, while in Los Angeles, I took a tour where one sat in a hearse driven by a man dressed as an undertaker, to be taken around sites of the deaths, suicides and scandals of the rich and famous. Sure it was ridiculous, but sick? Not really, for the simple reason that most of the people were long gone (stars of the Twenties and Thirties), while others had expired in such a public way (River Phoenix convulsing on the street outside the Viper Room) that it was impossible to feel any sense of intrusion.  All this sprang to mind when I read about how Praia da Luz was attracting a new kind of tourist: sightseers intent upon doing the 'Maddie tour' - gawping at everything from the apartment she disappeared from to the restaurant where the 'Tapas Seven' dined, even the church in which they prayed for her safe return. These included Portuguese and Spanish groups, as well as other nationalities, including the British.  The participation of the Portuguese and Spanish is bizarre enough, but what really struck me was the muted public outcry in the UK, especially considering the stink when the McCanns contemplated a 'docu-movie deal' earlier this year. Or is it a case of one rule for them (the McCanns must be tasteful at all times) and another for us (go on, be a ghoul)? And since when were scenes of child abduction considered 'must-sees' for tourists anyway? How does that work as a conversation over the holiday cornflakes? 'We'll swim this afternoon and see where that little girl got abducted straightaway, you know, before it gets too crowded'?  Or maybe it's that these 'Maddie tours' are a microcosm of a far bigger issue - that her disappearance is fast becoming an international franchise in danger of spiralling out of her parents' control. Indeed, one wonders, how soon before 'Maddie' copyright issues emerge - the unseemly global scrabble over who owns the 'rights' to Madeleine? In six months' time, will she still 'belong' to her family or, just as with the Praia da Luz tours, will there be a surreal, money-grabbing free for all?  My guess is that the McCanns should brace themselves, because sections of the British public have form, one minute grieving alongside the parents of murdered or kidnapped children, the next 'moving on' (translation: getting bored) and leaving them to it. What else could explain the fact that despite the pain of the relatives, few others complained or cared when 'artworks' appeared, made out of the images of James Bulger being led away, or children's hands making up Myra Hindley's face, all in the cause of 'social commentary'?  Maybe this partly explains the McCanns' determination to make the most of the anniversary of the abduction, resulting in that somewhat overlong (dare I say dreary) two-hour documentary and the push for a European version of the US fast response 'Amber Alert' for missing children. They kept saying it was their 'last chance', but of what - maintaining control?  For when Gerry McCann said last week: 'We are not characters in a soap opera', he must have been aware that to many, that is exactly what they are. What's more, they are characters in danger of being written out, no longer considered necessary for the 'Maddie franchise' to continue. Already, 'cold Kate' has become 'too emotional Kate' since crying in the documentary. And how many more times can they be asked why they left their children alone?  While some may argue that the scenes in Praia da Luz are no different from the tourists who view the Paris tunnel where Diana died or New York's Ground Zero, they are wrong - both these instances, like the tour I took in LA, deal at least with a form of 'dead pain'. By contrast, with Madeleine still missing, and the event only a year old, the McCanns' pain is live and active.  What the Maddie tours seem to prove is that the people following a story can often behave worse than the people living it. As the McCanns were using Madeleine's anniversary to do 'good', promoting Amber Alert, certain of their countrymen were posing with Cornettos by the apartment where their daughter disappeared. Furthermore, many others weren't too bothered to hear about it. Whichever way you cut it, it's a new low. Beware vengeful mothers armed with walking sticks It wasn't maudlin, it was lovely, that Frank Lampard wore a black armband, and dedicated a vital penalty to his recently deceased mother at Chelsea's Champions League match against Liverpool last week. How many football games is that man going to play and how many mums does he have? It seems a simple enough equation.  By contrast, cult French novelist Michel Houellebecq is rumoured to have based some unflattering characters on his mother, 83-year-old Lucie Ceccaldi. His breakthrough novel, 1998's Atomised, features an ageing degenerate, mysteriously also called Ceccaldi, who fecklessly abandons her children for a new life in a torrid sex commune.  Now Ceccaldi, who from pictures I've seen, rather wonderfully resembles Mother Teresa's evil twin, has her own memoirs out, L'Innocente, and slams Houellebecq as arrogant, pretentious, a talentless upstart and a petit con ('little git') who'd do anything for fame and fortune. In an interview given to French literary magazine Lire, Ceccaldi says: 'My son, he can fuck off!' She says if Houellebecq writes another word about her, 'he's going to get hit in the gob with a walking stick and that'll knock all his teeth out, that's for sure'.  Houellebecq's books are chiefly infamous for their virulent misogyny and people have wondered where it came from. Mystery solved.

"There is a Downing Street bylaw which states that all wives of prime ministers must produce at least one twee book in thinly disguised support of either their husband's predicament - being prime minister - or their own. Mary Wilson had her poetry, and Norma Major did a book about Chequers, while Cherie Blair gave us The Goldfish Bowl, an unsurprisingly sympathetic and (even less surprisingly) money-spinning look at the business of being married to a PM. In accordance with this statute, Sarah Brown is soon to publish Dads, or, to give it its full, somewhat emetic title, Dads: A Celebration of Fatherhood From Britain's Finest and Funniest. Dads seems to be aimed squarely at that till-side spot reserved for screamingly funny tales from the 19th hole, or The Little Book of Calm. I say ""soon to publish""; in fact, Mrs Brown's book is not out for almost a month, but for reasons upon which one can only speculate, it was serialised this very week in - where else? - the Daily Mail. Calling all psephologists: what is the ratio of tedious celebrity anecdotes about fatherhood to local council seats not lost? About 960:1 on the exit polls, but perhaps the dads have salvaged a little more now the results are in.  But back to The Little Book of Why My Gordon's Human (""an enchanting new book"" - the Daily Mail). You would hesitate to class Dads as groundbreaking, in that it falls back on the hackneyed device of asking a lot of celebrities to provide contributions. Here's one from the Kumars star Sanjeev Bhaskar; there's one from Ronnie Corbett; and - oh do look - here's the lengthiest one by miles from a certain Gordon Brown, whom we must assume falls into the Britain's Finest, as opposed to Britain's Funniest, category. Profits-wise, the PM's wife will be giving a percentage to charity, though the celebrities are thought to have contributed for free. Downing Street declined to confirm the precise economics yesterday. Still, that's all by the by, because we all know that the real aim of this book is to showcase Gordon's ethereal affinity with fatherhood - that state so fetishised by the male politicians de nos jours.  Gordon was due another de-weirding on this front, because it has been two years since his ""at home"" with the Daily Mirror, who were invited to survey the charming chaos wreaked by his toddler son, John.  Since then he has been quite eclipsed by those David Cameron web videos, in which all the Cameron progeny play their part. As paterfamilias, Dave signs the release forms for his brood, to whom he was most recently shown being nice in an ITN exclusive designed to show he's just like us. And yet, by choosing to parade his offspring in regularly screened domestic tableaux in which they have no choice but to appear, one can't help feeling that Cameron is not so much like us, but more like the celebrities who court at-homes in OK! magazine. He is certainly no different from the ever-resourceful Jordan, who attracts criticism for allowing her disabled son to be photographed, except that she's doing it for material capital, while Cameron's in it for political capital.  ""What my son has taught me about caring"", runs the headline on one Cameron article, whereas Brown almost fell over himself to explain that fatherhood ""does make you think all the time what parents need"".  It is bad enough that public life is beginning to feel like an episode of Kids Say the Funniest Things, but even worse to hear Brown statements such as ""Alongside millions juggling the pressures of work, I struggle too to be what I want to be - a good parent.""  Oh, not the juggling ... Please not the juggling. There is little more insulting than people who patently occupy another world telling you they're just like you in order to ingratiate themselves - it is more irksome even than celebrities who speak about the advent of a baby as though they are the first person ever to have given birth.  So removed is the top-flight political experience - how could it not be? - that all attempts to find common ground with your average Joe are so reductive as to be meaningless. Cherie Blair tried it with motherhood on one notable occasion. As a reminder of that particular struggle to juggle: she had just been forced to buy £500,000 worth of luxury flats in Bristol with the help of a famous conman, then lie about it to the No 10 press office, because - and here came the crack in her voice - her son was going away to university for the first time. At the time, people remarked that at least little Ewan wasn't going away to her husband's war, as were so many others of his age; and a similar scepticism seems appropriate in the case of our current PM. Since taking office, Brown has shown no sign of moving to increase paternity leave, nor of letting up sending other fathers - and other fathers' children - off to die in the various wars we've got on at the minute. So if Dads is to get a sequel - and they would have to rush it out, because it looks increasingly unlikely that Brown is going to get one of his own - perhaps these families might be approached for winsome anecdotes? marina.hyde@theguardian.com",Marina Hyde: There's nothing worse than a politician playing parent,2008-05-02T23:11:18Z,Marina Hyde,politics
"It's the kind of story that, even if you'd been in a coma, would strike you as strange. Miley Cyrus is the 15-year-old star of a Disney show called Hannah Montana, and recently posed for an Annie Leibovitz shoot in Vanity Fair. That's pretty much all you need to know - Vanity Fair is no ordinary magazine, and stars don't ascend into its pages just for being rich and pretty. The interview and/or photos need to have a USP, so if they're a bit older - Teri Hatcher, say - there will be a revelation of a personal nature (child abuse/anorexia), and if they're young enough that they haven't already, they will take their clothes off. There's probably a contract in every agent's office with a list of things you have to hold off revealing until you get the Vanity Fair call (""I'm afraid I have already shown my breasts, but you can put me down for two buttocks and a sugar addiction?""). In fact, very little of Cyrus's actual, you know, apparatus, appeared in the magazine, but the shoot was nevertheless considered racy, because she was wrapped in a sheet. ""Respectable"" people could concentrate on nothing but what might be underneath the sheet. And yet, as Cyrus pointed out at the start of the controversy, yard-for-yard there's a lot more material in a sheet than there is in, say, a dress. Or as she put it: ""I had a big blanket on. And I thought, this looks pretty and really natural. I think it's really artsy."" Of course, if there's one thing you can't get away with in the teeth of a row about propriety, it's appearing not to think you've done anything wrong in the first place. She'd probably have been better off following up on her new badass status and biting the head off a chicken. Fury rained down; former fans were suggesting that communities got together to bonfire her merchandise. And finally, she relented, saying: ""I feel so embarrassed. I never intended for this to happen and I apologise to my fans.""  Never mind what a ludicrous system this is that chooses young women for their sex appeal and then expects them to act as role models for the chastity of the rest of the population. It's the insincerity of everyone concerned that really chokes me. Not one person involved can seriously think Miley Cyrus had any kind of influence over this, or any other, image-building decision. Her career started off in this great cloud of wholesomeness because that's how they always start. To admit to complexity in the feelings of a pre-sexual girl would be to invite a whole world of controversy, and who wants that? That's not the way to shift units of anything. The wholesome bit doesn't, and couldn't ever add up to a whole person, not even a whole 15-year-old. But then the high-voltage sexual phase that follows it, in the marketing curve, is also only a simulacrum of sex. None of it means anything, these girls' outfits - from dungarees, to ""ironic"" school uniform, to prom dresses, to bikinis, to sheets - are all just markers to say ""this is the age-range to which we're now flogging this person, and all this-person-related merchandise"". In 20 years' time, we won't even need hotpants, all these starlets can run naked like pretty fawns, with stickers on their arses saying ""11 and over"", ""not for under-16s"", like films or children's toys.  Naturally, no good comes of the girls caught in the eye of these fake storms. Well, they end up incredibly rich, and also incredibly messed up in the head. But I'm not suggesting a crusade on their behalf. It's not as if they've sold their souls, just their sanity. They can always buy it back. What would be good is some honesty from this business, someone from Vanity Fair, or from Disney, or from Cyrus's own camp, to come out and say, ""Of course it wasn't Miley's idea. Of course it doesn't mean anything. Of course she has nothing to apologise for. What's the matter with you people?""

"Time for a change: one of the great rallying cries in any democracy. Incumbent parties and politicians run out of time. By this criterion next Thursday's London mayoral election should be a formality for the Tories, throwing out the flyblown incumbent of eight years. But against all the odds the polls point to a very close thing - and even a Livingstone victory. The very closeness of the race, whatever the result, indicates a deeper truth. The Conservatives' leads in the opinion polls - from a narrowing 5 per cent reported by ICM last week to an enormous 19 per cent lead by YouGov - are fickle and volatile. The Tories, exemplified by London mayoral candidate Boris Johnson, are finding it much harder than they should to capitalise on Labour's travails. It is the canny, streetwise Livingstone who better reflects the public mood and speaks to Londoners' anxieties than a man straight out of PG Wodehouse. The Tories are still out of sync with the times. Calls for individual self-reliance, a celebration of wealth and robust advocacy of markets don't work any more. What people want is fairness together with less raw capitalism. They want a recovery in civic and social duty. But on these issues Conservatives have nothing coherent to say. To change a party whose core impulses will only move against this makes no sense. The Tories could not and would not deal with the credit crunch; won't make Britain fairer; won't mobilise the resource to repair the parts of our society that don't work; and don't get the aspirations of a generation brought up on social networking sites and instant communications. Hence the febrile poll movements. No love of Labour; no embrace of Toryism. Shadow Chancellor George Osborne, fluent and intelligent, is another prominent Tory who should be scoring more points. The credit crunch should have been a heaven-sent opportunity for effective opposition. The script is easy. The government has been asleep at the wheel. It has indulged a vast increase in credit, and an absurd house price boom, aided and abetted by executives chasing indefensibly high bonuses as a reward for reckless lending. The unregulated City has created a self-made crisis and misery for millions. The government must act. Osborne goes through the motions, but what stymies him is that he is a believer in the very policies and attitudes that have delivered the crisis. It seems a matter of personal incredulity that free markets, in which he has invested so much political capital, deliver irrational credit booms and busts. In his mind, regulation is always the problem not the solution. Public intervention and ownership are always wrong. Thus he consistently opposed the only viable future for Northern Rock (temporary public ownership), and now helps make the mortgage crisis worse by insisting that Britain's fifth largest lender should pull out of the market because it is publicly owned. Mad. Even if he were less wedded to the old-time religion, he would still have his party to contend with, along with a powerful right-wing commentariat who, some honourable exceptions aside, are unreconstructed Thatcherites. Thus, for example, he has to spend precious minutes in interviews trying to pretend that support for the Bank of England's activism (good) is different from central government's activism (bad) in order to keep his critics at bay. Ordinary voters don't understand. Why are politicians splitting hairs to preserve ideological purity? The answer is that for Conservatives, Thatcherism remains totemic - a sweet marriage of core belief, electoral and economic success. But the difference with the late 1970s could not be more marked. Thatcherism may have been ideological, but it was an evident answer to the real issues of the time. Corporatist price and incomes policies had not addressed inflation; public intervention had not lifted economic growth.  Controlling the money supply, deregulating markets, privatising nationalised industries and reducing the power of organised labour would do what the outgoing mainstream consensus could not. They would lower inflation and revive the economy. Moreover, these propositions were underpinned by vibrant new free market economic theorists, almost all American, together with a cultural shift away from post-war collectivism. The sexual and youth revolutions of the 1960s had seeded an individualism that also succoured Thatcherism. The chance to own your council house or even shares had become the new centre of cultural gravity. And to cement it all, the same revolution was going on in the US - offering Thatcher not just well worked-out ideas but, even more importantly, the imprimatur of the hegemonic Western power.  To add to Tory woes, America no longer offers an ideological prop. The American neoconservative movement has split. America's best economists are now preoccupied about the limits of markets. The IMF and World Bank no longer peddle the so-called Washington consensus. Newspaper columns discuss how obscene inequality, not seen since before the Depression, is threatening the American dream. Popular business icons are no longer the masters of Wall Street. The polls indicate even more Democrat gains in the Senate and House. This does not mean a return to the statist corporatism of the pre-Seventies. The debate is more subtle. It is how to humanise capitalism, constrain its worst proclivities and use public power more creatively to get markets to deliver public interest outcomes. For example, a leading industrialist such as Rolls-Royce's Sir John Rose does not call for a 1970s' industrial policy, he calls for an industrial 'route-map' to allow companies such as his to pursue a long-term investment strategy. Today's Tories have no reply - any more than they have about what to do about climate change, the emergence of a super-class or the hardening of social housing estates into quasi-ghettos. Labour's problem is that Gordon Brown's indecisiveness and political misjudgments - over tax, the credit crunch, civil liberties and many more - are because he cannot make the necessary gear shift fast enough even though events and opinion should compel him. If he could make the change, though, he could yet surprise everybody. These are Labour, not Tory, times. The next election remains his to lose.","Will Hutton: Try as he might, the wind is set against George Osborne",2008-04-26T23:20:32Z,Will Hutton,politics
"The American presidential campaign has become a stumble along the Via Dolorosa. As the mob howls from the sidewalk, the candidates seem in a daze, falling to the ground every few steps. Mistakes, gaffes, leaks and ""misspeakings"" form themselves into the Stations of the Cross, gradually defining the contest. Hillary Clinton's stumbles have been, successively, her Bosnian ""sniper fire"" fib, her claims of ""roles"" in Kosovo and Northern Ireland, the Colombian conflict of interest of her sacked aide Mark Penn, and her cringe-making jibe at Barack Obama as being ""not a Muslim, as far as I know"". Obama, ostensibly the smoothest performer imaginable, has been no less prone to mishap. His ""narrative"" has staggered from the ""bone-headed"" acceptance of a land gift from a party donor, to his wife's being ""never proud of my country until now"" and the ""pastor disaster"" of his association with the radical Chicago preacher, Jeremiah Wright. Then last week came the casual reference to the ""bitterness"" of small- town Americans ""taking refuge in guns and religion"", a reference that allegedly cost him dear in Pennsylvania.  John McCain, whose own Via Dolorosa has hardly begun, has had to survive a sweetheart story in the New York Times, mind-numbing mistakes about capital taxes and a reckless claim that the Iranians were ""taking al-Qaida into Iran, training them and sending them back"". This is about the only thing that the (Shia) Iranians are almost certainly not doing in the Sunni parts of Iraq. No story about the campaign fails to mention some or all of these incidents, referred to generically as ""misspeaking"". The campaign has become a composite of them, a positive defined by its negatives.  The reason is not hard to discern. A modern campaign, not just in America, is so fine-tuned, so honed and platitudinised, that mistakes are the only way of bringing it into focus. In the New Yorker, Hendrik Hertzberg describes it as a syndrome. ""While the politician's perfectly functioning brain has dispatched the correct signals, the mouth has somehow received and transmitted them in altered form."" They are thus distanced from the speaker and become nobody's fault, like a child putting its misbehaviour down to genetics. ""She misspoke"" means she lied, but permissibly so.  The word, originating in Chaucer, is traceable to Nixon's ""misspeakings"" to explain away palpable falsities. It is a sort of intellectual halitosis, deplored as another instance of the brainless inadequacy of modern democracy.  I welcome it. A campaign composed of serial course-correction is no bad proxy for modern government, and no bad test of leadership. The mishaps also reveal latent truths. The accusation of ""congenital lying"" has long stuck to the Clintons, and Hillary's misspeakings add substance to the charge. Obama's casual remark about small-town Americans - by implication poor whites - may have been at a private gathering in California, but it displayed an aspect of the man that contains a grain of truth. Behind the down-to-earth Chicago community activist is that most elitist American, the well-heeled and aloof Harvard lawyer.  Candidates customarily declare that a misspeaking has been misreported or misinterpreted, but a clever one turns it to advantage. Criticism of Clinton for the negativity of her attacks on Obama - ""the Clintons will do anything to win"" - is converted into a symbol of herself as a ""fighting underdog"", as ""not a quitter"". Even as she loses on points, she taunts Obama for his inability ""to close this thing down"", to knock her out. It is her strongest suit, even where she has clearly failed to knock him out.  Obama's handling of his membership of Wright's congregation was no less deft. This wild-card champion of black consciousness should have been on the avoid-list from the start. Obama used the Wright affair as occasion for one of his most thoughtful speeches on race. He considered Wright ""not only wrong but divisive"". He carefully refused to disown him (and offend black people) but instead treated him as a biblical text.  Wright's fault, he said, was to identify black people as a static class ""irrevocably bound to a tragic past"". For his part, Obama had ""brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews, uncles, cousins of every race and every hue, scattered across three continents, and for as long as I live I will never forget that in no other country on earth is my story even possible"". Obama pointed out the significance of a black leader demanding that black people stop pleading for handouts from (white) government and ""take full responsibility for our own lives"". What could be more ""conservative""? While the words may have passed over many Americans, the poison was drawn. Exegesis of Obama's speech has been a high point of the campaign and indeed of American race relations. The historian Garry Wills has ranked it with Lincoln's Cooper Union speech in 1860. No great issues divide political tribes in most democracies these days. This is why so many election results are near dead-heats. When citizens are relatively prosperous they do not need politicians to advance their cause. Instead they want their leaders to be icons of the public realm, like them but more so. Hence such apparently idiot polls as: who would you most like to meet in ... a barbecue, elevator, subway? In a moment of revelation, Obama recently remarked on the impossibility of distinguishing candidates by policies and programmes. ""Everybody has got a 10-point plan on everything,"" he said. ""You go to Senator Clinton's website and my website and they look identical. The problem is not the lack of proposals."" The problem was how to break Washington's notorious legislative logjam of lobbies and interest groups - to which, by implication, Clinton was beholden. The campaign comes alive when seen through the prism of a mishap count. There is no debate on the credit crisis and little on the war. Healthcare and terrorism barely feature. But modern political leadership is no longer programme-driven. It is composed of responses to unpredictable crises, to wars, terror attacks, financial crashes and oil-price shocks. The qualities required are those of accident management. The genius of the primary campaign is to test the ability of candidates to respond to such accidents, to explain frequent course corrections and apologise for the gaffes and infelicities inevitable in the age of 24/7 coverage. It is a strength of the drawn-out Democratic primaries that they are testing such ability to destruction. The media has barely started on the Republicans and McCain. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com",Simon Jenkins: The White House race is a catalogue of misspeaking,2008-04-24T23:06:51Z,Simon Jenkins,world
"The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Monday 12 January 2009 The article below cited statistics from a 2003 study which said that the number of rapes increased by 50% and indecent assaults by 57% in the London borough of Camden after four lap dancing venues opened. According to the Lilith Report on Lap Dancing and Striptease in the Borough of Camden the statistics were based on information published by the Metropolitan police relating to the financial years 1998-99 and 2001-02. The Metropolitan police have provided us with the following figures: 72 rapes and 162 indecent assaults in the borough in 1998-99, and 96 rapes and 251 indecent assaults in 2001-02, which corresponds to a 33% increase in rape and a 55% increase in indecent assault.   It's the kind of loophole the sex industry must have been dreaming of: in 2003, when the Licensing Act came into force, lapdancing clubs could suddenly be opened as easily as a karaoke bar or a Starbucks. Previously they needed a special nudity licence. The results are striking - the number of clubs in Britain has doubled, to 300, in just four years. Advocates of these seedy places are always on about no-touching rules, and how stripping just couldn't be more different to prostitution, but the evidence says differently. Research presented at the Kilkenny conference on human trafficking and the sex industry this year found that most women working as prostitutes start off at the legal end of the sex trade, and lapdancing clubs are like market day for traffickers.  Dancers say those no-touching rules are a red herring, since the competition is too intense for such niceties; and furthermore, there is no taboo attached to punters offering money for full sex after one of these ""no-touching"" dances. And the evidence shows an increase in sexual assaults when a lapdancing club opens, affecting both dancers and women who happen to live in the area. In Camden, a report by the Lilith project comparing the three years before and after the opening of four lapdancing clubs found that incidents of rape rose by 50% and sexual assault by 57%. I'm talking in broad brushstrokes, but I think everybody has always known this about these clubs. It doesn't make sense for the legal sex industry to have no interaction with the illegal one. The participants are the same people: you don't get ""nice men"" who are only turned on by legal naked women and have nothing in common with ""nasty men"" who want to go the whole hog. So why did this change in the law slip through, without mention, as if it were the most natural thing in the world? It happened in part, I believe, because the visual language of stripping has been appropriated by mainstream culture. You'll see a lapdance referenced in a music video; you might hear a stripper of global renown - Dita von Teese, for instance - talking about how she wasn't objectified because her act is a work of art; women who are light years away from having to strip for cash might do a pole dancing class for a wacky hen night. I'm not getting po-faced about this. I couldn't give a stuff about middle-class women kidding themselves that pole dancing is a smashing experience. I am simply surprised at what I suspect has happened: that the mainstream cultural usage of stripping as just a way to be a bit saucy has impacted so profoundly on the way we see sexual commerce that the government forgot why it had regulated lapdancing clubs in the first place.  Naturally, the stripping lite you might see on MTV has no more to do with lapdancing than ""heroin chic"" has to do with taking heroin. But these attitudes are never examined because of the way legislation has worked: rather than outlaw strip clubs, it has been traditional in Britain to complicate matters. Ethical debate is politically perilous - you might be wrongfooted into admitting you're against all of it, or conversely that you're in favour of prostitution. Neither position is a vote winner. Indeed, I don't think there exists a rigorous and consistent take on the industry that will win more votes than just staring at your feet and changing the subject. So one of the most ideologically charged matters a government could get involved in - selling sex - becomes a quiet, undiscussed sub-clause in a law about premises and licensing, and the safety of women can be compromised by a decision that passed without remark under the hubbub about 24-hour drinking. Political cowardice is behind this, and when you set that against the courage shown by lapdancers in simply going to work, it's more shaming still.mszoewilliams@yahoo.co.uk",Zoe Williams: Lapdancing's naked truths,2008-04-23T08:43:00Z,Zoe Williams,uk
"And so Brown's calamities continue. Labour's tax rebels have yet to be bought off; post office closures are adding to the doorstep misery; and despite the hint of an upswing, the London mayoral contest remains a nail-biter. When it comes to comparisons with the twilight of the Tory years, overexcited observers flit between Thatcher circa the poll tax and John Major's demise, but their essential point is simple enough: Labour is screwed, Conservative victory at the next election is assured, and the coming weeks will make everything clear. Interestingly, it's not quite working out like that. Look at yesterday's Guardian/ICM poll: Labour's standing up by five points, the Tories down three, their lead reduced from 13 points to a mere five, and Alistair Darling's approval rating six points higher than George Osborne's. Not that one set of numbers says it all, but it surely only highlights the headache that spoils even David Cameron's most triumphal moments: his failure even to begin to match the skyrocketing poll leads that Tony Blair managed in the equivalent phase of the Major period. In among the panicked cacophony emanating from the parliamentary Labour party, the odd considered voice can thus be heard counselling a cagey optimism. To use the Westminster parlance, Cameron has yet to seal the deal with the electorate; indeed, on this evidence, we're yet to see the closure of the opening negotiations. What, then, is going on? Tory sources claim that though the government is in the midst of serial nightmares, now is not quite the time to look for any seismic breakthrough. In keeping with Cameron's emphasis on the ""tortoise"" approach, the party is playing a measured game, focusing on campaigning in the marginals, and approaching the tax rebellion with delicacy. On the latter front, to overplay their hand would be to scare Frank Field's ragtag rebels back towards Brown, so the Tories are stepping back from any hardened proposals of their own, and hoping that a Labour revolt feeds into the narrative of the government's irreversible decline. The script remains the same: to weather blips, keep calm and maintain the run of success that began last autumn. But if not a big poll jump now, then when? Perhaps Cameron and Osborne's debating-pit shrillness - toned down of late, but still there - continues to play badly with large swaths of the public and, on the national stage, the class aspect of the Boris Johnson candidacy really isn't helping. Maybe, notwithstanding the obvious talent of your Michael Goves and William Hagues, the calibre of the Conservative frontbench still speaks volumes; to watch, say, the appearance of the Tory chair, Caroline Spelman, on last week's edition of Question Time was to witness a case study in how confused and limp the supposed new Conservatism can still look. And try this: stepping back from received opinion, perhaps the public hasn't come to quite the swingeing conclusion on the Brown government that so much of the commentariat would like to believe. But there's a bigger strategic argument here. If the essential theme of politics after the long fall of Blair is a massed recoiling from the Westminster ritual, Cameron's big problem is surely his failure to convince enough voters that he offers something different. Just when his interesting early talk about wellbeing might chime with economic conditions, it now seems but a memory. To look at his predicament from a very different angle, plenty of Tories continue to lobby hard for the kind of strident neo-Thatcherism that the post-Blair settlement rules out, claiming that rising popular anxiety demands it. But none of this fits with his current approach: as Brown's woes give Cameron the scent of victory, he emphasises competence and confidence rather than policy oomph, says precious little of consequence, and comes up with a shtick that can sound downright strange. This week, for example, as rumours of a high-profile Labour defection swirled around, he rhapsodised about the underrated talents of such New Labour old-timers as Alan Milburn (""very sensible""), Stephen Byers and that well known public favourite, Andrew Adonis. In his sights, it seemed, was some imagined constituency of disaffected Blair-lovers, though he sounded uncomfortably like the man who so lost his way last year. Heir-to-Blair didn't work then; it surely won't work now. Indeed, to hear him talk like that is to go straight to the malaise that seems to be affecting both Cameron and Brown: an outmoded bedazzlement with the figure whose star began to fall a good half-decade ago, and a consequent failure to deliver any convincing answer to what cutting-edge politics - right or left - might be all about. While I was writing this, I did as the Cameroons do, and went back to an old Blair speech - his last address to a Labour party conference, given in September 2006. Brimming with economic good cheer, it reads like something from another age, though it contains words that still might be re-contextualised to stiffen the spines of those Labour MPs who should take a long, cold look at the opposition and realise that things might not be quite as bleak as they seem: ""If we can't take this lot apart in the next few years we shouldn't be in the business of politics at all."" john.harris@theguardian.com",John Harris: Tories should be making hay but Cameron just looks lost,2008-04-22T23:11:41Z,John Harris,politics

Please don't try to redeem this offer, I am just being supercilious. What do I know of the ways in which one might screw up one's child? Nothing at all.

"Gordon Brown's breakfast meeting with senior bankers yesterday was against a backdrop of the most serious challenge to the financing of the British housing market for more than 30 years. The warning last Friday from the Council of Mortgage Lenders that new mortgage lending in Britain could fall by half in 2008 is unprecedented. If no action is taken urgently to get the market moving, Britain will confront not a necessary and containable downward correction in house prices but a self-feeding house-price meltdown with profound economic consequences. Since the early 1970s, mortgage lending in Britain has grown almost continuously, feeding the growth of home ownership and house prices. There has never been any material setback, except for the period from 1988 to 1991, when mortgage lending and house prices fell back by about 15%. The experience scarred a whole cohort of homeowners. A potential 50% fall in lending compressed into one year and superimposed on house prices that are very much more overvalued in real terms than they were in the late 1980s is the equivalent of a financial tsunami. It is uncharted economic territory. Small wonder that the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has reported the most widespread drop in property values since 1978. Before this threat I would expect leadership, urgency and action from the government. Instead Sir James Crosby, the former chief executive of HBOS, has been invited to undertake an emergency review of the mortgage market, reporting leisurely in the autumn - by when the tsunami will have hit us. There are breakfasts with senior bankers, and the Bank of England is holding a parallel series of amiable meetings while periodically injecting some billions of liquidity as a palliative for the distressed interbank market. An incredible spectacle. The problem is that Brown has bought the conservative argument that the only source of economic instability is the government, whose spending and borrowing must be disciplined. Hence prudence; no boom and bust and all that. Meanwhile, the private sector can be relied on to arrive at optimal economic outcomes because it is private and markets unfailingly work well. The doubling of mortgage lending in five years and its subsequent halving should disabuse him, but he and his advisers seem incapable of changing course - even if recent remarks by the chancellor show that he, at least, realises how serious the crisis might become. What is required is nothing less than a paradigm shift in policy. The Bank of England must immediately be given the same freedom as the US Federal Reserve to set interest rates, with an eye on growth as well as inflation. Northern Rock is in public ownership; instead of withdrawing from the mortgage market because it might otherwise offend commercial banks, it should be required to expand its lending. Commercial banks that object should be politely ignored. The Bank of England must immediately begin lending against mortgage-backed assets that the commercial banks bring to its discount window. Public banks, along the lines of the US's Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, need to be created to trigger the mortgage market into action.  There should be quid pro quo for all of this. More appropriate pay for bankers. More willingness to support long-term lending to business and community projects. But most of all there must be an acceptance that banks cannot turn on and off credit on this scale, and that avoidance in future requires tight regulation. We need a New Deal with the City - not chummy breakfasts. · Will Hutton is chief executive of the Work Foundation will.hutton@observer.co.uk",Will Hutton: Smell the coffee,2008-04-15T23:45:01Z,Will Hutton,politics
"The baleful 'For Sale' signs do not carry a health warning, but they should. House prices can go down as well as up. And however smart you are, the impact is universal, despite everybody hoping that somehow, someone else will suffer the pain.  Last week, the reality began to sink in. The Halifax reported a 2.5 per cent monthly fall in house prices, the biggest since 1992. It is behind the curve. Prices are already 10 per cent down in most parts of the country; even the London market, which is supposedly holding up, is in trouble. I know of prices that have fallen by 25 per cent. The problem is that market interdependency is being undermined; the seller of the £1m house depends upon the buyer selling his or her £700,000 house and so on down to the first-time buyer. If any part of the chain is hit by the new tight terms of credit, the deals collapse. And the number of sales is plunging.  The blight hits everyone. The most tragic are those whose houses are repossessed, but most of the suffering is hidden. People are trapped and have to put their lives on hold because they cannot move because the housing market is seizing up: the newly retired couple who plan to move out to the country; the woman who wants to move closer to her new job; the family that wants to be nearer a school. Everybody has to abandon or defer their plans. Houses have become a form of economic currency; suddenly, it has been withdrawn with implications that are rippling across our entire society. Economists say that a 'correction' in the British housing market is necessary and will make housing more affordable. They are right. But this correction threatens to go beyond a necessary price adjustment which the Prime Minister last week described as 'containable'. The Council of Mortgage Lenders warned on Friday that new mortgage lending could halve in 2008 from last year's figure, a process that is already evident with mortgage approvals down by a third. If this process is uninterrupted, the localised 25 per cent price falls will become generalised. The IMF believes that prices are 27 per cent too high; the downward correction could easily overshoot. Which is why I find the current policy stasis so perplexing. When Chancellor Alistair Darling has the political cover of other finance ministers, as in the G7 meetings in Washington, he talks of the urgent need for action against a financial shock that is the worst since the Great Depression. Fine. Yet what emerged in Washington was shutting the stable door after the financial horse had bolted - calls for early-warning systems, better regulation and sounder lending policy in the future - while doing next to nothing to address the problems in the here and now. Britain has to take substantive additional action, whether there is wider political cover or not. The Chancellor should take a closer look at the 1930s. The heart of Roosevelt's New Deal was not public works or programmes for the unemployed, significant though both of these were. It was the root-and-branch reconstruction of an American financial system that, like ours today, had run amok in a laissez-faire, deregulated free-for-all. The Federal Reserve was created, public banks were launched to lend to homeowners, refinance mortgages and lend to industry and investment banks and commercial banks were legally separated. Neither do you need to go back to the 1930s. When the Swedish, Finnish and Norwegian financial systems got into trouble in the early 1990s because they had lent too much too recklessly after deregulation, their governments did exactly what Roosevelt had done. They reconstructed their systems, again using public funds. Subsequent Nordic economic success, as in America after 1933, was because finance was organised and regulated to serve business and homeowners. Britain is in an analogous position. If house prices were to fall by a generalised 25 per cent over the next couple of years, there would be proper fears about the solvency of the banking system. Without action on a grand scale, we would face a credit crunch-induced recession. What amazes me is that there is not more popular outcry, more politicians willing to speak out and more examination of how this potential debacle could be averted. This is not a crisis caused by government excess, a run on the pound or high interest rates. It has been gifted us by a reckless financial system that has run itself more or less as a gigantic pyramid selling scheme for the past few years in the quest for vast personal bonuses.  Between 2004 and 2007, bank lending rose 200 per cent while bank capital went up only 20 per cent. Lending had been manufactured as the byproduct of a kind of gigantic financial chain letter, with ignorant bankers boasting that they had hit upon the alchemy of being able to lend without having either capital or any deposits - and at no risk. Meanwhile, bonuses of millions became routine. Now we are living with the results. Pyramid selling is illegal; so should the pyramid construction of bank balance sheets. It is illegal to pay accountants to rig reports and accounts. It should be similarly illegal to pay credit-rating agencies to assess your creditworthiness. Stealing from shareholders is illegal. Huge bonuses as a reward for reckless lending are tantamount to theft. Governments need to get credit flows moving again through injections of capital, liquidity, regulation and the resetting of bankers' remuneration. They should not worry for a second about the financial community's concerns that this may constrain their freedoms in future. Instead, some should be taken aside for police questioning. In Britain, Vincent Cable's efforts on Northern Rock excepted, no politician has risen to the occasion. Even the sainted Cable has not developed solid proposals for the necessary reconstruction of the system. While Barack Obama has made well-argued, passionate speeches in the great tradition, insisting that there be reciprocal obligations placed upon Wall Street in return for government support and proposing a web of new institutions and initiatives to deal with everything from rising repossessions to the fall away in credit for American business, in Britain silence reigns.  For social democrat politicians, as Gordon Brown and Darling still purport to be, this should be a golden opportunity. They should not hesitate and set out to reconstruct the British financial system around solid progressive values. Credit needs to flow again. We cannot live in a society where the flow of credit doubles then halves almost from year to year. What Obama can only propose in America is possible in Britain. And by doing this, the government would be relaunched. It would show purpose, expose the Conservatives as bankers' narks - and save the British middle class from a house price disaster. All that is required is what the government lacks - conviction.",Will Hutton: Government fiddles while the price of houses burns,2008-04-12T23:08:50Z,Will Hutton,politics
"At last, a solution to all this bourgeois anxiety about the environmental impact of travel: class tourism. You don't have to leave the house and you always end up feeling better about yourself. It has certainly seemed a viable alternative in recent weeks, as people have been able to observe the denizens of the West Yorkshire estate on which Shannon Matthews lived, and apply all sorts of labels - the most popular referencing Shameless, the television series by the award-winning writer Paul Abbott set on a fictional Manchester estate.  To read the papers since the arrest of Shannon's mother, Karen, has been to see Britain as a nation of Gillian McKeiths - completely ill-qualified to pass judgment, but keen to shriek in horror at how these people do live.  Yet before we begin picking through Fleet Street's effluent, it is worth revisiting Abbott's own words on his creation. ""I hung on to the title Shameless for its irony, the kind of accusation outsiders would have chucked at my family back in the 70s,"" he explained a few years ago. ""To observers, we were a chaotic bunch of kids trying to bring ourselves up after both parents had walked. We were a mess. But how were we to know that? Ignorance being bliss was our most treasured human asset. We were loud, aggressive, primitive and anarchic. But I never once recall us feeling shameless."" Apparently without irony, though, Abbott is now tacitly accused of glorifying the background from which he emerged to write such brilliant dramas. We'll take your State of Play and your Cracker, the Daily Mail seems to say, but this one only leads to trouble. His crime appears to have been to humanise these strange creatures, because in our fantastically nuanced media culture, humanising people is indistinguishable from ""legitimising"" everything they do.  There are far better approaches. Indeed, the Sun has made such enchantingly sincere efforts to understand what I suppose they'd call ""these sort of people"" or - if in more reflective mood - ""the readers"". In recent years, the paper has held awaydays for its senior staff in caravan parks and holiday camps, the better to observe this intriguing species. The highlight of one such jolly was a ""chav knees-up"", to which staff were ordered to come in ""chav gear"". Heartbreakingly, all this method acting appears to have been for naught. This week the paper appeared to be on the verge of calling for smelling salts as it noted that some residents of the Moorside estate had been seen wearing pyjamas to the corner shop. When I was growing up, I recall several mothers who would think nothing of being in their pyjamas while dropping children at school. They were regarded as rather bohemian - presumably because they were the upper end of middle class. They had nicer pyjamas. It's a fine line between English eccentric and scum, isn't it? One writers' cliche has it that ""cancer is no respecter of class or wealth"" - and you wouldn't believe it, but it emerged as my classmates and I grew up that all sorts of other horrors and abuses aren't, either.  We were not better people than those on the Moorside. The only difference was more money and better opportunities - and there's nothing so self-perpetuating as those. Nothing, perhaps, except the sense that you're scum because everyone likes to tell you so. And more than any other paper, the Sun has seemed bent on demonising Moorside. A roadsweeper was quoted as saying it was ""like Beirut, only worse"" - a verdict so obviously inaccurate that the paper should no more have printed it than it would a four-letter-strewn outburst about Muslims or Rupert Murdoch. ""The ... estate is a real-life version of the smash hit Channel 4 show Shameless,"" began another report, ""but local families refuse to admit it."" Several local families were rather ungrateful to be classified thus. ""I've let them have a pee in my bathroom,"" one affronted woman told the Guardian, ""while they've been sitting out there for hours."" That's Her Majesty's Press for you. No class.  It all felt like something of a missed opportunity. The Sun columnist Jon Gaunt barely files an item without bemoaning the fact that ""the white working class"" in this country ""have no voice"". Yet Gaunty appeared to want no part of this one. Presumably the white working class people of the Moorside are not the white working class he is talking about. In the interests of accuracy, though, a chief inspector involved in the investigation stated: ""I've never come across a community so committed to helping police."" So if you spot a white working class person obstructing police inquiries, you may logically assume they're one of Gaunty's. Unfortunately, solutions to the problems seemed rather vague. Nostalgia was a popular one. Sort of ""remember how nice and proud people used to be even though they had no shoes?"" In a rather more earthbound piece, this newspaper noted that the Moorside had been given £4m in regeneration funds in the past three years. To put that into perspective, it was announced this week that the Olympic aquatic centre, which Tessa Jowell swore blind would cost £75m, is currently coming in at £242m. So the estate has basically been given the equivalent of half a changing room and a couple of verruca socks. Still, Beirut wasn't built in a day. And the good news for class tourists yearning for their own bed is that the bulk of the media will now move on, until the trial that is, so it won't be necessary to think about such horrors any more.

"What a mess. On Tuesday, The Daily Telegraph ran a soap-operatic comment piece claiming that the cabinet was in a state of near meltdown. For some reason, it's since disappeared from their website, but all kinds of media outlets took the baton and ran with it. For the time being, a government in disarray and the leadership ambitions of Brown's rivals are the big political stories - have a look, for example, at this bit of tomfoolery from today's Sun - and there's an inevitable whiff of the dread days of the John Major government. Meanwhile, Brown continues to make his life far more difficult than it need be. Even if his announcement that he wouldn't be attending the Olympics' opening ceremony was in line with long-standing plans, the fact that it took so long to make things clear speaks of a ridiculously slipshod approach to PR. Given the prime minister's plans to show up at the closing ceremony, his actions now look superficially of a piece with that infamous Brownian bit of doublethink whereby he signed the Lisbon treaty, but not in the company of the EU's other leaders (and, come to think of it, the recent occasion when he allowed the Olympic torch into Downing Street but apparently made a point of not touching it). Here, it seems, is the point at which the personal becomes political, and Brown plays up to the caricature of the dithering nailbiter - the man who, to quote his old Blairite enemies, remains psychologically flawed. It's some token of Brown's problems that unpicking his current crisis and applying an overarching narrative can look almost impossible, but let's at least try. At the start of his premiership, he made the right noises about rising insecurity and some parts of the Blair inheritance that had started to turn toxic, as evidenced by the speech he made in July 2007 at Labour's special leadership conference in Manchester. To quote the following morning's Guardian leader, Labour was offered the prospect of ""summoning up what its new leader called 'the better angels of our nature', a moral collectivism that stands in contrast to the Conservative belief in individual improvement."" There were the first of many references to the need to ""change to meet new needs"", and ""the new insecurities people feel"". These, given his pledge to put housing at the centre of his government's work and such symbolic moves as the cancellation of Manchester's supercasino, seemed to chime with the modest proposals for a revival of Labour's social-democratic soul that Brown appeared to have made circa 2003-4. In the context of the credit crunch and economic downturn, had he held his nerve and stuck to that script, his tone might have suited these increasingly anxious times. Instead, his supposed moral compass seemed to have been mislaid after a couple of months, and the talk about insecurity was all but dropped in favour of borderline gobbledegook (""the age of ambition"", anyone?). Worse, he fudged the big debates that Labour needed to settle - chiefly, the prospects for the Blairite marketisation of the public services - and the great political illness that is initiativitis set in, made worse by the fact that so much of what's been said has had a tone of misplaced faux-gravitas. As Julian Glover says in today's Guardian comment pages, Brown seems to have ""tangled himself up in a knot of big ideas and long-term purposes, to the extent that nothing he says seems real."" There's no great delight in writing any of this, not least because Brown's increasing travails benefit both the Tories and the hardcore Blairite ultras who'd like to snuff out the last residues of the party's essential values. But still: for anyone who knows that even a chaotic, compromised Brown government is infinitely preferable to the decisive advent of Cameronism and wants it to it somehow realign itself, there are now big problems. Such is the sense of hopeless drift surrounding the government that exhortations to pull things together and change tack are starting to look almost delusional. Rory Bremner recently suggested that watching Brown's progress was ""like having an uncle who's been building something in the shed at the bottom of the garden for 10 years ... you look through the window and there's nothing there."" All things considered, it's very hard to argue with that. And so the malaise deepens and the noise around government grows ever more rancorous. As one Labour MP said to me this morning with a truly mirthless laugh, things can only get bitter.",The Gordian knot,2008-04-10T17:30:00Z,John Harris,politics
"A London firm has designed a bulletproof hoodie. It's £300, which seems a phenomenal amount, and I can't see how it would be effective, since my experience of a sweatshirt with a hood is that it's a roomy, shapeless thing, and if a draught can whistle through, then so surely can a bullet. But never mind that, concentrate for a second on the emotional pull this garment has.  It started off as the sartorial signature of the young criminal. The term hoodie initially seemed racist to me, a way of saying ""a group of young black guys"", without actually calling anyone black, and nobody could point it out, because the first person to say the racist connection would be the first person who made it. It never became necessary to protest over this sleight of hand, however, since the criminal connotation of the look was immediately subverted by that very association - all young people, of all races, of all classes, anyone under 25 who wanted to look a bit downtown, started dressing in this way.  Hoodie activity hereafter came in waves. Bluewater banned them; the Scottish youth parliament voted whether or not they were antisocial, by wearing hoods up or down. A tabloid newspaper sent a goodie in a hoodie to a mall, to be kind to people. David Cameron's policy on social disenfranchisement boiled down to ""hug a hoodie"".  Everyone knows what a gang of hoodies means - they know it isn't a bunch of girls on the way to the gym, even though they'd be as likely to wear them as anyone else would; they know it doesn't mean whey-faced middle-class kids travelling in twos. It's a universal uniform of youth, really, and yet rhetorically, it means ""any group a passer-by might find threatening ... What? I didn't say poor, or black, or young, or even male! I just said hoodie!"" So it's bogus. I'm amazed anyone with even a slight delinquent tendency would dignify the mainstream by wearing the things. I'm more surprised still that there would be a market for bullet-proof ones, and surprised also that Mothers Against Murder and Aggression would worry about it, apart from the fact that they're mothers, so they'll worry about anything. Lyn Costello, the group's founder, said, ""I don't think it helps. It spreads the fear factor and makes teenagers think they are invincible ... we want to encourage them away from a life of violence, not towards it.""  Of course it's a mug's game trying to persuade a pressure group made up of mothers - many of whom will have experienced of tragedy - to stop overreacting. But for everybody else, it's worth recapping how this cultural moment, where Dyneema - the bullet-proof material - was fashioned into sportswear, came about.  If the term ""hoodies"" was originally used as a way to be racist without having to appear it, that delicate cowardice left ambiguity rippling through any further discussion. So, when a shopping centre bans hoodies, who exactly are they closing their doors to? What does antisocial behaviour mean when it can be inferred from your wardrobe? Does that make goths antisocial as well? Which hoodies, precisely, would Cameron have us hug? Any hood, or just the ones we decide pose a threat of criminality, in which case, shouldn't we be interrogating our own assumptions? No, interrogation is the last thing we want, because prejudices abound here that are less troubling when left unspoken. But the result is that this shapeless garment has come to symbolise a sense of the mostly imagined threat posed by youth in general, and the advent of a £300 hoodie that combines that with bulletproof material is mainly metaphorical. It's no big deal, in other words. Who's going to buy one? Apart from Harriet Harman? mszoewilliams@yahoo.co.uk",Zoe Williams: Bulletproof but loaded,2008-04-08T23:13:46Z,Zoe Williams,uk
"The British troops encamped outside Basra resemble Davy Crockett's colleagues in the Alamo. Nobody will come to their rescue. Their position is hopeless. They cannot win. They cannot escape. Their boss, the defence secretary Des Browne, has emphasised their political entombment by reneging on Gordon Brown's pledge to reduce their numbers by a half this spring. The American general, David Petraeus, yesterday said the same of his troops. He wants 140,000 of them to remain at the end of the current surge, dashing hopes that their numbers might come down. The occupation of Iraq is now officially indefinite. Too many politicians have too much to lose by contemplating retreat. Reports from Iraq indicate that the military operations of the past two weeks in Basra and Baghdad were treated by the Americans (or at least by the vice-president, Dick Cheney, who visited Baghdad last month) as a milestone in the occupation of Iraq. Coalition spokesmen were to declare themselves in the dark, indicating Iraq's ability to look after itself and thus vindicating the 2006 surge policy.  The military objective of the policy was clear. The ""awakening"" movement divided the Sunnis into good guys and bad guys and has largely worked, backing to the hilt any gunmen likely to hold al-Qaida influence in check. A policy of ghetto-isation in Baghdad has kept Sunnis and Shias apart and reduced the body count.  Phase two was aimed at the Shias. The prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, was told to show his ability to end the emerging civil war within the Shia community. On the one side were the trained Mahdist irregulars of Moqtada al-Sadr, on the other a ramshackle alliance of an unreliable army, a corrupt police and various Badr militias loyal to the moderate Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq. If Maliki could not put an end to Sadr's chaotic insurrection, progress in Iraq would be inconceivable.  The assault on Sadr's forces was double-pronged, intended to end their presence in Basra since the British withdrawal, and to suppress their stronghold of Sadr City in Baghdad. Maliki showed considerable bravery in going to Basra two weeks ago to oversee the assault of his troops on the rebels. But the operation failed, leaving some 500 dead and only an agreed ceasefire. British forces on the outskirts of Basra offered the Iraqis surveillance, some occasional shelling and rescue snatch squads, but critically they did not intervene sufficiently to ensure victory for Maliki. While this proved that Maliki's forces could not handle Basra unaided, the value of such proof is moot. Britain can hardly now re-assert authority over Basra when Maliki has failed. Yet if Britain remains aloof during such critical encounters, why be in Iraq at all?  The operation in Sadr City has been different. With American armour fully deployed, the sprawling settlement has been subjected to another Falluja, with tanks and bombers seeking to terrify the indigenous population into turning against Moqtada. Here sheer firepower could win the day. The Shia religious leadership of Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani is being consulted on a theocratic ceasefire, to stop a Shia civil war - but as of yesterday there was no sign of this.  As Petraeus told Congress yesterday, the surge has been a partial success in that crudest of measures: body count. But what next? Maliki has shown that he still cannot command authority in Iraq's two biggest cities without calling on foreign firepower. Sunni warlords have been armed, ghettos created and the Mahdists possibly silenced for the time being. But these are sticking-plaster jobs. They have done nothing to bring Iraq's communities together in some sort of political concord. It has rather realigned them for future conflict. Maliki's survival may be crucial to Iraq's stability, and the surge important to that extent. But as so often with military operations there has been no political follow-through. Iraq has not found a leader remotely capable of ruling his country autonomously. While the Sunnis may rest content for the time being in their partitioned statelet, that does not apply to the Shias. Here Sadr will present a menace to Maliki as long as the foreign occupation is in place, and certainly given this week's proposal to make it indefinite. Moqtada can turn his gunmen on and off at will.  In Vietnam, American military mythology holds that if only the army had been more steadfast in opposing the Tet offensive, it could have won the war. It was ""lack of will"" at home that led to eventual defeat. Hence there should be no lack of will in Iraq, or America's friends will fall before an army of Iranian imams.  There is no way of sustaining a client who no longer exists except by virtue of being sustained. The past fortnight has shown conclusively that the Maliki government is wholly dependent on America. The surge was a military tactic, not a strategy. It was supposed, in that old cliche, to ""supply politics with a breathing space"". But hundreds have continued to die, and Iraq's politics remain rooted in the embattled culture of the green zone. The truth is that there will be no peace within the Shia regions, no peace between Sunnis and Shias, and no resolution of the issues dividing Arabs and Kurds until the occupation is over. The occupation freezes politics. All else is tinkering.  It is a truism that somewhere between the government, the Mahdists, the Badr brigades, the army, the police and the Sunni warlords an understanding will one day be reached. When that will be depends on the length of the occupation. Departure was meant to be after six months and has been postponed five years, while western strategists test to destruction their belief in military conquest as their preferred route to nation-building.  The surge sheds no light on this route. Iraq remains the most wretched country in Asia, its children dying youngest, its minorities most terrorised, its infrastructure most wrecked. Politics is in suspense, and the middle classes in exile or living in perpetual fear of death. The claim that America and Britain, who created this mess, can best serve it by continuing to hang around, bombing and shooting, is laughable. Maliki may be the west's baby, and leaving him on the bare mountain may be harsh. But tough love is long overdue. The new Iraq, whatever that may be, has not seen an end to the beginning of its misery, let alone a beginning to the end. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com",Simon Jenkins: The occupation has frozen Iraq.

"For a long while, predating the day Gordon Brown became prime minister, those who want to support the Labour government have yearned for a clear dividing line with the Conservatives. Well, now they have one. Last week Ed Balls, the secretary of state for children, schools and families, published the results of his department's inquiry into violations of the school admissions code. It found that one in six schools under review was breaking the rules on how it picked its pupils, either by asking questions it shouldn't ask - inquiring into the marital status of parents, for example; giving priority to those who could show, say, that a grandparent once went to the school; or, most egregiously, demanding would-be parents hand over a ""voluntary contribution"" that sounded an awful lot like fees. Most of the offenders were faith schools.  What was the response to this exposé of institutional unfairness, to this naming and shaming of public bodies that take taxpayers' money yet break rules enshrined in law? Was Balls applauded for insisting that the playing field should be level, with every child given a fair shot at entry, regardless of their parents' income or how many years their family had lived in the area? He was not. Instead he was subjected to a lacerating assault from the Conservatives, sustained by their allies in the right-leaning press. Balls has been branded a Stalinist engaged in class warfare, an old Labour zealot hellbent on dragging down the good to the level of the bad, so that all wallow in the same equality of misery. His motive could only be low politics, pandering to the Labour backbenchers who will choose the party's next leader - because Balls has clearly decided Brown is destined for defeat.  You get the idea. Put to one side the curious sight of the Tory right screaming blue murder because a Labour politician has the temerity to suggest the law of the land be enforced. Concentrate instead on the heart of the matter. Ed Balls was not criticising these schools because they are good or because they are religious, but because their rules of entry are unfair. Faith groups themselves describe Balls as ""very supportive""; only a few months back he was taking heat on those same Labour benches for being too friendly to the religious sector. The only issue is fairness. On this simple point, the Tory chorus of denunciation has no response. They cannot defend the unfairness of putting kids whose grandpa was an old boy at the head of the queue, because they know that's a covert way of ensuring a once-white school stays white. And they can't defend probing into parental background and marital status because they know that is the time-honoured way of screening out ""the wrong sort"". They know that these dodges are not mere technicalities and oversights, they are backdoor forms of discrimination by race and class.  What it amounts to, then, is nothing more than an affluent cry of ""Hands off our privileges"". A precis of the columns that have appeared slamming Balls would go as follows: ""Listen, chum, people like us only stay in the state sector because we know we can play the system. You start cracking down on that, you start closing the loopholes that have kept well-heeled, middle-class schools well heeled and middle class and we'll be off to the fee-paying sector before you can say Eton and Harrow. Now, why not be a good little Labour minister and spend your time on those nasty failing schools in the inner city - and leave our schools for us."" Of course, they can't put it quite like that. So they throw up half a dozen smokescreens behind which they can pose as principled. First, they say this was a deliberate, calculated attack. In fact, departmental officials, not ministers, chose the three areas under review - Manchester, Northamptonshire and the London borough of Barnet - and, I'm told, ministers were ""taken aback"" by the results. They had no idea the pattern of violations would be so widespread. It wasn't only faith schools that were at fault, but the fact that lots were is not an argument for turning a blind eye - but rather an argument for those schools to follow the rules.  Which many in the religious communities themselves want. Church leaders privately admit their discomfort at the bad name their schools have acquired as havens for sharp-elbowed middle-class parents; they have not forgotten that their founding purpose was to teach the disadvantaged. A fair admissions code is not a stick to beat them with, but a tool they can use.  A similar dynamic is at work in the Jewish community. It's true that some feel singled out by last week's review: they ask why the department just happened to pick two areas, Manchester and Barnet, with such a high concentration of Jewish schools, given that there are only 39 such schools in the whole country. (When the schools minister Jim Knight meets Jewish headteachers tomorrow, he'll have his work cut out explaining that this was the random act of unbiased civil servants.) Nevertheless, there's a lot of guff in the air that needs to be cleared. The Tories and their friends claim that the ""voluntary contributions"" sought by Jewish schools are purely for the purposes of security. It's quite true that Jewish schools do have to protect themselves from the rising threat of antisemitic attack - a fact that horrified at least one Labour MP when she discovered it. She was appalled that some children in this country are ushered into classes under guard simply because they are Jews. But security costs are only a small fraction of the contributions sought from parents: the bulk of the cash is for religious studies. In other words, invoking security is a form of guilt-tripping, to make Balls look either insensitive or worse, with little connection to reality.  In fact, last week's study was pointing at an uncomfortable truth. There are some Jewish (and Christian) schools that do indeed ask applicants whether they will pay a voluntary contribution: would-be parents are left in no doubt as to the correct answer. I spoke to one mother on a modest income who told me the school's constant demand for the voluntary sum ""verges on harassment"". The Board of Deputies of British Jews told me yesterday that this had been ""an issue for years"" in the community; those schools that make payment a condition of entry are regularly excoriated in the pages of the Jewish Chronicle. They got there before Ed Balls did.  There is a way the government could blunt some of this criticism. It could announce that it is unjust that schools vulnerable to racist attack have to pay to protect themselves out of parents' own pockets - and that from now on security costs will be met by public funds. Not just capital expenses, but the day-to-day running costs. That will be right in itself and will rob critics of one of their more emotive arguments. More ambitiously, it could address the greatest, albeit legal, form of economic discrimination in education: the catchment area, which awards places to those kids whose parents can afford the house price premium that comes with proximity to a successful school. In the meantime, Balls should stand firm. It is not a shift to the left to insist that entry to schools be fair. On the contrary, it is a lurch to the right to argue otherwise, by defending rule-bending for the lucky few. freedland@theguardian.com",Jonathan Freedland: It is not a shift to the left to insist  that entry to schools should be fair,2008-04-08T23:13:45Z,Jonathan Freedland,politics
"In the end, it was the pictures of Carla Bruni photogenically snogging President Sarkozy on a boat on the River Thames, during their state visit, that made me wish they'd both just clear off back to France, Ms Bruni presumably bobbing gently homewards on a sea of male British drool.  It was a public display of affection too far surely, even for their brand of Je t'aime politics? We'd already had Sarkozy lavishing praise on Britain - our courage, our dynamism, all that stuff in the war; the newly prim Bruni smiling demurely, dressed in a Dior suit and pillbox hat, like Jackie O seconds after being body snatched by the Stepford Wives. And from the Sarkozys' point of view, it went splendidly - they had come to Britain for 'PR rehab' and had emerged triumphant, bar the odd upsetting close-up of stack heels. Then the kiss and suddenly the Sarkozys started to remind one of those racy foreign exchange students who come over when you're 14 and make it clear they have 'experience'. This time, though, they had an entire nation in their sights.  There we were, Britain, the blushing virgin lover, overimpressed, clammy palmed, as sexy brutish France pushed us against the wall, promising eternal l'amour, all the time trying to shove its tongue down our collective throat. The thrill of it; when had we last been so ravished? Carla, especially, so chic in her little Dior suit, does it have to be just a one-night stand? Indeed, in sheer PR terms, you've got to ask yourself - when did Britain become such an easy lay?  This is not intended as an attack on Carla, though if it were, there would be no shortage of ammunition. She's a supermodel turned folk singer (donnez moi strength!); she has said excruciating man-pleasing things in the past such as: 'Monogamy bores me'; she has slept with Eric Clapton, Mick Jagger and Donald Trump. Is it really necessary to go on?  Despite this, I would have loved to have got hold of that full-frontal nude portrait put up for auction on the eve of the state visit by Christie's, and splashed all over the newspapers, and given it to Carla to burn. Gorgeous though she looked, what was this except a big, boorish shout of 'keep the bitch in her place'? It's as if, even today, a woman with a past with a capital P scares us and we prefer our First Ladies to be outlines waiting to be coloured in by their powerful husbands.  However, ultimately, it wasn't her nudity in the past that was the issue, it was the Sarkozys' naked ambition in the present, which was seemingly to be crowned as the hot new couple on the international political stage, the couple who make all other political couples look dusty, passionless and redundant. And correspondingly their politics, too, even their countries.  Indeed, was it inadvertent or was there a bizarre whiff of quasi-sexual competitiveness from the Sarkozys towards the Browns, a preening display of potency? Whether Carla was sashaying into Sarah's charity lunch or Sarkozy was 'playing football' with Brown at Arsenal's stadium (both men coming across like two girls desperate not to get their petticoats dirty), it seemed palpable; the none too subtle one-upmanship from the French camp. The whole event had the air of a quiet, serious country couple making the mistake of inviting a glamorous, intimidating couple over for a hellish weekend of nonstop patronising, the story of the town mouse and the country mouse as reinterpreted for the international political stage. However, for some of us, if the idea was to make the Browns, and by association Britain and its politics, look a bit passionless and lacking, it backfired. No offence meant, but the last thing I ever want to see is the Browns playing tonsil tennis on a boat on the Thames. Or anywhere. To me, this doesn't say 'virile and go-getting', it says 'midlife crisis alert, get him away from the button'.  Admittedly, it was all very diverting and it was sweet to see how gallantly British men rushed to welcome Madame Sarkozy and her interesting views on monogamy. Ultimately though, the whole try-hard thing with the Sarkozys left one with a huge appreciation for the Browns. In fact, I'd like to use this column to make an apology: I interviewed Gordon once and left whingeing that he was serious and dull. I'd like to change my mind. Like surgeons and airline pilots, you don't want your world leaders to be too exciting or, God forbid, surprising - it's reassuring that they're serious and dull. Indeed, although one feels this country was too easily seduced by the Carla-Nicolas roadshow, and should maybe have felt affronted by the way they made British politics look passionless by comparison, perhaps in the end, we should just feel relieved. Number one but still in the ghetto Hurrah for Estelle, currently at number one in the charts, for highlighting how most 'black soul' singers in the UK (Joss, Duffy, Adele) are white.  As Estelle could tell you, the music business genuinely is 'colour-blind', but only one way, such as when it wants white people to hijack (whoops, sorry, sing) black music.  The public isn't much better. The NME is constantly harangued for not featuring black cover stars, but when I was there, every time they were put on, sales plummeted.  No coincidence then that Estelle prospered after moving Stateside, or that Simon Cowell rushed over Leona Lewis (now US number one). How proud must we be that, musically speaking, Britain is now the true 'race ghetto'. You owe me 300 quid for that advice, Dr Wakefield Andrew Wakefield, the doctor who first published the idea of a link between the MMR vaccine and autism, causing panic and a plunge in vaccination rates, is currently undergoing a General Medical Council disciplinary hearing. Along with two other doctors, he is charged with serious professional misconduct and could be struck off. In turn, Wakefield argues that the possibility of a link 'merited attention'.  The case is continuing, but it seems hard to believe that Wakefield, now working in Texas, acted maliciously, that he didn't genuinely believe he had unearthed a Thalidomide-style medical scandal.  On the other hand, it's hard to explain to non-parents just how much havoc Wakefield caused with his 'findings'. For a start, he owes me a few hundred quid. Like many parents of young children at the time, we dithered and fretted, but finally decided to pay for single vaccines privately. Which all sounds very la-di-da until you hear what this involved.  Single jab vaccines were (still are) completely unregulated. It was not possible to buy them from the NHS, so one had to trawl the internet. In the end, the person who injected my daughter sat in an office rented for the morning, with an open suitcase full of vaccine. As he plunged the needle into her little arm, I felt sick - this so-called vaccine could be anything.  Such was the hysteria of the times that we just accepted the unsettling 'back of a lorry' feel to the situation, though since then, the mood seems to have changed. Most parents I speak to go straight for the triple vaccine. Worryingly, many others opt not to have their children vaccinated at all, which, in herd-immunity terms, is a disaster. Measles can kill - I dread the day there is an epidemic, the news that a child has died.  One cannot believe that Wakefield meant any harm. One also sympathises with those parents of autistic children, who grab at anything that could illuminate the darkness surrounding their child's condition. However, for a while back there, what was happening around MMR felt like urban voodoo, with snake-oil merchants seizing the opportunity to exploit gullible, panicking parents (guilty). My daughter is having her follow-up booster in the triple vaccine form, but I have a feeling that this mess isn't over yet.  Time for a pregnant pause for thought Is the 'pregnant man' picture of transgender male Thomas Beattie a hoax? Beattie is due to break media silence on April Fool's Day, so draw your own conclusions.  Truth or a hoax, it's a great metaphor for the way men keep butting in on pregnancy. Pregnant women come under constant criticism: too old, young, single, poor, employed. How long before too female? Is it just that women simply can't be trusted with the Big P any more? Certainly, the times, they are a-changing. Time was, a celebrated poster of a preggers man in a cardi aimed to inspire male empathy.

"Britain does fiascos well and by any measure, the opening of BA's £4.3bn Terminal 5 was a corker. The plunge from the pomp of the official opening by the Queen on 14 March to BA chief executive Willy Walsh finding his job on the line after more than 200 cancelled flights has been dramatic. This is no longer about 'teething problems', it raises fundamental questions about the private sector's capabilities, values and priorities. On the morning of Day One, Walsh was smiling, welcoming the first passengers to his wonderful new terminal. The website assured readers that Terminal 5's baggage-handling system 'will move your bags through the airport faster than you can move yourself'.  What happened next and who was responsible is contentious, but a system allegedly capable of handling 12,000 bags an hour broke down with a flow of half that. Suddenly, the sparse manning, insufficient dry runs, failure to test properly the new systems and lack of contingency planning by BAA, owner of the airport, and BA were exposed. Planes took off without baggage or were cancelled, a problem that has continued through the weekend. Distressed travellers paid inflated prices for emergency overnight hotels. The media went into overdrive, bringing us the bitter soundbites we cherish amid the all-too-familiar Heathrow-in-chaos story, even though many flights and passengers were taking off from the terminal as planned. None the less, 200 cancelled flights is 200 cancelled flights too many, especially when so much was promised. Once he appeared, Walsh apologised over and over.  The warning that a debacle was imminent was the self-confidence from both BA and BAA beforehand that all would be well. BA's priority under Walsh has been cost, with savings sought in manning and training. BAA has had similar priorities for decades and an unrivalled reputation for dysfunction. As their promises and boasts mounted, the patience of the gods clearly snapped. It is so sad - and so avoidable. BA remains a good airline, with many great staff who deserve better. When I turned up to take a look on Friday, the people on the ground could hardly have been more helpful, or crestfallen, about what had happened. Terminal 5 is a superb celebration of contemporary architecture, Richard Rogers on song. There is a generosity about the design that immediately lifts your spirits. Every opportunity has been seized to please the eye - vaulted ceilings and stunning glass-and-steel walls. I thought Shanghai and Madrid airports the world's best until I saw Terminal 5.  But such pride struggles against the cock-up, likely to be the first of many. Even if BA gets its act together, its partner remains BAA. I was at Terminal 4 a month ago when the baggage belts broke, causing far more cancelled flights; that was just a routine breakdown unworthy of media attention.  The problem is that airports, like power plants, printing presses or car factories, are complex. It is not just a question of having up-to-date equipment, like the celebrated 12 miles of computer-driven baggage belts at Terminal 5. It is having the organisational capability to run them continuously, a question of skill, employee engagement, management dexterity and punctilious observation of the right process. This is neither BAA's nor BA's strength. Like most of the British private sector, they suffer from deeply ingrained biases against smart working. Any company that wants to improve what it is doing has to invest in the skills of its employees. It is well known in management theory that you have to run the organisation at lower levels of output while time is set aside to invest in the new capability. The trade-off is delicate. Holding back means financial pain. On the other hand, trying to improve capability on the hoof, while simultaneously maintaining output, means corners are cut. Companies have to find the right balance. British companies, BA included, almost always decide to improve capability on the hoof. One BA baggage handler said there had been only four 'familiarisation days' before Terminal 5 - a small city in scale - went live. On the day, there were problems of car park access, ID cards and lift systems. There were either no or poorly implemented contingency plans for broken computer or baggage systems. The derided public sector, for all its weaknesses, is much more organisationally robust. The trouble is that BA's short-term shareholders permit the company no other option. BA needs to meet expectations of growing dividends and profits from owners who have no commitment to its long-term future. There are City rumours that takeover predators are circling, with the Emirates most frequently cited. Willy Walsh might have cut costs to the bone as morale has crashed - a recent staff survey alarmingly reported that nearly 30 per cent of staff claim they had been bullied - but he is trying to secure his airline's independence.  Equally, BAA suffered years of neglect as it vainly tried to preserve its independence. Shareholders did not hesitate over it being taken over, with a crippling £9bn of borrowed money by Spanish construction company Grupo Ferrovial, which knew next to nothing about the economics and politics of British airports.  Its principal interest now is raising passenger landing charges and raising traffic to service the crippling debt rather than improving infrastructure. In the circumstances, nobody should be surprised. A sane government would have overruled the merger because it implied too much debt. That, however, would have been considered 'anti-business' because it would have constrained investment bankers' bonuses by preventing a stupid takeover that was plainly against the travelling public's interest. To force BAA's management to think long term would have been 'interventionist'.  Terminal 5's problems are more than teething troubles; they are symptomatic of deeper weaknesses in our private sector which, until we recast the way we do business, will continue to plague us.","Will Hutton: Terminal 5, another British cock-up that had to happen",2008-03-30T00:03:18Z,Will Hutton,uk
"The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales edited by John Davies, et al 1104pp, University of Wales, £65 Something is stirring west of Offa's Dyke. Welsh rugby players are winning, Welsh singers singing, Welsh politicians devolving, Welsh house prices soaring. And writers have stopped tearing out their hair in a paranoid rage over ""What is Wales?"" Besides, they now have a thundering 1,000-page answer, the Welsh Academy's superb Encyclopaedia of Wales. If ever a country were encapsulated in a volume, this is it. The project was begun in 1999 and published separately in English and Welsh. In a genre long cursed by Britannica's notorious ""for Wales, see England"", it takes pride of place alongside the Dictionary of Welsh Biography, the Companion to Welsh Literature and the Pevsner buildings of Wales series. Unlike Peter Lord's recent and scholarly The Visual Culture of Wales, this is essentially a compendium of known sources, a snappy vade mecum to a nation so often ridiculed and neglected as to be omitted completely from a recent European Union map. The range is exhaustive and serendipitous, embracing not just history, biography and topography but a gazetteer of all 869 Welsh communities and generic entries for land forms, plants, economy, law, religion and women (but not men, unless they are ""of Harlech""). The entry for Wales itself supplies an admirable potted history. The entry for architecture is excellent, as is the recipe for Welsh cakes. The English appear as ""Wales's largest ethnic minority"". English place names are rightly used in what is a work in that language. The danger of burgling British (or worse, English) history is mostly avoided. The hundred years war is rightly included for its Welsh longbow-men. Gladstone is included for marrying into the principality, John Piper for celebrating it in paint and the Italian singer Adelina Patti for being its most celebrated second homer. That said, Bertrand Russell's presence is stretching things and inclusion of the English Plebs League suggests an editor's conceit. The inclusion of the Guardian's country diarist, William Condry, more than compensates. The Welsh diaspora is honoured, from the London Welsh to Pennsylvania and Patagonia. The family tree of the royal houses of Wales will be indispensable for those who wish to shine at Breconshire dinner parties. And I at last understand the Laws of Hywel Dda, surely the only lawyer to be assigned the suffix ""the good"". The editing of the authors down to short paragraphs makes this a rare encyclopedia that can be browsed enjoyably as a book (apart perhaps from the 19 pages of Joneses). Every page is illustrated with photographs, maps, plans and art reproductions. Thus we have Alan Sorrell's admirable recreations of Welsh castles, Richard Wilson's mountains, a film poster for Tiger Bay and copious works by Piper, Ceri Richards and Kyffin Williams. Nor is Wales left without humour. The madcap Regency poet and drug addict Edward Williams (alias Iolo Morganwg) invents the bardic gorsedd on top of the nearest mountain he could find, London's Primrose Hill. He reduced the noble eisteddfod to ridicule for its costumes ever since. A photograph of the famously gloomy RS Thomas has him ""experimenting with a smile"". The modernity of scope is remarkable. There is an entry for the M4 and for the great barrier reef between north and south Wales, the A470. The mortal attack on the Sir Galahad in the Falklands is included, as is Wales's victory in the 2005 rugby grand slam. The entry for Pontypool is justly illustrated by the town's celebrated 1976 front row. Recent immigrant groups, such as Welsh Poles and, believe it or not, Welsh Yemenis, are saluted. So are the new buildings of Cardiff Bay, emblems of Wales's devolved power in the 21st century. Wales's leading rock group, Super Furry Animals, are rightly included in a pantheon of stardom that includes Harry Secombe, Richard Burton, Shirley Bassey, Tom Jones, Geraint Evans, Katherine Jenkins, Aled Jones and Charlotte Church. It is a mark of the quality of this work that I found it so hard to find fault. The entry for pilgrimage is too cursory, there is too much sport and I would have welcomed more on Wales's landowning classes, such as the remarkable Georgian micro-culture of the Teifi valley. A mild leftwing bias renders some entries far too gentle. No mention is made of the role of the British Labour party or British trade unionism in stamping on emergent Welsh nationalism in the 20th century. I am not convinced that the 1979 referendum vote against devolution was against ""a national future"". It rather reflected the enervation of Welsh politics by generations of Labour leaders, who until 1964 refused Wales even its own secretary of state. This enervation continues in the suppression of Welsh local government, especially in north Wales, by the new Cardiff Assembly. The Prince of Wales and Rowan Williams may not be dead (needed for a full entry) but both merit more than passing references, the one for his love/hate relationship with Wales and the other for his love/hate relationship with the Anglican church. That said, the Welsh Conservative party is honoured and Wales's only Tory leader, Michael Howard, is mentioned in dispatches under Llanelli, including the information that his (Romanian Jewish) family took its name from the local Parc Howard. So what makes a nation that has yet to win more than a veneer of political autonomy even compared with the Scots? The answer must be a sense of territory, a coherent history, a shared culture and a worthy parade of national heroes. This book offers a cavalcade of all these in dazzling abundance. · Simon Jenkins's Thatcher and Sons: A Revolution in Three Acts is published by Penguin",Review: The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales ed John Davies et al,2008-03-29T00:29:58Z,Simon Jenkins,review
"It's taken nine months of gestation, and yesterday it was delivered. But when Jack Straw presented his baby to the House of Commons there was not much in the way of ooh-ing and aah-ing. Instead the package of constitutional reforms he showed off to MPs elicited little more than a shrug inside the Commons and disappointment outside. It served as another reminder that what matters in politics is rarely content alone. Just as important is context.  Last July it was Gordon Brown, rather than Straw, who unveiled a raft of measures to improve the way Britain is governed. Constitutional anoraks swooned, competing for superlatives. A new era in British governance had dawned.  The proposals Brown offered then were much the same as those advanced by Straw yesterday, promising to transfer key powers from the executive to parliament. Yet no one will be getting out the bunting this time. That's partly because there were telltale water stains all over the white paper and draft bill Straw launched yesterday - clear signs of dilution. Last July's promise of a shift in war powers from the prime minister to MPs now emerges in paler form: there will be no new law, merely a convention that MPs ought to vote on sending our troops into battle. Last year there was fevered hope that there would be a wholesale shake-up of the role of the attorney general - a law officer who simultaneously decides on prosecutions and sits in the cabinet, thereby embodying Britain's stubborn refusal to honour the separation of powers doctrine it claims to believe in. But guess what. The attorney general will remain both the government's chief legal adviser and a cabinet minister - even retaining the power to direct prosecutions in cases of national security. Calling off the BAE Systems corruption inquiry? A partisan minister advising on the legality of the Iraq war? Both could be repeated under Brown. Still, none of this explains why Straw's statement lacked the impact of Brown's nine months ago. For that, you have to look at the context. On July 3 2007, Brown had been in No 10 less than a week. A maiden prime ministerial speech on the constitution seemed to signal not only radical plans in this area, but a general seriousness of purpose. Brown was in the first of what would prove to be 12 golden weeks, in which the new leader confounded his critics, led the polls and seemed on course to win an electoral mandate of his own.  That is not where we are now. Today, Brown leads a government in deep trouble. It's not just behind in the polls, it is showing ideological drift: one minute sending coded signals that it plans to steer away from the Blairite affection for private providers in the public services, the next reaffirming the Blairite faith. While Brown appeared as a man of granite solidity last July, today he is mocked as a ditherer, forced to back down over capital gains tax or, just yesterday, embryo research. In this context, the very measures which won such plaudits last July appear weak now. Now you notice not the overall objective - to rebalance power in Britain - so much as the caveats and soggy promises of consultation. With the wind no longer at his back, Brown has to drive harder just to arrive at the same place. On the constitution, he has to be much bolder if he is to appear serious. That means more than simply delivering full-blooded versions of the promises floated nine months ago. It means dealing with the meaty problems in the middle of the plate, not just the untidy anomalies around the edge. The most obvious move would be to complete an item of unfinished business that has lingered for a century - and, at long last, allow the second chamber to feel the hot breath of democracy on its neck.  This was the best Straw could do on Lords reform yesterday: ""We are on track to publish a white paper before the summer recess."" That's right. Another flipping white paper. At least it's not a review, but it's not much better. Remember, reforming the House of Lords has been a Labour aspiration since the days of Keir Hardie. Indeed, the House of Commons has already voted for a fully elected second chamber. It did so in March last year, by a majority of 113. What the hell are they waiting for? Or Brown could push in practice what he used to muse on often in private during his 10-year wait - and declare his desire for a written constitution for Britain. In the pipeline is a British bill of rights and responsibilities, and there are plans for a ""citizens' summit"" of 500 Britons, chosen at random but weighted, like a pollster's sample, to reflect the makeup of the British population: their job will be to draw up a ""British statement of values"". These are not entirely pointless exercises, but one minister admitted to me yesterday that these texts come ""nowhere near"" a written constitution. If they don't, and given that we already have a Human Rights Act, it's hard to see what point these new documents would have or how they would endure. A written constitution has a clear purpose: it's an owner's manual, setting out for the people how the country they own operates. The US constitution is the model. Anything less than that high ideal risks becoming a transient exercise, all too easily dismissed as a gimmick. Who, after all, is moved by reading the timeless words of Labour's 2003 exercise, the Big Conversation? Or Brown could make a direct splash, by reforming the electoral system for the Commons. A debate is under way among ministers, kicking around the alternative vote (AV) system, which allows voters to name their second as well as first choice. It's not perfect or even properly proportional, but it would be an improvement on first past the post. Better still, it actually has a chance of winning the approval of MPs who refuse to countenance any system that breaks the constituency link. Some say Brown should promise AV now, with a view to delivering it after the next election. I say do it now.  There is an electoral calculation in going bold. The AV system, if implemented, might help Labour hold on to a few seats (though no one can quite tell). The mere promise of electoral reform of the Commons will make it hard for the Lib Dems to throatily oppose Brown or join the Tories in fuelling an anti-Labour mood in the country. Above all, the decisive pursuit of a risky goal will banish the talk of bottler Brown.  But there is another way Brown might think about this. He could decide that with the economy in the toilet and after 13 years in power, Labour will have next to no chance of winning a majority in April 2010. One ministerial ally of Brown's tells me that ""Brown thinks about his legacy just as much as Blair ever did"". In which case, why not conclude that, if you're going down anyway, you might as well leave your mark?  Think of it as the Butch and Sundance strategy, with Brown and Straw going down in a blaze of glory as they pursue one last radical change - a democratic second chamber, a written constitution, an improved voting system - that will outlive them and endure for the ages. Lets face it, such a legacy is not going to come in the economic area. The public services will not be turned around by 2010. But the constitution is ripe for dramatic, lasting change. That, surely, is better than staggering on for another two years, with nothing to show at the end but scars and defeat.  freedland@theguardian.com",Jonathan Freedland: Brown and Straw's best bet is to go out like Butch and Sundance,2008-03-26T00:04:32Z,Jonathan Freedland,politics
"It was a turning point in my life. The ex-grammar school boy trying to make his fortune in the City had just lost a chunk of his life savings because he had put himself on the wrong side of what is now called a 'trash and cash' operation or what in the 1970s we called a bear raid. I remember travelling home amazed at my lack of judgment, but reading in the evening paper that, whatever my haplessness, the company's employees were now losing their jobs. It was an incredible way to run a financial system or a company, a conviction that has never left me. I'd only had a walk-on part in the demise of Birmingham Small Arms (maker of BSA motorcycles). All morning, the shares had been beset by rumours of the company's imminent collapse and I had been buying them for the 'bounce' - the 20 or 30 minutes when they temporarily recovered before falling again. But dashing out of the office for a sandwich, I had been ambushed - the shares were suspended while I was in the queue before I could sell them again. I was an unwilling holder of now valueless pieces of paper. I knew virtually nothing about BSA, nor did anyone else buying or selling them that day. It was a casino chip, not a title of ownership that bestowed any responsibility to the company nor commitment to its prospects. Over the following weeks, I watched the Labour government and unions try to put BSA back together again. They never had a chance. The company, like so much of British industry, had been devastated by years of neglect, its transient owners interested only in the next dividend or chance to capitalise on short-term movements in the share price. Britain has constructed a financial system against committed business-building, hostile to genuine wealth-generation and paradoxically anti-capitalist. If it was bad in the 1970s, it is terrible today. It has always been an uphill struggle convincing anybody that a growing part of the City is now a British problem rather than an asset. In many ways, it is akin to the unions in the 1970s - over-powerful, economically dysfunctional, but so rich it has become an important paymaster for all the political parties, so insulating it from political attack. To criticise is to risk the double whammy of being cast as 'anti-business' and cutting off vital campaign cash, a calculation made by Tony Blair and now by Gordon Brown. But the events of the last six months are too awesome to be ignored. On Wednesday morning came yet more evidence of the City's dysfunctionality. HBOS, the country's largest mortgage lender, was shaken to its core by manufactured rumours that it was in dire trouble; over 30 minutes, the shares fell 17 per cent. Those trashing the company in a collusive syndicate will have pre-sold the shares (sometimes not the shares, but so-called contracts for difference, which are openly casino chips), aiming to cash in lower down when the rumours had panicked the markets. Hence 'trash and cash'. In our interconnected world, what happens in the stock market rapidly hits the interbank markets, in which financial institutions trade money. The danger was that HBOS might not be able raise routine cash in the interbank market, so that the rumours would become self-fulfilling and bring HBOS down, with implications for the entire financial system. Small wonder the Bank of England and Financial Services Authority went into overdrive, along with HBOS, to deny the story. In the meantime, someone somewhere had made millions from the sting. There has been a lot of tut-tutting, an investigation was announced that on past experience will achieve nothing, and excuses made about a few bad apples. It is phooey. What is happening is systemic, the predictable consequence of allowing the markets to become even more hyper and short term than they were 30 years ago. The City's much- vaunted 'innovation' boils down to little more than creating a market in a new class of financial asset for the lads to buy and sell.  One of the consequences is that banks deluded themselves into thinking they could lend more safely than before because now they could sell their loans to somebody else. For more than a decade, the system has pumped out credit, the banks growing their loans much faster than the rate of economic growth, so generating the credit and property price bubble. Dozens of great British companies have been taken over for no good reason, their short-term shareholders taking no more interest in their long-term prospects than I once did of BSA or anybody did of HBOS. And a few have made vast fortunes. Now we all have a problem. In effect, we have witnessed a private-sector-led reflation based on huge levels of new credit. At best, that credit will stall; at worst, it will dry up. The best case implies an economic slowdown, the worst case a property and financial system meltdown. The financial system needs to be reconstituted from first foundations. At present, change is being negotiated solely on the City's terms. The banks are beseeching the Bank of England to transform the rules about how they get cash when the Bank acts as lender of last resort. At present, they have to present gold-plated government bonds as collateral; they want to add risky private mortgages. In the circumstances of an imploding mortgage market, the Bank has no option but to be sympathetic, but if the taxpayer is going to run more risk, then there must be some quid pro quos.  The markets must be run less as casinos with financial assets the chips and the buyers and sellers able to hide their identity so easily. The practice of giving vast annual bonuses embeds greed and recklessness; it should be reined in. And if the property market is to be bailed out, we must rescue ordinary citizens as much as banks. Repossession should be much less brutal. The American government has created specialist banks which offer mortgage guarantees; we should establish similar institutions.  This agenda is off-limits for Mr Brown's Labour party, as wedded to City priorities as Ramsay MacDonald once was, or to Mr Cameron's Conservative party, largely financed by hedge funds. Even the Lib Dems, who have a great opportunity for conforming to their instincts if they have the chutzpah to seize it, are not independent of hedge fund paymasters. Today's lack of political criticism cannot last much longer - there is too much popular and even business demand for change. For the party capable of breaking the deadlock, the payback will be huge.","Will Hutton: If the City won't put its house in order, politicians must",2008-03-23T00:03:37Z,Will Hutton,politics
"Even someone like me, who views feminism in the simplest of football terms (choose your side and stick with it), cannot ignore the fact that just recently the male attitudes to Heather Mills have been by far the most open-minded and positive. These range from admiration for her taking on McCartney and the legal system, to assertions that she seems to be a caring mother, right through to an echo of my view, which wonders whether, as Mills often seems so mentally imbalanced, and may even be suffering from narcissistic personality disorder, the constant howls of 'Burn the witch!' say more about us than they do about her. Then there was the charming gentleman on the radio phone-in show who declared that Mills was, and I hope I quote correctly, 'nothing but a money-grabbing, peg-legged slag'. (Thank you, sir.) Even so, the varied and lively debate in the male quarter seems in stark contrast to the sour, narrow and somewhat 'unsisterly' way females both in the media and elsewhere have been reacting to Mills. Everywhere you look, Mills has attracted virulent woman-on-woman criticism. The overriding consensus was that McCartney deserved to win and, furthermore, to insist on the publication of the court judgment, which poured 58 pages of damning scorn upon his former wife's head. Even feminist commentators seemed to struggle to come out in unequivocal support of Mills. It is almost as if she has become an embarrassment - she is a woman who makes women look bad. And you can't help but wonder how it came to this? What does it say about the female gender that so many of us have succumbed to 'Heather fatigue'? At this stage, it's reasonable for anyone to be fatigued by the entire business. I for one would give a lot to be spared more of Ms Mills ranting away about her dreadful luck at only getting £24.3m instead of the £125m she wanted. Nor is anyone turning a blind eye to the hard evidence of her greed, lies, evasions, lust for self promotion and cringe-making, faux-feminist tantrums. Even when Mills hurled the jug of water over McCartney's barrister, Fiona Shackleton, for 'letting down womankind', she got it wrong. Shackleton has worked hard to reach the top of her profession; it is ludicrous to expect her to feel guilt at representing a male client.  All of this and much more Mills got wrong and was duly criticised. And yet, where was the equivalent uproar when she was in the right? Such as, after the court judgment, when McCartney was hailed as god-like and forgiving when he said he wanted to make peace for the sake of Beatrice.  The same goes for silly stuff, such as McCartney's claim that Mills insisted on accompanying him on tours because she wanted to be the 'centre of attention'. All highly believable, except I have been on tours - they are so boring you'd chew your arm off to escape. Even rock stars admit that only being onstage (you know, being 'the centre of attention') makes them bearable. More seriously, there was the panning of Mills's assertion that she had been McCartney's 'full-time wife, lover, confidante, business partner and psychologist'. In real life, a constant female complaint is the amount of unpaid, unrecognised, unreciprocated 'emotional admin' that's expected of women in relationships. We've all been there and we've all carped about it. Shocking, then, that when Mills brings it up, not one female says a word in her defence. Instead, Mills is left to be ridiculed and slapped down in court almost as though she'd claimed to have written 'Yesterday'. Maybe this is what feels so wrong about the trashing of Heather Mills. In the end, it was too comprehensive, too gloating and unquestioning. It stands to reason that Mills is not the feminist martyr she thinks she is. It is also clear she has colluded in her current status as 'dancing bear' of the international media, to be prodded, poked and baited at will. However, all along, there have been reasons for women to support and defend Mad Bad Heather and, arguably, not enough of us have. With the current wave of 'Heather fatigue', it's almost as if Mills became a convenient female sacrifice to the male establishment gods, as in: 'There you go guys, rip this one apart, because we don't like her much either.' Indeed, thinking back to that idea of feminism in the simplest of football terms, the abandonment of Heather Mills may yet be seen as a memorable own goal. How a sinner can now be a winner David Paterson, freshly appointed successor to Eliot Spitzer, who was disgraced for hiring call girls, was already the first black New York governor and the first to be legally blind in US history. Now he has scored another first by announcing within hours of being sworn in that he's had extramarital affairs in the past, as has his wife Michelle. His rationale: 'I did not want to be compromised, I did not want to be blackmailed.' One could be cynical: is this a clever unburdening act; scandal pre-emption, with Blue Peter undertones, as in: 'Here's a scandal I made earlier'? Or could it run deeper than that? Are we witnessing a new dawn of sexual transparency in politics? A brave new world where politicians confess all and emerge morally cleansed, untouchable, in the eyes of the press and the public? You see, Bill, Jeffrey, there is another way. People of Britain - take up your pens and save our post offices As a rule, there are three things guaranteed to make me feel patriotic: Poppy Day, the theme tune of Coronation Street and those bits of Children in Need where the staff of building societies sweat unattractively on school sports fields, doing sponsored egg-and-spoon races To this list I can now add the sad little chairs all along my street, upon which sit clipboards bearing petitions to save our local post office. They are in the shops, too, and I must have signed about 40 times, forging a few signatures here and there, but don't go telling anyone. One day, myself and other locals stood in the actual doomed post office, for a good 40 minutes, among the penny sweets and the hanging cards of combs, bitching furiously about the proposed closure. Which, touching in itself, is about as close to a 'sense of community' most Londoners are going to get. Why are the British public so upset about this? One reason could be that, self-centred though we all are, many of us hate the thought of old ladies having to hobble miles for their pensions. But really, we know they don't have to and, anyway, it is so much more than that. For a start, most post office shops are so sweet and strange. Is anyone in this fast-turning modern world in the market for a 26p birthday card featuring a sketch of a young boy earnestly fishing? Probably not. Yet it has been a staple of every post office I've ever been in. As have the boxes of single 'extra-large' envelopes, packets of elastic bands and so-cheap-it's-offensive wrapping paper. All of this makes me want to cry. In a good way. What's more, as much as post offices are practical, they are also spiritual, one of the few unifying constants of modern life. Rich people posting parcels, poor people cashing giros - it all happens in the post office. Indeed, you can forget the Big Brother sofa - the average post office queue is a far truer microcosm of British society. What are they going to replace these loss-making cultural motherships with - another branch of Starbucks? Not on my watch. For the sake of the nation, we must all keep signing and, if necessary, forging. Go on, pick up the ballpoint and, just this once, think of your country. Don't write Jordan off just because she doesn't actually write The literary community is up in arms about the shortlisting of Katie Price's Perfect Ponies for the WH Smith children's book of the year at the Galaxy British Book Awards next month. The problem seems to be that Price, aka glamour model Jordan, has not 'written' her book in the strictest or, indeed, any sense of the word, in the same way she did not 'write' any of her multimillion-selling autobiographies and novels. Does this make Price the Milli Vanilli of British literature? Children's Laureate Michael Rosen doesn't think so: 'We get too hung up about authorship.' Others, from James Naughtie to Tracy Chevalier and Joanne Harris, have been more sniffy. Robert Harris said the nomination was 'emblematic of the tacky culture we live in'. Ladies and gentlemen, please. If Ms Price wanted endless pouting and bitching, she could renew her feud with Victoria Beckham. In a perfect world, Price would have written her own books. Then again, maybe she's a bit busy, being a global entity, wife and nannyless mother of three children (one severely disabled).  I met Price and she's an unpretentious, business-minded soul, content with being a successful brand rather than a 'real' scribe. And she has never once lied about writing her books, a fact which has never stopped them selling. Her novel Crystal alone outsold the entire Booker shortlist, making her the Heat generation's Jackie Collins. Maybe this is the problem. People actually buy Price's books, which is seen as increasingly perverted in the beleaguered book industry.","Barbara Ellen: Come on, let's give Heather the thumbs-up for a change",2008-03-23T00:03:37Z,Barbara Ellen,world
"How does an atheist confront Easter in the post-Dawkins age? He has, let us say, granted religion its plea for respect. He lives and lets believe, and no longer rants from the pulpit in the style of the master, calling down the fire and brimstone of rationalism on the congregation below. Most religions are smart enough to use spring as a metaphor for reincarnation. Birds sing, eggs hatch, buds burst into life and, if you like, God is love. Only a misanthrope would deny the stirring of springtime juices and not dream of resurrection. Can atheism and religion find some accommodation at Easter? I am comfortable with the atheist stall set out by Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, Daniel Dennett and others. I find the intellectual chase exhilarating, but as the huntsmen run the stag to earth what Dawkins calls my ""cultural hard-wiring"" holds me back from the coup de grace. Christianity is a core component of my civilisation, as astrology has been to others. The demise of its specific beliefs among most clear-thinking people in no way lessens my admiration for the Sermon on the Mount or my respect for its ""placebo"" value for millions of people. In such a generous spirit I read last week's assault on Dawkins and Co on these pages by John Gray. It made me realise just how bad-tempered the death-of-god debate has become. Gray's contribution to moral philosophy is rightly to assert that human history is too complicated to admit glib certainties. In Black Mass, his recent attack on liberal utopias, Gray calls for ""a discipline of thought that may be too austere for a culture that prizes psychological comfort above everything else"". Hence his pessimistic realism, an acceptance that the world is and always will be awash in horror and superstition. Atheism, like the science on which it is based, is just another faith, another manifestation of his aversion to ""catastrophic optimism"". Gray's attack on Dawkins is anything but disciplined. He constantly attacks ""evangelical"" atheism, ""zealous"" atheism and ""fundamentalist"" atheism without quite engaging with atheism. Indeed much of Gray's assault is on newly militant atheism's modus operandi, its shrill propagandising, rather than its content. This is Tony Blair's trick (in opposing a ""naïve, outdated socialism"") of using qualifiers to get inconvenient nouns off the hook. Dawkins and Co are criticised for believing that ""the sort of advance that has been achieved in science can be reproduced in ethics and politics"". Gray points out that slavery has not yet been eradicated and that Nazism and communism were very bad, and many atheists ""fail to mention"" this fact. Even the Taliban are cited to prove that secularism is in retreat. Gray seems to regard human society as in a steady state of original sin, and thus any idea of ""the advance of science is itself an article of faith"". Few would agree with Gray that humankind has not evolved - or ""progressed"" - from primitivism to relative civility over the aeons of life on earth. The fact that much science is bogus and has been abused by politics does not discredit the scientific method any more than it validates religion. All can play the history game. This is just point scoring. I would leave both religion and atheism out of the evolutionary account, which Darwinism can handle on its own. But this is the essence of Dawkins's case. Gray says that religion is like sex in ""the impossibility of its suppression"". But I am not interested in suppression. It is perfectly reasonable to forecast that religion might be ""evolved out"" of human understanding, as science explains each new phenomenon pleaded in aid by religion or, at least, convinces people that such explanation might one day be possible. The wilder shores of theology are already reductionist, dabbling in social anthropology and refining such terms as god, soul and immortality. Religion has itself evolved from blood sacrifice to the subtleties of the ontological ""god"". For increasing numbers of people this reductionism slithers into ""agnosticism"". Religion is a mental appendix, outdated but not yet extinct (and sometimes sorely inflamed). Faith is to Gray one of the many complex ingredients in the chop suey of his cosmos, a manifestation of ""the incomprehensibility of the divine"". When he hears Dawkins ranting he duly lumps atheism into the same category as ""an ersatz religion"", in its case guilty of blind faith in the myth of progress. I do not regard atheism as a faith, and Dawkins goes to some lengths in The God Delusion to rebut this ""guilt by association"". Atheism does not accept the existence of a supernatural god, but this is not an act of faith. It applies the normal tests of proof to the claims of others. Were religion merely ""faith"" it would indeed be incomprehensible. The trouble starts when it lays proprietary claim to normal words such as truth, goodness, beauty, virgin birth, resurrection and salvation, and redefines them to its own ends. Words must carry agreed meanings if humans are to live happily together. Atheism need not be zealous, evangelical or fundamental. It need not even subscribe to Gray's derided belief in progress. It is sceptical in the proper sense, courteous, tolerant, questioning and deductive. But the fact that we cannot explain everything about us - even the joys of spring - has absolutely no bearing on the existence of a god. I cannot argue with a man who ""believes"" the Earth to be flat. Most people regard the idea as absurd unless the word flat is redefined to mean round. I feel the same about Easter's ""resurrection of the dead"". The most lively of Dawkins's critics is the former Bishop of Oxford, Richard Harries, an apostle of what Dawkins would call the ""much-needed gap"" explanation of God - dismissed by Dawkins as ""the mother of all burkas"". In his writing on aesthetics Harries claims to find God in such concepts as beauty and artistic creativity. A sign of His handiwork is humanity's eternal assault on the mountains of the sublime. I do not need God to help me wonder. I am patient and will, if need be, await the contribution of genetics and neurology to our understanding of art. If Harries claims to have found God in Michelangelo's studio I am happy for him. But I protest that any sensitive atheist can enjoy the sights, sounds and smells of what Christians call Eastertide. He can exult at Haydn's Creation and chase the painted egg across the lawn without the prop of an organised, or disorganised, religion.",Simon Jenkins replies to John Gray's challenge to Dawkins et al,2008-03-22T00:14:24Z,Simon Jenkins,review
"Like many novelists, the sci-fi writer Neil Gaiman rarely does a public reading without being asked the tiresome question: ""Where do you get your ideas?"" He used to respond facetiously - ""From a little ideas shop in Bognor Regis"" - but that grew boring. ""I make them up,"" he says now. ""Out of my head."" People don't like that. ""They look unhappy, as if I'm trying to slip a fast one past them,"" Gaiman writes. But the truth, he admits, is that he doesn't know where his ideas come from. Through history, creative people have said the same, but that hasn't staunched the deluge of pop psychology books on how to generate ideas. The surprising problem with some of them is they are amazingly boring; How To Have Creative Ideas, by Edward de Bono, may contain useful advice, but, as with his other work, I've never had the perseverance to find out. (Hilariously, he once wrote a book called How You Can Be More Interesting.) More often, they're plagued by a familiar, soul-destroying ""zaniness"" of the kind that inspires those team-building awaydays where managers play paintball and try not to ponder the futility of existence. One such is Doug Hall's book Jump Start Your Brain: A Proven Method For Increasing Creativity By Up To 500%. Hall runs workshops using the Eureka!® Stimulus Response™ method, so next time you have a eureka moment, best ask his permission. It's tempting, amid this nonsense, to conclude that creativity is intrinsically mysterious and can't be elucidated. But what if we're just approaching it wrongly? ""Blue-sky thinking"", like its cousin ""outside the box"", has been mocked into obsolescence, but the metaphor they embody persists. We think of creativity as unrestrained and wild - that if we take the lids off our imaginations, great ideas will bubble up. (There are at least three books called Unleash Your Creativity.) But the counter-argument, increasingly influential in business, is that creativity thrives on constraint. ""Is there something in the nature of constraints that brings out the best creativity?"" wonders Scott Berkun, whose absorbing essays on innovation are at scottberkun.com. Consider a good haiku or sonnet, and the answer is obviously yes: it's precisely the limits of the form that inspire new ways of working inside them. In the workplace, that means no more open-ended brainstorming: if you want the best answers to a question, focus it narrowly; consider a time limit, too. Google sometimes puts fewer engineers on a problem than it needs; it inspires ingenuity. The blue-sky metaphor further implies that ideas come from nowhere. But every idea is a combination of others, Berkun notes. ""Say it five times... Every amazing creative thing you've ever seen [can] be broken down into smaller ideas that existed before. An automobile? An engine plus wheels. A telephone? Electricity plus sound... If you want to be a creator instead of a mere consumer, you must see ideas currently in the world as... ingredients waiting for reuse."" So the pressure's off. You don't have to launch yourself into blue sky, nor conjure ideas from thin air. In fact, you won't succeed if you try. oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com",This column will change your life,2008-03-22T00:06:25Z,Oliver Burkeman,society
"She's ""responsible for nine countries"", she gives lawyers unsolicited makeovers, she wants us to drink rat-milk lattes - only the terminally tedious could deny that Heather Mills adds to the gaiety of the nation. Thrice alas, then, that the reaction to this week's conclusion of the Mills-McCartney severance pageant has been so utterly po-faced. Expressing outrage at Heather Mills's behaviour is like being given free tickets to a performance of Gielgud's Hamlet and whining afterwards that the prince had a few emotional problems. It rather misses the point. How very stodgy people must like their public theatre if they derive anything but merriment from this most priceless of unedifying break-ups. Throughout their wrangling, the Mills-McCartneys have acted like a sort of privatised royal family, putting on a show of quite unprecedented amusement to anyone but the child involved and their immediate relatives. Regrettable for the families, admittedly, but they only hurt their own. The rest of us have been gifted a Windsor-esque farce without having to pay a penny in tax for it. Comfortably the most civilised reaction to the business came in a letter to the Daily Mirror from one Chris Bowring of Wokingham. ""Heather Mills is awarded £24m out of Macca's fortune of £400m,"" he wrote. ""And Paul has saved £75m on what he feared he'd have to fork out. These figures are utterly alien to ordinary folk. We might as well be living on different planets - but it's all thoroughly good entertainment!"" Quite. Nobody died, as the retort goes, and nobody will go hungry. Very far from it indeed, on both sides. None of which is to excuse Heather's naughtiness, but that's been in evidence right from the moment she published her hilarious 1995 autobiography, Out On a Limb. By the time you come to the bit where she claims to have brought the war in the former Yugoslavia to the world's attention, I defy you not to giggle. Yet from the way people have been fulminating this week, some would probably drone that she was taking credit from people who actually did bring the war to the world's attention. Can we please avoid tumbling down the rabbit hole? None of it can possibly be engaged with seriously. We all know that Heather and strict candour parted company a very long time ago, if indeed they were ever acquainted. Yet absurdity has attended the Mills-McCartney union from the minute of its inception, with Heather's reply to the suggestion that she might be after Sir Macca's millions a timeless gem. ""If I was going to go out with anybody for their money,"" she sniffed, ""it would be someone a lot richer."" Her fiance's wealth was estimated at £700m at the time. So from the beginning the tone of farce was set, and there is no earthly reason to treat the performance as anything else now the curtain has come down. The attempt to learn things from celebrities' lives is one of the more witless obsessions of the modern age. Anyway, Sir Paul appears to have been the only person in the land not to have seen Heather coming a mile off, despite extensive attempts to enlighten him. For a man of his extraordinarily ample means, perhaps £24.5m can be regarded as a reasonable tax on stupidity. It's not much different from people playing the lottery - a crazy dream that has about the same odds of working out as the Mills-McCartney marriage. The only confusing part is that he insisted on going to court. From what we know of his thoughts on his ex, it would not be unreasonable to infer that he believes he has saddled his youngest child with a somewhat tricky mother. So it is intriguing that rather than come to a private settlement with Heather, he chose instead a course of action that would add significantly to the upsetting material their daughter will one day read. If you can afford to lessen the upset to your child - if you will remain as rich as Croesus whatever you fork out - you'd think you'd pay and cut your losses. It's only money, after all, and as yet another ""source close to Sir Paul"" was briefing this week, he's ""an old hippy at heart"" who ""holds true to the principles of love and peace"". (I always thought he had a touch of the celebrity Conservatives to him, but there you go.) Perhaps at some level our old hippy enjoys little feuds: do recall his endlessly magnanimous efforts to transpose the Lennon-McCartney songwriting credits on the Beatles back catalogue. ""It's been a battle for years,"" one notable Beatles historian has commented wearily, ""and in the case of Anthology Vol 2 ... we had to reprint the packaging. It was very disappointing."" Or consider his tireless quest to be the most working-class Beatle, which was still under way just the 21 years after Lennon's murder. ""Everyone thought John was the hard, working-class hero,"" Sir Macca explained to an interviewer. ""If you look at his house, he was actually the middle-class one from Woolton. We were the scruffs. He had the full works of Winston Churchill. Nobody any of us knew had that. A set of encyclopedia was the most anyone in our class had. But he had the works of Winston Churchill ..."" Yes, yes, you've made your point. No doubt the outgoing Lady McCartney will have plenty more of her own to make in future, and public life is far less dull for such characters. Heather is just one picaresque heroine in the great comedy, a sort of latter-day Moll Flanders, rampaging through a semi-fantasy world. And why not? The Frog Chorus doesn't have the monopoly on nauseating make-believe. marina.hyde@theguardian.com",Marina Hyde: Public life would be far duller but  for the likes of rampaging Heather,2008-03-22T00:03:37Z,Marina Hyde,uk
"In What Is Intelligence?, his recent book about the massive increases in IQ that have occurred within the last century, James R Flynn enlarges on differences between our own minds and those of our pre-scientific ancestors. Invited to use logic to speculate about the existence of white bears, for instance, a Russian peasant of the early last century told his interviewer: 'I have seen only black bears and I do not talk of what I have not seen.' A differently educated modern mind, on the other hand, is equipped to deal with the hypothetical question: 'All bears are white where there is always snow; in Novaya Zemlya, there is always snow; what colour are the bears there?' In politics, this cognitive progress has led to some improvements. In the early debates on women's suffrage, for example, American congressmen would happily substitute for argument their own concrete experience: 'My wife says she doesn't want to vote, that settles it for me.' Today, Flynn points out: 'No one would want that to appear under their name in the congressional record. It's not just that it would be anti-woman, it's just that it sounds so stupid.'  There are, however, regional variations. British children, according to one study, recently appeared to fall back in their grasp of abstract thinking. Turning to the current generation of British politicians, there are hints that they, too, may be reverting to the concrete referents of our recent ancestors. True, David Cameron, the Tory leader, has not, as yet, suggested that most women should go and sell £1,000 handbags in Smythson of New Bond Street, purely because this activity makes Samantha so happy. Yet his latest surge of publicity, most of it comprising pictures of him at home with Samantha and their three children does suggest a certainty on his part that nothing could be more persuasive of the merits of Tory family policy than physical evidence of the fabulous contentment and prosperity enjoyed by his Tory family. Or as a Russian peasant might put it: 'I have seen only the Boden catalogue and I do not talk of what I have not seen.'  For affluent, metropolitan Conservative families with roughly the same number of children as the Camerons, these domestic scenes may look inspiring. And bold, when you look at the confident use of colour and open-plan space. Interesting, too, that the Cameron family values have changed; the porridge that featured in his first Webcameron kitchen broadcast has been replaced by a selection of more classless breakfast cereals, including Cheerios and Shreddies. Yes, we can! But will this inclusive touch be enough to prevent other less conventional or materially fortunate families recoiling from a performance which could easily be interpreted as smug, patronising and, above all, stupid?  One need hardly point out that this glimpse of west London bliss could have been designed to illustrate the untruth of Cameron's assertion on the News at Ten that 'the anxieties and challenges of parenting are universal'. To say nothing of the solutions to these challenges, which include, in the Camerons' case, a full-time nanny (not shown). On the ConservativeHome website, one critic has also objected to the sight of three packets of cereal on the breakfast table, since these are so likely to be knocked over, along with the milk. Others have found fault with Cameron's earlier family proposal, to supply every new mother with a maternity nurse, tasked with 'monitoring visitors to the mother's home to ensure that rest times are not interrupted'.  Even mothers, like myself, who appreciate his interest, may wonder, given the varieties of human suffering in this country, what, exactly, moved Cameron to feel such pity and concern. Would the mother's plight have struck him so forcefully had he not recently witnessed it in his own home? Along with the challenge of bagging a good state school place, the challenge of having a child with special needs and the challenge of finding a park that is not covered in dog shit, all of them trusted Cameron themes. How else would he know about them? As the peasant said in 1920, of Novaya Zemlya: 'If a person has not been there, he can not say anything on the basis of words. If a man was 60 or 80 and had seen a white bear there and told me about it, he could be believed.' This must be why Cameron employs Iain Duncan Smith to tell him about poor people.  An unwarranted emphasis on the hard-won lessons of one's personal history is not, of course, unusual in politicians. Mrs Thatcher posed as a housewife, Kinnock blubbed about deprivation, Cherie enthused about hand-knits. Blair brought out his anecdotes and family snaps, while Brown, more protective of his privacy, has none the less made so much of the political lessons of becoming a father that we should all be very grateful to Sarah Brown, without whom there might be no schools. To judge by last week's performance, however, Cameron seems determined to go further, defending the latest family promo as proof that: 'Nothing informs my thinking more than family because I think it's the most important thing there is in our society.' Leaving aside the kind of family attachment that would lead a father to trade his children's privacy for career advancement, there must be a risk that this commitment to graphic PR will inhibit the development of his political philosophy, supposing he plans to go in for one. Although it has proved possible to illustrate green values, both private (here is his bike), and global (see his dogsled) and his family ones (here's Nancy, of bag fame), more complex areas, such as fiscal planning, may not be as photogenic. Though perhaps a sock would do the trick. Last week, admittedly, the excited response to his breakfast show did help obscure obvious flaws in his largely unworkable his'n'hers maternity leave, the successor to his even more idiotic maternity nurse scheme. No matter: a replacement wheeze is sure to emerge shortly from one of the branches of Carluccio's where brave young mums still summon the energy for urgent discussions of family issues. Pilates or yoga? Cayenne or Touareg? How do you spell Christmas Fayre? What should they charge for a cupcake? Shouldn't there be free Suzuki lessons for gifted under-fives? Not to mention drop-in chefs to prepare nutritious sushi for the thousands of British mums going through the agony of having their kitchens done. It is Cameron's great insight, according to senior commentators, that he knows his party must begin to resemble 21st-century Britain. And even those of us who do not know people like the Camerons would have to agree that they may exist in the 21st century. Does it follow that a film showing their domestic arrangements makes a respectable substitute for political ideas? I think even an American congressman could have told us the answer to that. But as James R Flynn teaches us, cognitive progress may not stop people, even Etonian people with firsts in PPE, from acting stupidly. 'Have we begun to use science to enhance our ability to debate moral and social questions intelligently?' he asks. Not in the modern Tory party, we haven't.","Catherine Bennett: Less happy families, more ideas, please",2008-03-16T00:04:55Z,Catherine Bennett,politics
"Fiona MacKeown was by no means the first parent of a large family to travel from a rambling home in rural western England, in the middle of a damp winter, and see what Goa had to offer by way of diversion. Evelyn Waugh had six children (a seventh died in infancy); Fiona MacKeown had nine (eight since February 15, when her 15-year-old daughter Scarlett Keeling was found dead on the beach at Anjuna). Waugh travelled from Piers Court, a Georgian mansion in Gloucestershire. MacKeown came from a huddle of caravans near Bideford, Devon, a home summarised as ""a mountain of old tyres ... empty beer bottles ... and rubbish"" by Wednesday's Daily Mail. But the bigger difference is that Waugh left his children behind.  He came to Goa in December 1952. ""The scenery [is] delicious ... the people soft and friendly,"" he wrote to his wife. The Portuguese colony made a great deal of him. A car and guides were provided. While he was shaving one morning in his hotel, a solicitous official appeared and said, ""All the peoples in Goa are asking how you slept."" Waugh was no stranger to drink - nor probably to drugs in his youth - and like MacKeown he was a great traveller, though not a Romany. What he wanted out of Goa, however, was a religious rather than a sensual experience. As a Roman Catholic, he had come to witness the exposition of the sacred relics of St Francis Xavier, the Jesuit missionary whose body had been brought back from China to Goa in the 16th century, where it had lain (minus its right forearm, which other missionaries had hacked off and taken to Rome) miraculously preserved in its glass and silver casket ever since. Waugh joined the queue in the cathedral, kissed a foot (""one brown stump of toe emerging from the white wrapping"") and then went off to a five-course lunch in the palace of the patriarch.  What did the name ""Goa"" mean then? In the west, almost nothing. India's independence five years before signalled that colonialism was coming to an end, but the countries of western Europe still had plenty of colonies. Goa was merely the oldest, a small enclave in India taken from its Muslim rulers by the Portuguese in 1510. The conquerors' religious zeal and skin-blind sexual desire meant many Goans were Catholic and of mixed race, but this hardly recommended them to either the rulers or the ruled in British India. All the qualities that were later distorted and exaggerated to make Goa ""the world's number one party destination"" met Anglo-Saxon disapproval. The explorer and translator Richard Burton, there in the 1840s, found it ""a worse than useless colony"" filled with drunk, lazy men, and abundant evidence that religious conversion and miscegenation led to ""the utter degeneracy of the breed"".  Degeneracy to one writer in one age is harmony to a different writer in another. Ten years after Waugh departed, his friend and fellow Catholic Graham Greene arrived to write a piece called Goa the Unique. Goa had been repugnant to Burton; to Waugh it seemed either sacred or quaint; but in the give-and-take of its villages and mixture of religions Greene glimpsed of a happier society than many countries, including India at large, had achieved. He stayed with a civil servant in a government bungalow. The civil servant's young wife, Maria Couto, remembers that at a party one night Greene was offered Benzedrine and took some. The Coutos had never seen recreational drugs before. Remembering this to me this week, Maria Couto said, ""The important thing to stress is that it wasn't offered by a Goan - it came from a German girl.""  The year was 1963. Two years earlier India had invaded or ""liberated"" Goa after a long confrontation with Portugal's dictator, António de Oliveira Salazar. As Maria Couto explains in her recent history of Goa, A Daughter's Story, it was the years of Indian blockade that laid the foundations of a new Goan way of money-making that you might say, taking an impossibly long view, killed Scarlett Keeling. Salazar was a defiant imperialist who determined that Goa would survive any shortages. Imports went far beyond local needs: potatoes and oranges from Europe replaced Indian sources, but there was also gold, watches and liquor, with the surplus smuggled to India. Goa's iron ore deposits became an ever more crucial export; mining licences were granted indiscriminately. Agricultural labour became scarcer, the coconut crop smaller, the police more corrupt. What Couto calls ""a seamy side of life"" developed that was well placed to take advantage of every drug-seeker, sun-worshipper and property speculator who has arrived in Goa in the 50 years since. We know what hippies made of Goa when they first saw it in the late 1960s because they've given us accounts of the empty beaches, friendly shack-owners and cheap charas. But what, in turn, did Goa make of the hippies? In 1984 in the capital Panjim I met a local historian who recalled his first sight of one. ""She was sitting on a bench reading a paperback edition of Wordsworth - I think it was the Prelude. But she was dirty. I had never seen a dirty European before."" Today the beaches of north Goa have signs in Hebrew and Cyrillic as well as English, and gangs from Israel and Russia control a substantial part of the trade in drugs. On the coast, a building boom threatens mangrove swamps and cashew groves with shopping malls, gated communities, flat-shares, golf courses and hotels. Naturally, there is a Save Goa society, struggling against a tide of money and concrete, drugs and paedophilia. None of this was planned, and 25 years ago - before the beach trance parties, before the cornucopian world economy - it would have been hard to predict. Still, it would be foolish to imagine 1984 represented a continuation of a 60s utopia where, so we are led to believe, happy young people sheltered under palm trees puffing chillums and reading Jack Kerouac.  The lost, the damaged and the crooked were already there and stumbling about. That year, also in Panjim, I met Grace de Souza, who did unpaid work for the British high commission in Mumbai by trying to find Britons reported missing in Goa by their parents. She had many stories. The young Australian who'd lit a fire under a tree and climbed up it, believing himself dead and needing cremation; the English girl who at the sight of her anxious mother, fresh off the plane, had ""screamed blue bloody murder"" until she was taken to the asylum; the night the morgue held six young white bodies, all thought to have drowned in separate incidents. ""It used to be just hash, grass and LSD,"" she said, ""but now we've got cocaine and brown sugar. Even Goans are on heroin.""  It was to an even darker scene that Fiona MacKeown brought her family in November last year: a woman born of an age which has somehow forgotten to teach both caution and curiosity, in the belief - not shared by Burton, Waugh and Greene - that apart from the weather everywhere is much the same.",Ian Jack: The land where the hippy trail reaches a historic impasse,2008-03-15T00:48:48Z,Ian Jack,world
"Do you remember when freak winds brought our country to a complete standstill? Do you remember when a man brought Heathrow to a complete standstill when he scaled a fence wearing a rucksack? Crazy days, readers, crazy days. And all of them this week. If a Sunday newspaper reporter manages to smuggle a replica gun into Terminal Five in one of those replica news stories, we'll have our hat-trick. For all the giddy drama of it all, though, one might hesitate to trot out the old adage that we live in interesting times. If we do, we're certainly carrying on regardless of them. The observation that constantly updating news turns every minor event into a crisis is not exactly what you'd call breaking news. (Sky would, naturally. They might even get the Skycopter on it.) But in the week when the Brown government appears to be casting around again for that elusive big idea, and has alighted on ""What is Britishness?"", the sheer drama-queeniness of the news media seems an excellent definition of what isn't. If you had to come up with the very opposite of what it means to be British - and we've always been better at defining ourselves against things - it would be this hammy insistence that we can't cope with wind, or that one weirdo breaching the Heathrow perimeter will make one iota of difference to the volume of air travel, or indeed to the life of anyone except the chap himself and whoever monitors the CCTV cameras that cover that bit of fence. Most of this week's storm coverage might as well have been brought to you from the teacup in which it was taking place. One of the most iconic posters of the second world war - when it might be argued that Britishness was under rather more genuine threat than it is now - was the one which read simply ""Keep calm and carry on"". In recent years this simple, unfussy exhortation has enjoyed a surge in popularity, and it has been reprinted as a poster, on T-shirts - all manner of places, really, except on the briefing notes of reporters required to stand on a pier and affect the pose of someone about to be claimed by the sea. These days, even keeping calm and carrying on is under threat from those who would cast it as something else entirely. In the weeks after the 7/7 bombings, you couldn't move for reports stating that Londoners going to work were ""acting defiantly"". Were they heck. They were just carrying on with their business. It was not some querulous, plucky, ""otherwise the terrorists will have won"" situation. It was an ""otherwise I will default on my mortgage and that'll be a bit of a bugger"" situation. If anthropomorphism is the attribution of human characteristics to creatures that patently do not possess them, then what are we to call this insistence on imposing the conventions of the news media on humans? Newsomorphism, perhaps - a word as clunky and preposterous as the practice it describes. Not that we don't all do it. Heaven knows the tendency to cast an event in keeping with convention can be seen in every newspaper and news bulletin in the land to varying degrees. An old truism states there are only 10 tabloid showbiz stories, for instance - things like ""is set to wed"", ""is set to split from"" and ""has splashed out on a new"". All human experience can and will be shoehorned into these templates.  And so it is with the Brown administration's attempt to define what it means to be a citizen of ""this septic isle"", as a dewy-eyed Derek Trotter once mis-eulogised Britain in Only Fools and Horses. The attempt to distil the richness of British life into some ""statement of values"" will pare down people's experience of it to such a degree as to be meaningless.  Lord Goldsmith's plan to define Britishness is what philosophers call a category mistake - an attempt to ascribe characteristics to something that could not possibly exhibit such characteristics, or not in the way that has been stated. It is pointless attempting to proscribe something and asking people to salute your definition. Britishness is a quality that people tend to identify in specific experiences, and largely after the event. Some weeks after the death of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko, who ate in a London sushi bar before succumbing to polonium poisoning, I remember reading that the sushi bar had gamely reopened for business. It had rebranded with a Russian spy theme. For all the fact that it was a sushi joint, and a chain at that, this seemed a sanguine, peculiarly British sort of way of just, well, carrying on. When it was founded just a decade ago, BBC News 24 promised to give us ""the whole picture of the whole country the whole time"". Watching the chap at Heathrow and the windy day distorted into national dramas brought home the folly of making such grandiose pledges, in mission statements or citizenship ceremonies or anywhere else. If we must have a national motto, perhaps we could leave it at ""Keep calm and carry on""?  marina.hyde@theguardian.com",Marina Hyde: Britishness?

"Sitting on my desk is an illegal acquisition, a black pebble the size of a walnut. I picked it up some years ago on the slopes of Cape Crozier on Ross Island in the Antarctic. This vast wilderness of rock and ice lies on a cliff overlooking the Ross Sea and is celebrated as destination of the ""worst journey in the world"". This was the title of the book written by Apsley Cherry-Garrard about a trip taken by him and two colleagues from Scott's 1911 polar expedition to acquire the eggs of the Emperor penguin. The storm shelter of stones, canvas and bits of sledge from which they barely escaped alive still lies on the cape, literally frozen in time. I was visiting it with the doughty New Zealander David Harrowfield, recorder and conserver of the relics of mankind's earliest settlements on the Antarctic continent, including the vulnerable Scott and Shackleton huts. The spot must be one of the most breathtaking on earth, looking south over the Ross ice shelf towards the pole and north to the sweeping ocean icebergs. But it is forbidden to take anything from this land. No matter that removing my pebble had as much ecological impact as taking a grain of sand from the Sahara. The rulers of the greatest nanny state on earth, Antarctica, had declared it their own and only they can remove bits of it. I await the arrival of the Antarctic police, handcuffs at the ready. We are in the midst of a flurry of centenaries of the heroic age of Antarctic exploration. One is of Shackleton's landing at Cape Royds and another, in three years, is of Scott's last, fatal voyage on the Terra Nova. Meanwhile, a combination of global warming and soaring raw material prices has seen a sudden revival of 50-year-old territorial aggrandisement, straining the agreements that govern the status of the polar regions. Russia has claimed the mineral rights to the sea bed under the north pole. America is impeding conservation agreements so as to press ahead with its Alaskan oil and gas exploration. Britain is celebrating the centenary of its first claim to Antarctica by demanding a million square kilometres of the south Atlantic ocean bed. This is under the UN law of the sea convention, based on adjacent territorial claims in Antarctica. Tourism has quadrupled in the past decade and continues to accelerate, despite the sinking last November of a cruise ship that hit an iceberg. Numbers rose last year alone by 14% to 37,000, almost all by ship. Tourists are banned from staying ashore and are strictly regulated as to what they can and cannot do. They are hated by scientists who ""won"" the continent under the 1959 Antarctic treaty and are reluctant to relinquish it or share it with others. Annual Antarctic conferences yield such headlines as ""Tourism threat to earth's last great wilderness"". Scientists apparently pose no threat. This double standard is well illustrated in the admirable Lonely Planet guide to Antarctica. A furious diktat against tourists picking up rocks or even feathers is carried alongside a scientist boasting the riches he has garnered from the place: ""The problem is not in finding the fossils but in deciding which ones to collect."" The 1959 treaty is regularly proclaimed as a rare success of world government, albeit one protected by geographical vastness and climatic ferocity. It has held while everyone turned a blind eye to the Americans, who agreed to abide by it as long as they could do what they liked, including build bases at the poles. They are now constructing a 1,000-mile ice highway from McMurdo Station to the south pole. A brown cloud of pollution hovers off the Ross Shelf air base, where not just Hercules transport planes but Globemaster military jets are now able to land. I can eulogise with the most florid romantic about the virgin wastes of ice, but I cannot see why nobody should be allowed to visit polar regions except scientists and eccentric explorers. The north and south ice caps are manifestly thawing and this is making both exploitation and tourism more feasible. The idea that a few lucky people should have exclusive rights to a mass of the world's surface is bizarre. It also leads to duplication and ridiculous national rivalry, such as India's building of a third base to prove that it is geologically part of Antarctica. Energy conservation may be a global imperative but to deny the peoples of the earth the mineral wealth of the Arctic regions is perverse. Aluminium, diamonds and even gold have been found in Greenland, so much so that the country is contemplating a return to the warm summers of the ninth century and independence of Denmark. Oil, gas and coal abound. If they are economic and their extraction can be governed by suitable environmental protocols - as is scientific research - what is the problem? There is no reason why millions should go cold or hungry because some people like the idea of somewhere on Earth being pristine - or a private research laboratory. The conservation of the polar bear is a worthy cause, but like lions and elephants they can cohabit with man. To use their cause to forbid mineral extraction in the Arctic is as silly as it would be to plead the Emperor penguin as a reason for banning scientists from the Antarctic. The condemnation of tourists for daring to encroach on these wonderful landscapes is equally unacceptable. These are not destinations for the masses. They are too distant and costly, and tolerable only in summer. But anyone, duly supervised, should be allowed to enjoy the wonders of polar regions, as of the world's deserts and forests. Ice is ecologically fragile, but these lands are vast. Besides, the best ambassadors for polar conservation are those who pay good money to see it. An apocalyptic report this week from Brussels bewailed a northwards migration of mankind as the ice caps melt and the tropics become less inhabitable. This is surely a natural balancing of the occupants of planet earth in response to climate change. The mining settlements round the Arctic Circle, the tourists on the Antarctic peninsula and the American base at McMurdo Station are not going to shrink. What is clear is that some new governing framework must be developed to meet these changes, wider in accountability than to Big Science. There is no way national self-interest will be kept at bay unless a stronger body is granted sovereign authority, presumably under the United Nations. Scientists and soldiers simply cannot tell tourists and prospectors to get lost from a chunk of the planet. The beauties and the riches of these regions are increasingly accessible and must be governed for the benefit of all, as should be the skies and the oceans. They are paradises made in hell, but they are no longer unknowable or untouchable. Those days are over.  simon.jenkins@theguardian.com",Simon Jenkins: Scientists and soldiers can no longer keep these paradises to themselves,2008-03-14T14:44:14Z,Simon Jenkins,world
"And so the fall of parliament continues. As evidenced by front-page pieces in the Sun and Daily Mail, today's big story is what the latter calls a ""£22,000 shopping list of luxury goods every MP can buy at your expense"": 38 items for MPs' second homes, whose various expenses limits are based on prices at the supposedly ""upmarket"" department store John Lewis. Martin Bell and the rather pious Lewes Lib Dem MP Norman Baker supply outraged quotes, and there we are: another story about our venal, on-the-make, borderline corrupt legislators, and more fuel for those who'd have you believe that parliamentary democracy is in crisis. The imminent release of MPs' detailed expenses will doubtless send them into an even greater frenzy. If only for a moment, let's pause for breath. With the exception of those who serve constituencies in inner London, MPs are among the few people whose jobs necessarily entail two homes. Like most of the rest of us, I dare say they can function that bit better if they have access to the kind of items on the John Lewis list: beds, bookcases, chairs, dishwashers, fridges, you name it. Carpets are always a nice touch; a desk can often help. And bear in mind: each of the prices quoted is the maximum allowable, and £22,000 is the most they can spend in total. £750 for a ""hi-fi/stereo"" seems a little steep, and £10,00 is a bit too much for a kitchen, but is this really the outrageous story it's being hyped up to be? Of late, what with the speaker's wife's taxi rides, the revelation that MPs could claim £250 in expenses without receipts, the pantomimic intrigue surrounding Derek Conway and various donations stories, the idea that the Commons is a temple of decadence has been reheated again and again. Running along with it, you sense a very British prejudice that unites both the ultra-left and the populist right: that MPs would somehow be all the purer if we stripped them of material well-being and forced them to sit on second-hand sofas (witness that old Trotskyite demand to pay MPs only ""an average workers' wage""). As ever, all of this obscures the issue that no-one will go near: that our MPs are actually among the most poorly-paid, under-resourced legislators in the developed world, their poor reputation at least partly stems from that, and the Commons' absurdly labyrinthine expenses regime is a higgledy-piggledy attempt to try and make up for it. MPs' basic pay currently stands at £60,675 - which, when you consider the hours they put in and the range of responsibilities they have to fulfil, is something of a joke. The average MP's expenses claim - which covers, among other things, staff, office expenses and travel - came in last year at an additional £135,600. In the eyes of their accusers, that seems to make them pampered decadents, but the nitty-gritty of an MP's life suggests that something is still very wrong. A decent-sized office is by no means guaranteed; the supposedly crucial work of holding the government to account is done with minimal support teams made up of low-paid twentysomethings, volunteer interns - and, yes, close relatives. A member of the US House Of Representatives, by contrast, is paid around $170,000 a year - which, prior to the dollar's recent tumble, pointed up an even greater contrast - and can hire up to 18 aides. So, here's a modest proposal, which chimes with tentative suggestions made by MPs about 18 months ago. Pay them £100,000, at least. Drop the numbers of MPs if necessary, and supply them with decently-paid support teams and the necessary office space. On that basis, do away with the more eye-catching aspects of the expenses system - and, just maybe, start to look at the directorships and consultancy jobs that really do give parliament a bad name. The John Lewis list isn't the issue; this stuff really is.",Commons people,2008-03-14T14:30:00Z,John Harris,politics
"Post war chancellors fall into three groups. There are the big beasts - Lawson, Brown, Healey, Cripps - who have been central to their governments, put their stamp on the Treasury and left their mark. There have been the mainstreamers - Jenkins, Howe, Clarke, Macmillan - who have held the fort and surefootedly pushed the economy forwards. And there are the Calamity Janes - Maudling, Barber, Lamont, Callaghan - who have been associated with debacles, lost control and allowed themselves to be dictated to by events or their bosses. Alistair Darling was perilously close to being a Calamity Jane, but this budget is a substantial reassertion of his authority and may allow him to join the mainstreamers. He has managed to find enough cash through taxing ""bads"" like cheap booze or gas-guzzling cars to put borrowing on a well-judged downward course (as long as the economy performs as well as he forecasts, an important qualification), while finding extra money to attack child poverty. He has restated the government's achievements, and set it back on track. Given the constraints he was under, it is more than passable, even if not especially progressive or imaginative. But for the government to succeed, he needs - and Gordon Brown and his party need him - to develop into a big beast and make his own mark at a Treasury that is still on the autopilot left by Brown. He could make himself a chancellor who left an indelible impression by establishing a framework of taxation that emphatically and comprehensively tackled climate change; he could make himself the chancellor who rejuvenated Britain's infrastructure; he could be the ""knowledge economy"" chancellor; or the ""social justice"" chancellor. At the moment, he is none of those. Instead, he is the ""steady-as-she-goes"" chancellor, which, if the economy slides towards a credit crunch-induced recession or the government continues to feel so wooden, will not be enough. But he may feel, after the experience of the last nine months, that just to be in the same company as a Jenkins or a Clarke is sufficient achievement. Events will be the judge of that.

"Well, that was the worst possible outcome for the Democrats - and for all those, in America and beyond, yearning for change after eight failed years of Republican rule. The results of Tuesday's contests in Ohio and Texas promise a slow disaster for the party for whom 2008 should have been an easy and golden year.  Even a week ago, Democrats had March 4 circled on the calendar as the day of closure. Barack Obama did not need to extend his winning streak over the past 11 contests by much, just enough to confirm that the momentum he had built over February - measured in votes, money and top-drawer endorsements - was irreversible. A narrow win in Texas would have done it. Bill Clinton had said as much, noting that if Hillary did not win both of Tuesday's big states, she'd be finished. The party bigwigs would have closed in, tapped Hillary on the shoulder and told her it was time to step aside.  Instead, Hillary Clinton won 51% of the vote in Texas and took Ohio by much more - and she's not about to give way to anybody. This fight will go on. Which means that the Democrats now brace themselves for months more rancour and division, tangled up in a battle with each other. Occasionally, they'll be able to pause from their wrestling, look up from the mud bath and see a smiling John McCain strolling towards November. For the Republicans resolved their nomination fight on Tuesday night, just as Democrats ensured protracted indecision in theirs. McCain now has a clear path before him. He can simply press ahead, framing the general election debate on his own terms and defining himself before his opponent gets a chance to do it for him. Optimistic Democrats see a sunny side to this never-ending saga of primaries and caucuses. For one thing, with the drama all on their side, the media spotlight stays on them. And, say the Pollyannas, it's actually healthy that the Democratic rivals test each other in combat now. It means that the eventual winner will be battle-hardened, their hide thick enough to repel anything McCain and the Republicans hurl their way. After all, if Obama can't beat Clinton - or vice-versa - then how could they hope to beat McCain?  But put down the rose-coloured glasses and another view is possible. For the Clinton camp is sure to conclude that it won on Tuesday by going negative, setting out to rob Obama of his halo. Clinton attacked him for his links to a slum landlord now on trial in Chicago, his apparent double-talk on the North American Free Trade Agreement and, most arrestingly, with a TV commercial featuring sleeping children, which suggested that Obama was simply too inexperienced to deal with a 3am call to the White House warning of a foreign crisis.  Even if Obama had a good response to the TV ad - noting that when the ""red phone"" rang for Hillary in 2003, asking whether America should invade Iraq, she gave the wrong answer - he was clearly knocked off his stride by the Clinton barrage and by the intensified press scrutiny that came with it. That was bad news for him, but it's also bad news for the party as a whole. The ringing phone ad was the kind of scare commercial Republicans habitually run against Democrats, its tone similar to the cold war ""bear in the woods"" ad Ronald Reagan used to crush Walter Mondale in 1984. If Obama is the eventual nominee, McCain will simply have to hit rewind and play it back as his own. The same is true of Hillary's declaration that she and McCain both have long records of national security experience - while all Obama has is ""one speech"". Until now, Obama has avoided hitting back in kind - but now, almost an underdog once more, he may have to. That will mean weeks of hand-to-hand combat over ""ethics and disclosure and law firms and real estate deals"", in the words of Obama strategist David Axelrod. It will mean dredging up Hillary Clinton's Arkansas past as well as probing into the sources of the Clintons' current fortune. Why, for example, has Hillary refused to release her tax return? Obama can start dismantling Hillary's talk of ""experience"", based on her eight years living in the White House: does that make Laura Bush qualified to be president? Such negative campaigning would not only taint Obama, perhaps fatally undermining his claim to embody a new kind of politics; it would also contaminate the entire Democratic effort. Whoever emerges as the nominee will be damaged goods. Republicans will have been handed their attack lines for November and, worse, the Democratic party will have been plunged into a bitterness that may prove impossible to heal in time. An early warning of that came in Tuesday's exit polls: now only four in 10 Democrats say they'll be satisfied with the nominee, whoever it is. A month ago it was seven in 10. That suggests a sullen, defeated chunk of the Democratic faithful will slink off the battlefield come the autumn rather than fight for the winner. If there is a protracted legal battle over the status of delegates from Michigan and - you guessed it - Florida, excluded for breaking party rules but whose inclusion would favour Hillary, then bitterness will turn into toxicity. But that is not the gloomiest thought. For Democrats could be facing a choice between a woman who can win the party nomination but not the presidency and a man who could win the presidency but not his party's nomination. Start with Hillary: it's easy to work out how she could end up as the Democratic standard-bearer. She might win enough over coming weeks to make the delegate count close and she'll brag that she bagged all the big prizes, the New Yorks and Californias, while Obama only got the minnow states. Then it comes down to those party chieftains, the superdelegates who will wield the casting votes. In that contest, twisting arms and calling in long-owed favours, the Clintons would surely beat the newcomer Obama.  Yet not many would bet on Hillary, once nominated, beating McCain. Sure, she has proved her extraordinary resilience. But McCain trumps her on both experience and national security. And the simple presence of her name on the ballot would unite and galvanise Republicans more effectively than anything McCain could say or do himself.  Obama by contrast could reframe the entire contest, presenting McCain as, yes, a great hero - but from an era that has passed. He could tie him to George Bush, running pictures of yesterday's White House endorsement, branding them partners in the disastrous ""Bush-McCain"" war on Iraq. And Obama has showed that he can bring in the young, independent and suburban voters that Democrats need to win.  Yet to have that chance he has to first win the nomination, and that might be harder for him than would be winning the presidency itself. Going negative erodes his defining positive message; doing nothing allows Hillary to paint him as weak, potential snack-food for the waiting wolves of the Republican party. If it comes down to a stalemate to be settled by the Democratic establishment, he begins with an in-built disadvantage. So this is the Democrats' plight. In a year that should be theirs, they are caught between a potential winner who can't seem to win - and a probable loser who just refuses to lose. freedland@theguardian.com",Jonathan Freedland: There's only one winner from this Democratic battle - the Republicans,2008-03-06T00:10:22Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"No matter that the economy is headed for a slowdown and hard working families are anxiously eyeing the future: according to Gordon Brown's speech at last weekend's Labour spring conference, we're now living in the ""age of ambition"". He and his people seem to have clumsily had a go at cribbing from Barack Obama. The language verges on the nonsensical, but you get the idea: Brown is now aiming for ""a Britain where every parent of every child born today can watch them as they sleep and dare to believe that nothing is beyond them realising their potential"". Meanwhile, factional tensions rumble on. Those on the left who once thought that - to paraphrase an Obama-ism - Brown might be what they had been waiting for, are downcast and depressed. According to some rumblings, even influential Brown allies have been dismayed by his cave-in to ministers who want to maintain a Blairite direction. Insiders reckon the loss of Peter Hain has contributed to a change of weather. The zealous James Purnell has been given his head at the Department for Work and Pensions; Caroline Flint and Andy Burnham have been shoved up the ministerial rankings; good old Hazel Blears is reportedly joining them in pushing the PM rightwards. Their agenda boils down as follows: continue the pro-private sector and ""choice""-driven approach to the public services, attempt to out-nasty the Tories on crime and immigration, maintain the idea that an emphasis on ""aspiration"" (or ""ambition"") should sit at the heart of your armoury - and reject anything proposed by the unions or the Labour left as an old-fashioned irrelevance. What is ironic is that it is this strand of the party that is singing tired old tunes. In the latest issue of the avowedly Blairite journal Progress, three articles go back to Southern Discomfort, a 1992 pamphlet by the Labour grandee Giles Radice. Back then, he urged Labour to get its head around ""underlying shifts in popular attitudes"" that had taken root in the south-east and spread, and the song remains the same: Labour, he says in a new piece, ""must show that it understands the concerns of aspirant voters and has answers to their problems."" The key to winning in the south, says the surrounding coverage, is a ""broad-based message"" on crime, ""improving and reforming public services"", and ""addressing the social and economic pressures which accompany mass migration"". Not many people would argue with that, but by way of revealing what they really mean, there are withering references to people supposedly in danger of ignoring ""the lessons of the 1980s"" and thinking that Labour ""simply has to renew its appeal to its disaffected and traditional supporters"". In other words, ignore just about everyone other than Blairite believers, or you face electoral wipe-out. Such is the sound of generals fighting the last war. At its heart is the idea that Labour must speak with two voices, dishing out scraps of old-time religion to its heartlands, and spinning a very different line in the marginals. Close by, you find a self-serving cartoon of the left, in which deluded nostalgists gather round picket-line braziers and long for the thrilling days of Arthur Scargill. Worse still, the argument is absurd: that when the government is simply updating the mantras of the 1990s and so struggling in the polls that scores of MPs fear for their seats, the solution is Blairite business as usual.  Where to even start? While disciples of the ex-PM fixate on what Blair once called ""a few hundred or a few thousand votes"" in southern marginals, research by Labour MP Jon Trickett reveals a more complex picture. Given looming boundary changes, the party establishment has been talking up the importance of such seats as Croydon Central - where plenty of people might be included in the same social categories as Mondeo Man and Worcester Woman, but there are also 9,400 public sector workers, around 32,500 blue-collar employees, and nearly 16,000 voters drawn from what policy wonks call mosaic group E (aka ""urban intellectuals""). In ultra-tight Harlow, currently held by Labour with a majority of 97, blue-collar voters total 37,000, and there are 5,700 public sector employees. Across the country, it's these groups that account for masses of the 4 million-plus votes Labour lost between 1997 and 2005, precious few of which went to the Tories. To point that out isn't to indulge in blinkered core-votery; it simply underlines the sorry electoral pass to which Blair and his ideas came. The most important argument, though, is this. Whereas there was once a divergence of big issues between the heartlands and marginals - essentially, one group of concerns around post-industrial decline, bumping up against another founded on burgeoning popular affluence - the themes Labour should now be stressing apply to both. Some of this, undoubtedly, is down to 10 years of prosperity, and the fact that many of the blighted badlands of the 1980s have belatedly caught up. But much of the new agenda surrounds its flipside, and very modern concerns that have reared up in our enthusiastic embrace of globalisation, and been pointed up by those supposed dinosaurs on the left. Here again the Blairite position teeters into ludicrousness. Progress's articles cite last year's deputy leadership election as the moment when the party began to entertain potentially suicidal thinking. In fact, thanks to the left-leaning outsider, Jon Cruddas - and, to some extent, Hain and Harriet Harman - the meatiest parts of the campaign pushed it towards the political cutting-edge, and such issues as debt, affordable housing and insecurity at work, none of which were on the New Labour radar. Look, for example, at the list of Labour MPs who recently defied the government and voted for new protection for agency workers, an issue that underlies tensions around immigration all over Britain. Among them were MPs representing such seats as Ealing Southall, Oxford East, Hendon and Great Yarmouth. Why do you suppose that was?  Blairism - even without Blair - still seems to be awkwardly poised between naive optimism and an unbecoming nastiness. Contrary to Brown's rhetoric, this feels less like an age of ambition than an era of rising anxiety - and it's the people to his left making most of the intellectual running. Moreover, lurking within their take on new times is something close to a revelation - that the same messages can be rolled out in Purley and Pontypridd, Grimsby and Guildford, and it need not involve Labour losing what remains of its social democratic soul. Relative to the political contortions of the 1990s, I'd call that progress. john.harris@theguardian.com","John Harris: If only it realised, Labour is coming close to a revelation",2008-03-06T00:10:20Z,John Harris,politics
"This week's Russian elections were ""limited"" and ""less than free and fair"", according to western monitors. The last elections in Iraq, by contrast, were ""a triumph for democracy"". The forthcoming elections in Zimbabwe and Iran have been pre-emptively dismissed as a travesty. Those in Pakistan were, by general consent, an affirmation of freedom. Democracies are like two-year-olds: adorable when they belong to you, but you never see them as others do. Downing Street had a problem with the new Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, since the procedure by which he was chosen was little short of feudal. Yet Gordon Brown could hardly slap him on the back as the victor in some great electoral tourney. Medvedev might hit back with a joke about western leaders also being slid into office by friends and predecessors - and at least he had an election of sorts. The British prime minister wisely muttered something noncommittal and put down the phone. We are in the midst of an astonishing festival of elections in countries as diverse as Russia, Pakistan, Iran, Taiwan, Kenya, Georgia, Armenia, Cyprus, Thailand, Serbia, Zimbabwe, Spain and Italy. And then there is the daddy of them all, America's primaries. Only one generalisation can be made of them, that no generalisation applies. Democracy is the new Christianity. It is the chosen faith of western civilisation, and carrying it abroad is the acceptable face of the Crusader spirit. In reinterpreting Tony Blair's interventionism, the foreign secretary, David Miliband, spoke recently of the west's ""mission"" to promote democracy, even by economic and military warfare. With his eyes fixed on Iraq and Afghanistan, Miliband contrived both to assert that ""we cannot impose democratic norms"" and then demand that we do just that. The truth is that neither Blair nor Miliband, nor the rest of us, has any idea of what we are about. We expect far too much of democracy, and of others who claim to espouse it. We treat it as a rigid set of rules from which no wavering is tolerable. The ballot is a sacred rite and any contamination is blasphemy. We incant the Nicene creed when we should stick to the Sermon on the Mount. Let us upend the customary analysis. At one extreme stands an ideal: democracy as the full table d'hôte of secret ballots, civil rights, a free press, freedom of assembly, balance of power and discretionary local government. It applies in pathetically few states, even in the supposedly democratic west. Menken reasonably dismissed it as ""a dream, to be put in the same category as Arcadia, Santa Claus and Heaven"". At the other, more crowded extreme is a rough and ready electoral process exerting some form of restraint on a ruling elite. One of Africa's nastiest dictators, Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe, regards as a genuine threat the electoral challenge of his former finance minister, Simba Makoni, in an election Mugabe feels he cannot avoid. In Kenya what is significant is not that the leadership rigged an election but that the outcome was denied popular consent, and order collapsed as a result. The same happened in Serbia in 2000. Even Hugo Chávez, hero of Venezuela, had to concede defeat last autumn after a referendum denied his bid to rule for life. Likewise Pakistan's military dictator, Pervez Musharraf, felt obliged to hold reasonably open elections, despite the likelihood that they would lead to his downfall. In Iran, thoroughly polluted elections still threaten to undermine the president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who is milking the popularity bonanza America has handed him in Iraq. In all these cases some ideal of democracy is exerting its mystic force. Even where consent is presumed, as in Russia, the ballot is the ghost in the machine. It is the ultimate legitimiser, the point to which all power aspires and from which it measures its own backsliding. Russia's elections were imperfect, their casual and crude corruption by Vladimir Putin yet another way of displaying his autocratic machismo. He may have failed to live up to the standards the west ""expects"". But he appears to have correctly read the mood of his people, who simply want a strong hand on the wheel for as long as possible. I cannot see what purpose is therefore served by hurling abuse at these states. Russia's path to political emancipation is tentative, if not in reverse. That country has never ticked more than a handful of democracy's boxes, yet is still incomparably freer than under communism. Its pastiche of monopoly capitalism - Putin's ""managed democracy"" - so contrasts with the chaos of the 1990s that even sophisticated Russians tell western interviewers that they would happily buy stability and discipline at the expense of another such gamble. We can tell them they are wrong until the cows come home. But we did not live in Russia in the 1990s. Western leaders, as they beat a cringing path to the door of China's dictators, buy this argument from Beijing. Why do they expect Moscow to behave differently? The famous ""raising of human rights issues"" by western visitors to China, before talking hard cash, now has the familiarity of a tea ceremony. It is these same leaders who, having destroyed order in Iraq and Afghanistan, hail them as democracies when in reality they are anarchies, failed states. To vote for a ruler in a fortress is not to participate in a democracy. There is just no point in the sonorous moralising of western NGOs characterised by the (normally admirable) Human Rights Watch. It complains that ""by allowing autocrats to pose as democrats, without demanding they uphold the civil and political rights that make democracy meaningful, influential democrats risk undermining human rights"".  What are these words ""allowing ... demanding ... undermining""? Their major premise is not just western superiority, to which I might subscribe, but western potency and, most extraordinary (and illegal), a western right to global sovereignty. The assumption behind ""demand"" has lain at the root of so much useless bloodshed over the past half century that a sense of history might surely counsel humility. And this from a Europe whose rulers in Brussels propose using opinion polls as the basis for their legislative legitimacy, without a peep of complaint from democracy's self-appointed guardians. Democracy is an invitation to hypocrisy. Let us practise it ourselves and, if we must preach, preach by example.simon.jenkins@theguardian.com",Simon Jenkins: Democracy is ill served by its self-appointed guardians,2008-03-05T01:48:48Z,Simon Jenkins,world
"Best news this week is that traffic police in Timisoara, Romania, are to have ballet lessons. Videos revealed an ""awkwardness and lack of elegance"" in their movements, confusing drivers and impairing road safety. Their instructor in pirouettes and pliés claims that Swan Lake offers the best role model, a nuance lost on me. Sadly, the police would not be wearing tutus but will perform in standard-issue uniforms. Traffic police have long gone out of fashion in British cities. They have been replaced by technology, otherwise known as traffic lights. The common assumption is that this constitutes an advance, a machine being invariably better than a human. This is untrue. Cut to Professor John Adams of University College London. Meeting Adams is to feel like an Inquisitor grappling with Galileo. He persists in rejecting received wisdom. In his virtual world, white is black, mad is sane and the Earth is round, when everyone knows it is flat. Among other things, Adams has long regarded seat belts and crash helmets as lethal, a menace to public safety. They raise the personal risk threshold and, while making the wearer safer as he drives faster, cause more injury to others. Needless to say, Adams has figures to prove it. He also thinks traffic lights should be banned, along with stop signs, zebra crossings, kerbstones and railings. The reason is not that he is a libertarian nutcase but that they kill people. Traffic lights force drivers to watch and obey robots rather than other road users - an obedience not enforced to the same degree on pedestrians, skateboarders or cyclists. One result is that zebra crossings are dangerous because drivers are no longer used to eye contact with other road users. Technology makes them drive like zombies. Traffic lights, like one-way systems, are also hopelessly inefficient allocators of road space. Even in London's busiest streets, half the tarmac is vacant, waiting for a light to release vehicles on to it. Many British streets are so empty they might as well have shops and houses built over them. We build over countryside but treat roads as sacred. The concept of traffic-light removal is simple. It is that all users of public space adjust their behaviour to that of others, balancing a measure of danger and risk in return for convenience. Drivers undirected by signs, kerbs or road markings are faced with confusion and ambiguity. Since they do not want to cause accidents at junctions, or damage their cars, they reduce their speed and establish eye contact with other users. I recently watched the result of a traffic-light failure in London's Portland Place. Two things happened. One was that drivers opened their eyes and scrutinised other drivers and pedestrians as the intersection became like an American ""flashing amber"". The other was that traffic flowed steadily over the crossing without being held for minutes while nothing moved. Drivers instinctively policed the crossing and rationed the road space on their own. While the concept is not universally applicable, for instance on access to main arteries, it is no longer radical. Across the world, except in Britain, the so-called shared space movement preaches that urban streets should be redesigned for use by all and sundry, motor vehicles weaving their way along them as best they can with chicanes and other devices offering relative protection to pedestrians. The concept has long been familiar in Italy's historic towns. It has been introduced, at the last count, in 3,500 zones in Germany and the Netherlands, 300 in Japan, 600 in Israel, and in cities as widespread as Lyon, Barcelona, Copenhagen, Melbourne and Portland, Oregon. All have experienced a drop in accidents, and most a drop in journey times. At the now celebrated lights-free Laweiplein intersection in Drachten in the Netherlands, the chief danger is from crowds of foreign experts watching incredulously as traffic merges with pedestrians and separates, unaided by robots. Why has the concept not caught on in Britain? The reason is simple. Policy is in the hands of traffic engineers. These people deal with road builders, kit manufacturers, consultants and health and safety inspectors. All have large budgets and a vested interest in treating streets as policed corridors of total control. To them, traffic management involves herding pedestrians into cages and hurling vehicles along fast, one-way streets to bring them to a halt at the next stop light or traffic bump. As a result, road users in cars and on foot in Britain are probably having to travel twice as far as necessary to get from A to B, with controlled crossings and cars negotiating tortuous one-way systems with long waits at lights. This increases traffic volume, causes more accidents, misallocates road space, slows buses and doubles carbon emissions. It is plain dumb. British traffic engineering is stuck in the dark ages, covered in woad and chanting runes about ""gridlock"". One of the few progressive councils in Britain, London's Kensington and Chelsea, has bold politicians leading from the front. The deputy leader, Daniel Moylan, studied shared space abroad and designated Kensington High Street as an experiment (as if it needed one). Railings and crossings were removed. Pedestrians were encouraged to cross where they chose. Bicycle racks were placed on the central reservation. The whole street was tidied. The effect over two years has been a dramatic cut in accidents, down 44% against a London average of 17%. Pedestrians and wheelchair users are no longer dragooned behind railings. Drivers have slowed and pedestrians look at drivers rather than traffic lights. Moylan did not have the courage to remove all lights, but perhaps that will come with the extension of the scheme to Exhibition Road. The experience has been a success. What pushed the Kensington High Street scheme was an eagerness by businesses to make their street more attractive against competition from malls. They wanted, as Moylan puts it, ""to get away from the idea that streetscape is essentially an exercise in safety engineering"". His latest report tells of the need to overrule health and safety officials, who seemed uninterested in evidence that accidents would fall. As for engineers in general, they seem to care only about ""making it harder for road accident victims to bring successful litigation against highway authorities"". Because of this opposition, Moylan is gloomy about his efforts being imitated elsewhere in Britain. The pro-accident vested interest is too strong. Like Adams, he thinks officialdom would rather people died than admit it was wrong. Certainly the concept of people and vehicles sharing the road, and thus rendering it safer and more efficient, is counter-intuitive, because vehicles are regarded as inanimate thugs that do more damage than bicycles and pedestrians. But vehicles are driven by people with eyes, who only become dangerous when treated as automatons. That is why shared space has saved thousands of lives across Europe in the past decade. It also saves pollution, time, money and policing costs. It is a no-brainer. In Britain the flat-earthers deny evidence and cry that the great god traffic would ""grind to a halt"" if streets were shared and traffic lights were abolished. Yet as Galileo told the Inquisition, ""Eppur si muove"", and yet it moves. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com",Simon Jenkins: Rip out the traffic lights and railings.

"I agree that there should be sufficient midwives to meet the obstetric needs of the women in this country, and I agree that those midwives should be paid in line with their extremely high level of skill within the nursing profession. On almost every other matter relating to childbirth, I find myself opposed to the prevailing maternity trend in this country.  I do not agree that ""medicalisation"" is a bad thing in labour, or that ""communication"" and ""quality, one-to-one support of a midwife"" (I'm quoting from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines) are any kind of substitute for pain relief. It makes my blood boil when I read that ""epidurals can slow labour down"" (from the BBC website, but you will hear that from almost every source), as if the figures are mysterious and unknowable, when studies have shown that epidurals slow each phase of labour by about 20 minutes.  I could write a symphony on how irrelevant 20 minutes is when you're not in pain, compared with how unbearably long it is when you are. But many women do insist on anti-medicalised, scented candle-style birthing experience, and the last thing anyone needs either before or during labour is to be bullied, so I am resolved to stay out of the entire debate. What I cannot let go, however, is the latest reporting on the shortage of midwives. The government is seeking to attract 4,000 more midwives to the NHS because there is a shortage. At the weekend, it appeared in the Telegraph that the ""huge rise in caesareans"" was down to hospitals ""struggling to cope with the rising numbers of older mothers, obese women and IVF patients requiring extra attention"". In the Mail, on Monday, this was repeated.  This is statistical analysis so poor that it can only be wilfully mendacious. Technically, it is true that there are more older mothers, more of us of all ages are obese, and IVF brings about more multiple births. But let's just go through it, quickly - the birth rate went up by 11% between 2000 and 2006. That is a difference of 63,000 births in a year. The number of midwives has declined, and now stands at 18,862 full-timers. This is why the average maternity unit has 31 midwives per 1,000 deliveries rather than the recommended 36.  Now review the numbers of the problematically obese - the evidence that the overweight are burdening the system is that 15% of maternal deaths in this period were among the morbidly fat. But maternal deaths stand at about 300 per year, in this early-noughties period, 15% of which is 45 women. Of course, they've already got their just deserts for the outrageous crime of fatness - being dead. But to claim that this is where the extra stress on maternity services lies - when there are 63,000 more births a year and no compensatory rise in midwives - is just absurd.  As for mothers getting older: on average the age of women giving birth in 2004 was 29.4, as opposed to 28.4 in 1994. The amount of IVF is around 1% of all births, and of those only the multiple births are riskier at the point of delivery - and they account for 25% of IVF, that is 0.25% of all births.  You could take all the obese mothers and all the IVF multiple births in the country, and they wouldn't add up to the extra pressure of a higher birthrate in one primary care trust. It is simply maddening - it's like blaming caffeine-withdrawal for a headache when you've just been shot in the face. There is a relentless drive to make women culpable for the way the health service fails us, when the only way we could possibly be blamed is that, collectively, too many of us are having babies.  Even taking a background of misogyny as given, these groundless accusations - in a nutshell, ""you're too old, you're too feckless, you're too fat, you deserve what's coming"" - just beggar belief. mszoewilliams@yahoo.co.uk",Zoe Williams: Off message on maternity,2008-02-27T00:18:46Z,Zoe Williams,society
"After bumping about the lower end of the human development index for a few years, Sierra Leone again arrived at the bottom last November: 177th out of 177. Introducing its latest figures, the United Nations Development Programme explained how a combination of factors, including life expectancy, education and standard of living, helps establish whether a country provides 'an environment in which people can develop their full potential and lead productive, creative lives in accord with their needs and interests'. Life expectancy in Sierra Leone is 40. On the plus side, Sierra Leone has miles of fantastic beaches, which score highly for all key seaside indicators, among them white sand, crystalline water and the all-important relaxation factor. 'With some of the most perfect palm-lined sands on the continent,' the Lonely Planet guide to Africa confirms, 'it won't be long before Sierra Leone takes its place in Europe's packaged beach-holiday scene.'  To this end, airline BMI has announced that an increased number of flights between London and Freetown will start in May, with its CEO Nigel Turner assuring the newcomers to the resort (recently likened by one writer to a 'stinking refugee camp'): 'One always needs to be careful, but you need to be careful in Brixton, frankly.' You certainly do and if it is early days to make Brixton a separate entry in the human development index, it is surely time the Foreign and Commonwealth Office began issuing guidance reminding visitors to the region to exercise caution. Or they could avoid the area altogether. As the Lonely Planet guide reminds visitors to Freetown, with its traffic jams, rubbish and power cuts, 'if you spend all your time in the tourist-focused areas, you'll rarely encounter those problems'. There can be no guarantee, however, that the visitor will not, from time to time, be confronted by potentially distressing evidence of human suffering, even if most of Freetown can be successfully shunned. Some 6,000 of those who survived the civil war are terribly mutilated, their limbs hacked off by Revolutionary United Front gangs. Are such sights consonant with two weeks of blissful rest? The Lonely Planet guide is soothing: 'Most locals hang on to their optimism.' Then again, that might have been written when Sierra Leone was still number 176. But such fortitude in the face of adversity will be familiar to more experienced travellers, whose reports from ill-starred, faraway places invariably stress the tremendous good cheer of people who have, on the face of it, little to look forward to beyond privation, illness and death. Even in Brixton, they report, it is common to see the most deprived children laughing happily as they enjoy a refreshing fag or sip from a cooling alcopop. As for the travellers: one can only marvel at their resolute commitment to their holidays, undiminished by boycotts, wars, climate change and anything else that consistency, decency and good taste can throw at them. Few of us, for instance, may want to visit Sudan just now, but a quick internet shop brings up a variety of leisured challenges to genocide, from a Sudan camel trek (16 days, from £2,959), to Responsible Travel's Nuba People and Villages (15 days, from £2,400). 'Sudan is an emerging destination for adventurous travellers,' says the company, which prides itself on low carbon footprints and a principled approach: 'The tribes we meet have no idea of tourism and we have a huge responsibility when exposing them to a different culture.' If somebody is going to introduce Nuban tribespersons to the benefits of Rohan's Dynamic Moisture Control, we should perhaps be grateful that the emissaries supplied by Responsible Travel are likely to be ever so ethical, long accustomed to weighing up the arguments for and against their foreign trips before they decide to go on them anyway. Since Aung San Suu Kyi declared, in 1996, that to visit Burma under the junta was to condone its regime, informed tourists have hardly been able to avoid wondering if the benefits of their own presence, complete with a copy of Ian McEwan's Saturday and lots of money, can really compensate for endorsing tyrants, in Burma or anywhere else. For the confused, Lonely Planet's guide to Burma still offers a summary of this 'debate', along with the conclusion that tourists do the oppressed a favour, by offering 'outside contact'. Inevitably, the success of this outreach work is hard to evaluate. Is it even necessary? In North Korea, where Amnesty reports continued 'systematic violations of human rights', a tour operator tells customers: 'Far from being downtrodden and disconsolate, you will be welcomed by our guide amongst the merry faces untroubled by worries of money and crime.'  Equally, should we introduce Western values to the citizens of Belarus and risk damaging what another operator depicts as perfectly preserved Soviet charm? 'If you are interested in experiencing what is one of the last remaining havens of the ""good old days"" when the Iron Curtain separated Europe into two camps, then Belarus can provide it in spades.' For the truly concerned traveller, interested in experiencing authentic communism, dictatorship or abject poverty, it's clearly far better to emulate a visitor getting close to a turtle in the Galápagos Islands: respectfully approaching the different form of life without upsetting nature's delicate balance in any way. As Krishna Pujari, who first encouraged poorists to view the Mumbai slums, once put it: 'We want to show tourists the reality of Dharavi and change any negative ideas they might have about this slum. We respect the privacy of the residents of Dharavi and ensure that the tour does not disturb them in any way.' With human rights out of the way, resourceful tourists are now proving that ecological objections, which had not even surfaced in 1996, are equally unlikely to threaten their right to travel now. Just as arguments about cruel regimes encouraged some tourists to portray themselves as liberators in shorts, complaints about carbon emissions have merely prompted a new generation to reinvent themselves as the most self-righteous trippers in history, swapping gripes about M&S packaging on the flight to Papua New Guinea. 'Does anyone have any ideas about the best way to dispose of recyclables/other rubbish over there?' queries a contributor to Lonely Planet's Thorn Tree travel forum, anxious about garbage arrangements in Dharamsala. Posting on another forum, a traveller offers tips for saving plastic: 'When flying, bring an empty plastic bottle.' So perhaps that famous Sierra Leonean optimism is well placed. So long as greener travellers do not boycott its shoddy recycling system, there is no reason why the white sands beyond Freetown should not, as predicted, soon be darkened by tides of ethical sunbathers. Assuming, of course, the beaches can survive the inundation expected from climate change. But even then, all is not lost. As any ethical tour operator can tell you, these days tsunamis and melting icecaps are seen not so much as unalleviated catastrophes as sustainable holidays you haven't yet taken.","Catherine Bennett: Trips to war-torn countries are smug, not ethical",2008-02-24T10:47:39Z,Catherine Bennett,world
"First David Cameron sullies thousands of people's memories by boasting of his love of the Smiths, and now this. According to the Evening Standard's Anne McElvoy, those fast-rising, 40-ish politicians who are defining more and more of the Westminster weather belong to the ""Jam Generation"", which allegedly had its formative experiences soundtracked by the trio commanded by the young Paul Weller. Last week, she began to explain all this at the tail end of Radio 4's The Westminster Hour. The theory goes like this. High achievers such as Davids Cameron and Miliband, Nick Clegg, Yvette Cooper and Ruth Kelly came to political awareness in the early 1980s. Those on the left experienced long years of loss, whereas their right-leaning peers gleefully watched as Thatcher did her worst, before John Major lost his bearings. And now look: propelled by their respective defeats into the supposed centre-ground, they now trade in what McElvoy calls ""soft contour"" politics - that middle-of-the-road mulch that leads people to drone on about opportunity, social justice and academies for all. The lines drawn from all this to the Jam aren't clear cut, but still: between 1979 and their break-up in 1982, they were the intelligent young Briton's rock group of choice, and McElvoy claims to hear the odd echo of modern political themes in Weller's old lyrics. She quotes, for instance, the 1979 hit-cum-treatise When You're Young: ""It's got you in its grip before you're born / It's done with the use of a dice and a board / They let you think you're king, but you're really a pawn."" That was meant as a snarling blast against class inequality, but it's recast here as the first stirrings of the latterday drive for ""meritocracy"" and social mobility.  To indulge McElvoy's typology and speak as a member of the Jam Generation's younger element (I was almost 13 when they split up, but treasured their records long after), I'd nail our essential worldview-predicament as follows. Old enough to just about remember Britain's period of hobbled social democracy but decisively shaped by Thatcherism, we're still troubled by vague recollections of a society that might not have been that efficient, but had a collectivist spirit that disappeared in front of our eyes. Moreover, a lot of us suspect that today's centre ground looks worryingly like the hard-right territory of yesteryear - and that within that turnaround lurks the triumph of the avaricious forces who rubbed their hands as Thatcher got to work. Or, as Weller put it in 1981's Funeral Pyre: ""Their mad eyes bulged, their flushed faces said / The weak get crushed, as the strong grow stronger.""  Whatever he was singing, it all surely pointed towards something a little different from the comfy inanities of post-Blairism. At first, Weller's political instincts tended to resolve themselves in a bitter resignation, not least when it came to the idea that nothing - as plenty of the new political breed can attest - ensures success like an expensive education (witness 1979's Eton Rifles: ""All that rugby puts hairs on your chest / What chance have you got against a tie and a crest?""). By the time the Jam broke up, his dissent had turned socialist, as you can hear in Trans-Global Express, a brave attempt to pitch Marxism to Smash Hits readers: ""Governments threaten you with recession, then they threaten you with war / How the other side wants to take away / All the things you ain't got no more.""  ""It meant a lot, some of those Jam albums we used to listen to,"" said David Cameron. As my mind boggled at visions of class rage echoing through the dorms, I was rather reminded of a handwritten cue card that crops up in the video for 1982's Town Called Malice: ""If we ain't getting through to you, you obviously ain't listening."" john.harris@theguardian.com",John Harris: All political mod cons,2008-02-23T00:04:50Z,John Harris,politics
"This government is nationalisation crazy. It has nationalised not just a bank but the tabloid press. The Diana inquest, which today enters cloud cuckoo land with Mohamed al-Fayed's evidence, is the most obscene farrago in British jurisprudence. It is judges, lawyers and justice officials plunging their snouts into £2m of public funds to play gutter journalism. They are clearly intoxicated by giving celebrity publicity to allegations that do not merit the light of day. And why? For money. It is now over a year since Lord Stevens spent three years and £4m on an 832-page report (pdf) on the death of the mother of the heir to the throne, by then a private citizen. He concluded that the car crash in Paris was an accident. In this he agreed with the French police inquiry. The driver of the princess's car was driving far too fast and was drunk. Stevens ""hoped this would bring closure"". The technical requirement that a Briton's death abroad requires a formal inquest would have been met by a one-day hearing following the Stevens report. Instead the public and the princess's family must watch a four-month spectacular at the Royal Courts of Justice inquiring into one thing alone, the desperate claim of Fayed that the deaths of his son and the princess 10 years ago were due to a murder conspiracy by the British royal family. In this ridiculous cause, members of the royal family were summoned, but wisely declined. Courtiers, friends of the princess and others have been traipsing through the highest court in the land, discussing pregnancy tests, contraception, gynaecology, putative engagements and crackpot murder theories by spies and the Duke of Edinburgh. A jury with QCs cross-examining witnesses is wholly unusual for a coroner's hearing. It is rather a Max Clifford stage set, distressing for the princess's children and humiliating for almost all the participants but a licence to run for the tabloids. Even Paul Burrell, who has made a career from being the princess's butler, seems to have found the business distasteful. Yet on it goes under the benign gaze of Lord Justice Scott Baker - not, please note, a mere local coroner - seemingly without end. It is like the Bloody Sunday inquiry in Northern Ireland that is still not over. The only hope is that Fayed, in whose cause this play is being enacted, might be prevailed upon to pay the costs. The reputation of the Royal Courts of Justice is beyond such repair. I hope I never again hear a judge criticising the tabloid press.",A travesty of justice,2008-02-18T12:30:00Z,Simon Jenkins,uk
"The choice, a leading liberal figure in the arts world solemnly told me, is between fairness and prosperity. Britain can choose to tax the worldwide income of its non-domiciled rich in the name of equity, but it will suffer calamities varying from a City of London brain drain to the collapse of donations to our great art galleries. Or it can choose prosperity. Thus his decision to join a City-inspired campaign to warn publicly against Alistair Darling's proposed taxation proposals. In its selfishness, the City's move is eerily reminiscent of Arthur Scargill's National Union of Mineworkers' insistence that all that matters is mining. And last week, the non-dom super-rich could claim a partial victory. The government was not even going to consult on subjecting the more than £120bn held in their overseas trusts to potential taxation; it would withdraw the proposals immediately. The media exulted amid headlines of a U-turn. Darling, fresh from being jeered at a City dinner and retreating on his proposals on capital gains tax, was now in retreat again. His judgment and job were in doubt; Ed Balls understood City concerns better. He should become Chancellor before the summer. In reality, Darling is holding some ground; he will still introduce a £30,000 levy on the worldwide income of the non-doms if they have lived in Britain for seven years. The Treasury, despite its 'U-turn', comforts itself that while it has made some corrections to both the levy and to its increases in effective capital gains tax, the essence is intact and so, importantly, is most of the projected tax revenue. But the bigger picture is more worrying. The Chancellor and Treasury are losing the wider argument, if they are making one at all. Too many people, not just on the right but in the moderate centre, share the view that taxation is not legitimate if it threatens 'prosperity' and are buying the City/business line that even moderate capital gains tax, corporation tax, inheritance tax and gently progressive income tax are obstacles to 'enterprise'. Taxation is increasingly only legitimate if it taxes something 'bad' - environmental pollution or cheap alcohol. The first principle of the British taxation system must be to keep the rich, business and the City happy, the toiling geese that lay the golden egg of prosperity. The self-righteousness and increasing self-confidence of these people is astonishing. The Worshipful Company of International Bankers invited the Chancellor to its dinner at London's Mansion House two weeks ago. Darling made a routine speech in which he genuflected ritually to the importance of the City. The Lord Mayor then responded by chiding him over City regulation and the taxation of non-doms, but it was the mockery of Henry Angest, deputy master of the Worshipful Company, a treasurer of the Conservative party and right-wing Rottweiler, that provoked the 450 diners into banging their tables and jeering. It could not have happened without an extraordinary sense of entitlement and self-worth. These international bankers really believe they uniquely contribute to the wealth of the nation. It is an article of faith that they have an inalienable moral right to design their affairs so that all but a trivial amount of their earnings is held offshore to escape British taxation, despite the fact that many of them are de facto British residents. They are simply wrong, as Darling should have told the Worshipful Company and Mr Angest. Residency is a privilege that comes with attendant obligations. We rightly expect poor immigrants to learn to speak English as part of the contract of residency. Equally, we should expect the foreign rich to pay taxes as part of the same contract; indeed, the concession that we should wait seven years before making this demand is generous, offered by no other country, including the USA. Nor should we connive in offshore trusts designed to avoid such obligations, but that pass has now been sold. We should not want to force the super-rich to leave because they are rich: that is self-defeating. A healthy society requires the rich as potential patrons of the arts, social benefactors and economic innovators and as plural counterweights to the state. But a healthy society requires everyone to contribute, with no one part of its economy - miners or international bankers - being privileged over another. If the cost of that is that some leave, so be it. Of the 114,000 non-doms, the Treasury estimates 3,000 might go, hardly an exodus even if they receive a one-sided avalanche of publicity. Most will want to continue to enjoy the buzziest city in the world and its still low taxation rather than hazard the Calvinist stillness of Switzerland or the narrow confines of Monaco. They will even carry on giving to the arts. Nor is the City the sole pillar on which Britain's prosperity depends. It is part of a wider phenomenon, a boom in the services that Britain sells the world. Industries as disparate as advertising, architecture, educational publishing, software, design, television production, environmental services, universities and research hospitals have been surfing the same opportunities provided by globalisation and, as the statistics show, are doing much, much better in generating jobs, exports and wealth than financial services.  Nor do their executives plead for non-dom status, vastly overpay themselves and distort the London labour and housing market. Nor does their extravagant recklessness, incentivised by absurd bonuses, threaten to create a potential credit crunch that might topple the Western economy into recession. Everyone - from credulous BBC interviewers to awed policy-makers - needs to treat City claims about its unique wonderfulness with more scepticism. Our politicians may be braver about making these arguments if there were others in civil society showing support. The TUC's Brendan Barber weighed in last week, but he would be infinitely more forceful if he spoke for a legitimate, growing and intellectually coherent trade union movement. He does not and we are all the weaker.  We need the City and the rich, but we need them to accept obligations along with their privileges. That requires argument and a wider culture that holds them to account, regarding paying tax as a civic obligation. In their absence, we have what we witnessed last week, with even the arts establishment arguing for non-dom privileges. It is not a pretty sight.",Will Hutton: Let's demolish some of these myths about the City,2008-02-17T00:09:27Z,Will Hutton,politics
"This summer's Beijing Olympics have become another Long March. After the great leap forward, the cultural revolution and a thousand flowers blooming, the people's republic must confront Steven Spielberg's refusal to choreograph its Olympic opening ceremony. He is unlikely to stop the politburo in its tracks. But where democracy is absent, celebrity is all. Mia Farrow taunted Spielberg in the Wall Street Journal as the Leni Riefenstahl of the ""genocide Olympics"". An appalled Spielberg resigned as artistic adviser, accusing the Chinese of not doing enough ""to end the appalling suffering in Darfur"". China's rulers are presumably meant to quake, staring in despair into their mint tea. What can this mean? What if Angelina Jolie taunts George Clooney? What if Barbra Streisand taunts Tom Cruise? What - merciful Confucius - if Woody Allen taunts Amy Winehouse? Tectonic plates will shift beneath the Forbidden City. In my experience most artists do not care much about politics so long as the money is right. Architects such as Zaha Hadid and Norman Foster build monuments, indeed entire cities, to flatter the fancies of Asian dictators. Musicians perform for Omani sheikhs. Artists adorn the walls of Dubai. Spielberg doubtless felt honoured to serve the Beijing Olympics and dust them with the glamour of his calling, until the heat was on in Hollywood. I hate boycotts of all sorts. They hurt the wrong people and rarely work, so I am basically on the artists' side. Art elevates the human spirit, and money lubricates the wheels of change. But a world of difference separates a boycott from sycophantic assistance. If a Chinese communist offered me a crock of gold to write, say, a eulogistic blurb in the Olympics programme, I could not imagine saying yes. These people may be an improvement on their Maoist predecessors, but I would not give them the time of day, let alone take their money. The Olympics are not essentially about sport, the sports being almost all ""minor"" ones. The longstanding ploy of the International Olympic Committee in inflating the nationalist significance of the games and thus sustaining the extravagance of the spectacle has made them what Hitler intended, a grotesque display of chauvinism that only the richest states can play. Britain's Olympics minister, Tessa Jowell, with Tony Blair in attendance, went close to berserk in Singapore in 2005 to ""win the games for Britain"". The winning was spun as a triumph for Blair's Britain. How else could £9bn of public money be justified for two weeks of elite sport, a large chunk of it for handling just the opening and closing ceremonies? When Sir Craig Reedie, Britain's IOC member, told the press that ""the IOC is a sports organisation and its contract is with the host city, it does not become involved in politics"", he was talking nonsense. It is essentially involved in politics. Contracts are underwritten by the Chinese and British governments and the games are drenched in national prestige. Popular sports such as soccer, cricket and rugby do not require ministerial support or huge public outlays. Mia Farrow's comparison of Beijing with the 1936 Berlin Olympics is not out of order. These are the most political games since then. They were fashioned - and awarded by the IOC - specifically on the basis that if the Chinese squandered enough money, they would be accepted into the community of tolerable nations. They have destroyed swaths of Beijing, evicted thousands of people and sucked some $35bn in public expenditure from a country still mired in appalling poverty and oppression. There is no sign of the promised improvement in human rights. Ever since then, George Bush, Nicolas Sarkozy and Gordon Brown with his ""business leaders"" have beaten a cringing path to China's door. Democracy campaigners are thrown into jail. The BBC will blow £1m on a 150-staff junket to promote the games, even as China censors its website. If you are running a fascist state, the Olympics are worth every penny. In 1980 Britain blatantly acknowledged the political status of the Olympics by refusing ""officially"" to attend the Moscow games but allowing its athletes to compete ""as individuals"". The decision was in protest at the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan the previous year. If, as Gordon Brown intends, British troops are still in occupation of that same country in 2012, he can hardly complain if Russia and others find an excuse to return the compliment and boycott the London games. I imagine we have seen nothing yet of the politics of Beijing 2008. Jowell displayed a note of panic on Wednesday in declaring that a boycott of the games would be ""counterproductive"". Why should it be more counterproductive than the Moscow protest? And did she not support a sports boycott of South Africa, and a cricket boycott of Zimbabwe? She claimed that a boycott ""would not serve any purpose and would be a great pity"". She added weakly that whenever she goes to Beijing, which is almost every year, she ""raises issues surrounding"" human rights. The reality is that, despite pleas from eight Nobel peace laureates this week to use the games as a lever on Darfur, Britain rejects any call for a boycott - not least from the Justice and Equality Movement, which represents the rebel groups in Sudan. Another argument against boycotts is that they invite such hypocrisy. Andy Burnham, the new culture secretary, is perhaps closer to the mark in remarking that ""you cannot make a clean separation between representative sport and the situation in any particular country"". But on this score Darfur is hardly the worst of China's political sins, its alliance with Sudan being chiefly the result of its thirst for oil. Tibet, human rights and internet censorship have yet to raise their cantankerous heads. The Olympic movement has shielded the games from criticism for seven years as the Chinese poured billions of dollars into the IOC's beloved concrete. The British Olympic Association, presumably after consultation with ministers, outrageously tried to ban British athletes from making political statements. When the Chinese police start beating up athletes, journalists and activists this August, where will Brown, Burnham and Jowell stand: for liberty and human rights, or for the semi-laundered tyrants of Tiananmen Square? It is scarcely credible that a British government should find itself defending the Chinese in such an argument. This is the mess you get into when you mix sport with politics. At the Moscow Olympics, athletes from the 16 boycotting nations paraded under the Olympic flag in a gesture against the politicising of the games. When they won medals they wanted no national anthems. Needless to say, the IOC looked askance at this, since its future extravagance depended on sustaining chauvinist hysteria. The only answer, given the rampant politicising of these games, is to regard them as a festival of politics as well as of sport and civil engineering. Having awarded China's communist regime the accolade of the publicity, the world should howl its contempt for its behaviour. Otherwise those present can hardly deny that they are lending their names and their talents to glorify the world's greatest dictatorship. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com",Simon Jenkins: Olympics is festival of politics worth every penny to fascist states,2008-02-15T00:27:21Z,Simon Jenkins,politics
"David Miliband loves democracy. We all love democracy. We also love capitalism, social welfare, child health, book learning and leatherback turtles. We would like the whole world to love them too, and we stand ready to persuade it so. But do we shoot anyone who refuses? It is hardly credible that two centuries since Immanuel Kant wrestled with this oldest of ethical conundrums, a British government still cannot tell the difference between espousing a moral imperative and enforcing one. Yesterday in Oxford the foreign secretary decided to update the 1998 Chicago speech of his then mentor, Tony Blair, in which Blair tore up the UN's sovereignty provisions in favour of the new ""liberal interventionism"". He proposed a doctrine of international community, which he claimed, like St Teresa, to have ""witnessed"". This required Britain to attack sovereign states unprovoked if this would end a violation of human rights. Blair qualified his zeal with reference to military feasibility, a ""readiness for long-term commitment"" and ""our national interest truly engaged"". Like any interference in the lives of others, the motives were soon mixed and the language confused. How feasible is feasible? How long is long term? What is an ""engaged"" national interest: a moral crusade or an arms deal? Nonetheless, as Kosovo and Sierra Leone were to show, Blair was right to acknowledge a humanitarian instinct beyond relieving the starving, as in Biafra or Ethiopia. In 1993 the liberal Washington Post was goading the US to invade Somalia, since states that ""treat their peoples badly"" should lose the protection of the UN charter's protection. Such unilateral rewriting ended in tears, but this did nothing to halt the exhilarating ""virtues imperialism"" of many on the left and right. Miliband brushes aside the blundering into Iraq and Afghanistan as errors of implementation rather than principle and takes the Blair doctrine into new territory. He wants his pan-democratic world to be achieved by peaceful means, by trade, multilateral action and - his new soundbite - a ""civilian surge"". Should soft power fail, Miliband wants to use sanctions and send in troops, for instance through offering security guarantees to regimes that ""abide by democratic rules"". Such measures would need to embrace internal and external security, and be of universal application if, as Kant warned, they are to go beyond opportunism and carry moral force. They would have guaranteed Dubcek's Czechoslovakia against the Soviet Union, and Allende's Chile against America. The regimes in Baghdad and Kabul would need guarantees indefinitely, as would an elected regime in Pakistan - guaranteeing it against insurgent Taliban and lurking generals. Miliband calls any scepticism ""a retreat into a world of realpolitik"". Such point scoring may do for an Oxford debate but not for bereaved army mothers taking him to the high court, or the thousands of victims of his doctrine who see hard power interventionism as a menace to life and order. The professor of political science at Baghdad University said yesterday that the imprisonments under Saddam were more tolerable than the weekly murders, kidnappings, militia censorship and female repression his department is suffering. Is Miliband saying, from the comfort of his office, that this man is deluded? Few would quarrel with the platitude that democracy is the least worst way of governing a freedom-loving state. But history shows that democracy takes centuries to bed down in any culture (including Europe's). This generation of western politicians has no experience of war and little sense of history. The new interventionism may differ from the old imperialism in not seeking to settle or rule countries. But it is the same in believing that western values can (and should) be imposed on often reluctant states through military occupation. I regard the way I am governed as superior to most. But I am not so arrogant or naive as to believe I can change other states by persuasion or war. The latter is an infringement of self-determination and has proved starkly counterproductive. The greatest boost to the overrated Islamist threat is from just the power projection Miliband supports. In the non-interventionist 1990s, the thinktank Freedom House charted a steady growth in democracy worldwide. With the advent of the democracy crusaders Blair and George Bush this trend has probably gone into reverse. The cynical appeasement of China and aggressive treatment of Russia and the Muslim world has done no service to democracy. Indeed the cause has fared better in south-east Asia and Latin America, where outside pressure has been least in evidence. There is no text in international law that justifies ramming a system of government down the throats of others. Self-determination, warts and all, has been the defining essence of the nation-state throughout history, which is why the UN charter qualified it only in cases of cross-border aggression and humanitarian relief. The robustness of this doctrine is shown in half a century of relative peace worldwide. Collapsing it has been disastrous. Democracy everywhere has emerged when individuals give or withhold consent and rulers are confident enough to accept their verdict. Besides western Europe in 1945 (when democracy was not created but restored), there is almost no example of democracy imposed by external force. Russia, with no experience of it, appears to be rejecting it. The concept of consent in countries such as Egypt, Pakistan and Iran is hesitant, but western pressure, soft or hard, aids the reactionaries. There is one simple way of honouring Britain's pride in its chosen system: prove it works at home better than any other. That means working tirelessly to refresh it. This is not easy, as Miliband should know in his failed bid to regenerate civic democracy. It may seem small beer, but how can he preach reform to others when he cannot achieve the tiniest reform himself? The west can invite the world to witness the virtues of democracy. It can deploy the soft power of education, exchange, publicity and aid. But a true democrat cannot abandon Voltaire's respect for the autonomy of disagreement, let alone seek to crush it. Britain can shine its beacon abroad but it cannot impose its values on the world. It has tried too often, and has failed. This is not isolationism. It is fact. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com",Simon Jenkins: This zeal for intervention is imperialism in new clothes,2008-02-13T00:11:30Z,Simon Jenkins,politics
"It's an unlikely image, I know: Gordon Brown in his socks, a bottle of beer in hand, watching Leon and Rhydian square off on The X Factor. It could be a Rory Bremner sketch, the great leader as Jim Royle, putting the world to rights from his favourite Downing Street armchair.  Brown says it's his kids who got him into what is fast becoming a national tradition for Saturday teatime, watching wannabes take a shot at fame on any one of several TV shows. When the children are hooked, ""you tend to watch"", Brown says. Given their ages, four and not yet two, this sounds a tad suspicious. More likely is the version that says the TV was on after the football and the PM caught it once and then again and again. Whatever the explanation, he's hooked.  This being Gordon Brown, though, he didn't just veg out and dumbly soak up the weekly rounds of Any Dream Will Do. Those BBC searches for a new Joseph or Maria got him thinking, convincing him that what has long been a cherished political theme is, in fact, in tune with the spirit of the age.  The theme, one that predates Pop Idol, is that the core objective of progressive politics should be the unlocking of previously untapped talent. Labour's mission should be to enable everyone, no matter their background, to realise their potential. He reckons this is a cause for which the British people have an instinctive sympathy; the success of TV shows committed to discovering buried talent, even in those who come from nowhere, proves it.  There will be some mockery of this, no doubt. It doesn't help that Labour's record on social mobility is woeful. And there's a genuine question as to whether, after 11 years in power and Brown's dreadful autumn, anyone will listen to the government at all. Nevertheless there are good reasons for him to pursue it.  First, this is ground on which he is immediately comfortable. Partly that's because it fits with his biography: Brown has spoken of his anger at the way some of his school contemporaries were cast aside simply because they failed to make the cut early in life. Some of the best passages in Brown's speeches rail against the discarding of countless millions whose misfortune was not to be born into the right family or the right class. In 2005 he urged the Labour conference to ""reflect for a moment on the talent wasted, the loss of what might have been, the great music never composed, the great art never created, the great science never invented, the great books never written"".  In his article for the Observer last Sunday, Brown quoted the 18th-century poet Thomas Gray, whose Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard gazes at the tombstones of those whose lives were thwarted, wondering if deep in the ground lies buried a ""mute inglorious Milton"". This is powerful material for a Labour leader, and Brown has the advantage of actually believing it. But he goes further, adding to this traditional, moral argument a modern, economic one. Brown warns that unskilled labour is about to become extinct in this country: only half a million such jobs will be needed in the Britain of 2020. Unskilled work, he assumes, will be done by China and others who can do it for a fraction of the cost. Therefore if Britons are to earn a living it will have to be in skilled jobs. In other words, realising the British workforce's potential is not just a matter of being nice to those who are hard done by - it is a matter of economic survival.  This is prime New Labour terrain, the place where social justice - the moral imperative to release people's talent - meets economic efficiency, the need to stay afloat in a fierce, globalised world. Brown will try to cast it in more positive terms than that, suggesting that globalisation offers an opportunity, to Britain at any rate. In the past, there was only a limited amount of room at the top: there could only be so many doctors or lawyers or film-makers. Now that we're in a global economy, the top is much bigger: there's no reason why the entire British population - just 1% of the world's people - could not be in the top tier. As a theme, potential offers Brown another advantage: it is not abstract. He will make it concrete by using it to explain his approach to education, which is increasingly central to Brown's programme (no wonder he gave the job to his most trusted ally, Ed Balls). Plans to raise the school leaving age to 18, to double the number of apprenticeships and to introduce diplomas, awarding as much status to non-academic learning as is currently attached to A-levels - all those plans will be bound together by the connective tissue of ""unlocking potential"". These changes to education will be sold as awakening talents that would otherwise lie dormant.  As such, Brown hopes he will draw a sharp dividing line with the Conservatives. So far, and to his great pleasure, the Tories have played along, opposing the changes to education, even calling the increase to 18 a ""stunt"". That delights Brown, who privately notes that the Tories, in earlier eras, opposed the increase in the school-leaving age from 14 to 15, and from 15 to 16. To his mind, it's the same vested interest at work that in the 19th century allowed children to work up chimneys. What's more, he can use this theme to make the larger case for government itself. As he told Policy Network last week, this is work that charities or individuals cannot do alone: ""It often takes government to bridge the gap between what people are and what they have it in themselves to be."" These, then, are the advantages of what Downing Street will not be calling the X Factor strategy. But there are risks too. Brown lays himself open to at least two attacks from the left. First, if releasing potential is the goal, what has the Labour government been doing for the last 11 years? If anybody has had their potential released in recent times, it's been the 2 million foreigners who have joined the workforce, their numbers increasing by 75% in six years, while stubborn pools of British unemployment remain. These critics would say globalisation has certainly proved an opportunity for those eastern European newcomers, and for companies hiring them on the cheap - but it hasn't unlocked the talent of many Britons.  Second, if the government is committed to removing the barriers in people's way then surely the most screamingly obvious are poverty and inequality. It's these, above all, that hold people back. And yet here Labour's record is depressing: the gap between rich and poor has widened, thanks to the runaway rich, and today's under-40s are less socially mobile than their parents.  Brown answers by citing Labour's action on child poverty and by insisting that the long-term solution is precisely the care and education for under-fives that, he believes, will give even the poorest child a decent shot at life. Privately he goes further, conceding that there are ""old hierarchies"" that hold people back and ""hidden injuries"" that scar those who have for generations lived with diminished aspirations.  But he is reluctant to wade publicly into these choppy waters: he has unhappy memories of the Laura Spence affair, when he took up the case of a talented state-school girl denied a place at Oxford. It's a pity because this is precisely the stuff that could give his theme of ""unlocking potential"" political bite. After all, for any contest to be really interesting there has to be a genuine clash.

"Like many a hack, every so often I get a missive from a bright young thing asking for advice on how to become, well, me.  All very flattering until the questions start - best journalism course to take; college to attend; career path to weave. At which point, the whole thing becomes disconcerting on several different levels: first, these clever, ambitious charmers are clearly after my job (Anne Baxter in All About Eve, via email).  Second, and most crucially, I have no gems of wisdom to impart about journalism courses, internships and the rest, because I never got to do any of that. Indeed, my overriding thought as I hamfistedly attempt to reply ('Avoid everything I did') is a slightly sad one. How would the person I used to be (young, up for it, but also penniless, clueless, without a middle-class safety net) get on in 2008? In these changing times, what are the breaks for people like me? The answer is, one suspects, not many. This brutal truth was highlighted by new Housing Minister Caroline Flint's call for 'commitment contracts' from council tenants, under which the 'long-term unemployed' would have to promise to work or risk losing their homes.  Presumably, Flint's vision of 'long-term unemployed' does not include disabled people, single parents, the genuinely depressed and just plain stuck; just that convenient cartoon image of a work-shy layabout, with tattoos and lager breath, watching daytime TV with his faithful rottweiler by his feet. As anybody who has ever done 'long-term unemployed', as I have, can tell you, the truth is often sadder, sometimes happier, but definitely more complex than that. I grew up in a council house in Rutland and my parents and all our neighbours worked, probably because there was work - not degrading McJobs or training schemes more suited to 16-year-olds. This is not to brag about our superior survival skills. Our family chose a good place to be working class. In leafy Rutland, we struggled; transplanted to the inner cities, we'd doubtless have drowned like kittens thrown into a ravine.  The point is that bumbling around in my late teens/early twenties, living in various squats, housing association homes and council flats, being poor continued to be do-able. Like all the other directionless idiots I knew, I signed on, claimed housing benefit and ate baked beans straight from the tin. The idea was somehow to keep afloat while one followed one's 'muse', which in my case was churning out music fanzines nobody wanted to read until I could get to college and get a degree I'd forget to collect. Could this happen today? One doubts it. Considering I spent four years signing on, qualifying as a 'long-term unemployed', one assumes my rent would have been stopped, my benefits frozen, someone like Flint coming to the conclusion that my 'commitment contract' was void. She would have been wrong. For people like me, those years as welfare sloths counted among the most priceless and productive years of our lives. Those tiny cheques serving as a kind of grant, while, to paraphrase the Pet Shop Boys, you became 'the creature you meant to be', welfare culture dovetailing with the counter-culture in a wonderful display of optimism and energy.  Indeed, if you weren't from a cookie-cutter, middle-class background, this was one of the ways you did it, how you made your great escape. Leastways, it used to be. It seems inconceivable that broke young people could get away with it now. Any young people, in fact.  It says something that once again we're hearing about the boomerangs - those middle-class children who bounce back to parental home straight after university, often staying well into their 30s. When I first heard about them a couple of years ago, they made me howl with laughter - it was just the thought of all these 'Jeremys' and 'Jemimas' trying to conduct adult sexual relationships in their teenage bedrooms underneath their horse posters, all that heavy breathing among the Garfield pyjama cases.  Now the whole thing makes me sad. For if middle-class children, those with the golden ticket of education and privilege can't hack it, if they have returned home, limping and wounded, unable to cope with student debts, job cuts and general hopelessness, then what hope is there for the poorer struggling kids, the ones who, like me, all those years ago, were relying on being able to somehow 'wriggle through'?  With people such as Flint coming up with 'big ideas' like 'commitment contracts', the journey just gets harder and nastier, to the point where, although I was a welfare sloth, I'd take that any day over being a boomerang or, indeed, any young person these days. So there's the answer for all those bright young things who want to pick my brain on how I 'made it'. The truth is, sweeties, I probably wouldn't these days. Men get to express themselves and women still have to take the Pill One couldn't but notice that the new public health campaign to bring down rates of unwanted pregnancy, especially among teenagers, is still about the girl. The emphasis rests on implants, injections and other forms of long-term female contraception, seemingly because women (dozy mares) can't be trusted to take the pill properly. Meanwhile, chaps get a gentle push towards condom vending machines. Granted, it is women who get pregnant. Then again, who gets us pregnant? Moreover, in the big rush to control female sexuality and fertility, it seems to be forgotten that, especially when young, it is males who are the tarts - sorry, I mean the most keen to express their innermost selves in that 'special' way. Young men want sex; young girls want attention (with some sex thrown in). All this seems to echo the constant quasi-misogyny underscoring issues of female fertility, namely, women shouldn't be left to their own devices because they'll muck it up. The whole sorry mess is symbolised by a (male) God looking down and yelling: 'It's either babies too early or babies too late with you chicks - you're driving everyone crazy.' Never mind that there are usually perfectly good explanations, for instance, 'too posh to push', which long served as proof that women couldn't even be trusted to give birth properly. Last week, it was discovered that, far from being feckless, or wanting to get back into their Juicy Couture, these women are just plain terrified of giving birth. Quite understandable. Any man who wishes to disagree is free to do so, though he must complete my patented inter-gender empathy experiment - squeezing a couple of red-hot kidney stones the size of walnuts through his urethra should do it. And the 'male Pill'? Every so often, we hear it's imminent and columnist-hags like myself dutifully churn out our 'Can we trust them?' line and then ... silence. Another day, another missed opportunity for men to put in a little more effort than occasionally shambling over to the Durex machine. Indeed, odd really that females continue to get all the flak, when pregnancy, unwanted or otherwise, would appear to be the ultimate 'sharing' experience. Oi, you Aussies - hands off the only real men left here There's a new drive to lure skilled British workers into emigrating to South Australia. The somewhat cheeky campaign features anti-Brit sentiments such as 'Sod London Prices', 'Screw working in Staines' and 'Bugger it, I'm off to Adelaide.' Isn't this is a bit like when the boy with the scabbed knees and the haunted eyes can't stop pulling your pigtails in the playground? As in, the Australians love us really. In fact, they're obsessed, but they fear rejection (all that historical unpleasantness with the convict ships) and so the hurt and the hatred (OK, the good-natured mutual teasing) rages on. I would go myself on a Kath & Kim-loving ticket, but they don't want me - I'm too old and I'm not 'skilled'. And there lies the rub. I'm sure I speak for all British women when I say I don't want the Australians to take our 'skilled' men. As in, the men who can actually do something - sort out plumbing, build bridges, mend cars and so on.  What would we be left with? Prince William boogying at Boujis? Gavin Henson in Boots musing over which wax is best to remove his chest hair? Basically, it would be the girlie dregs - those British guys I've been reading about who are taking ever longer and longer to groom themselves before going out.  In some areas (that's you, the South), men are fussing with their appearances only 13 minutes less than women. This is not to judge - no one wants to go back to the dark days when a purposeful squirt of Right Guard down the front of the jeans was the summit of the male British toilette. Just to say, can't righteously macho Australia keep its hands off our 'skilled' and take the New-Groomed instead? Nose-trimmers, sheep clippers, it's all the same really. They could both learn so much from each other. Are we really ready for the rockocracy? Lovely to see Madonna and her 11-year-old daughter Lourdes at a star-studded United Nations event that raised an estimated £2.5m for Unicef. Just one quibble - wasn't there a Lady Bracknellesque air of grandeur to Madonna's presentation of Lourdes, almost as if the little Ciccone were a debutante 'coming out'? If so, and rock and pop royalty are intending to ape high society, it may be time to set some ground rules, the most important being that we, the public, get to choose. One can accept Lourdes as a rock and pop debutante - she is exquisite and her mother deserves some kind of payback for all those brave attempts at the English accent or, indeed, any other kind of talking. Mick Jagger's model daughter Lizzie is another shoo-in. Regrettably, with Sting's brood, we're not so sure. As for Michael Jackson's kids, seen recently looking disturbingly normal, we can't have any old riffraff getting in. Next week: does Gwyneth's penchant for eating naked ruin daughter Apple's chances? Glastonbury goes hip hop 20 years on Interesting that Michael Eavis is so eager to trumpet the fact he's got Jay-Z - the first hip hop artist to headline Glastonbury.  Eavis is rock's Tony Benn - he's been around for a while, he's basically decent and no one likes to slag him off, even though 'Glasters' is only bearable if you're under 21 and don't mind ingesting four tons of mud along with your 'mood enhancers'.  Still, with Glastonbury approaching 40, one would have thought Eavis would play down the fact that it's taken this long to get a black hip hop act headlining.  Another artist lined up is Leonard Cohen, who, one hears, will take the stage after 'shunning' live performances for more than 10 years. And there was I thinking we were shunning him.","Barbara Ellen: At least when I was skint, Caroline Flint wasn't around to shatter my dreams",2008-02-10T12:30:35Z,Barbara Ellen,politics
"Funny, isn't it, how we have come this far in the US election campaign, reaching the milestone of results from 24 states in the early hours of this morning, and still a mystery remains - one that has vexed more than a few Guardian readers. Despite all the ink spilled, the pages filled and the airwaves crammed with coverage, they complain, there is something large they still don't know. What, exactly, do these warring candidates stand for? Partly this is a media mea culpa, to go alongside the, er, misreading of the New Hampshire primary. For what have been the dominant themes so far? Barack Obama's rhetoric in Iowa, Hillary Clinton's tears in New Hampshire, the role - asset or liability? - of Bill, the cost or benefit of Obama's race and of Clinton's gender. On the Republican side, we've had Mitt Romney's Mormonism, John McCain's age and Mike Huckabee's wit. That's a bit of a caricature, but not so far off. Policy differences have not exactly been centre stage. And yet, it would be a grave mistake to conclude that somehow this election is nothing more than a personality contest, albeit a gripping one. We could repeat the old cliche - that, under the surface, all these politicians are the same - but too many made that mistake before. In 2000 it was fashionable to say that Al Gore and George W Bush were ideological twins, the Tweedledum and Tweedledee of bland centrism. Now we know, to our cost, how wrong that was. So perhaps today, as the presidential campaign enters a new phase, we should take a hard look at what these candidates are about. Start with Obama, the candidate who, more than any other, is accused of being light on detail. It's true that he offers nothing like the programmatic minutiae of Clinton, but it's still clear where he stands. During the last month, Obama's standard stump speech opened with a declaration that ""The nation is at war and the planet is in peril"". In that single sentence, he signalled two radical breaks with the last eight years, on Iraq and on climate change. On Iraq, he cites his own early opposition to the war to draw one of his sharpest dividing lines with Clinton. Back in October 2002, when he was a mere member of the Illinois state senate, he addressed an anti-war rally. At that same moment, Hillary Clinton voted in the US Senate to authorise the use of force in Iraq, a decision she has never renounced. Obama doesn't quote his own speech but it would be powerful if he did. He condemned ""a dumb war, a rash war"" in terms that look remarkably prescient now. More than five years on, Obama promises a US withdrawal and ""no permanent bases"" in Iraq, besides a garrison to protect the US embassy in Baghdad. He would send more troops to Afghanistan. He would then open talks with Iraq's neighbours, including Iran and Syria, because strong countries ""talk to their enemies as well as their friends"". He would not only end the war in Iraq, he says, but end the ""mindset that led to the war in Iraq"". That means an effort to restore America's standing in the world. Accordingly, he would close Guantánamo and restore habeas corpus rights so that no suspect could be detained without charge. He speaks about the assault on civil liberties entailed by what he does not call the ""war on terror"". Related will be his effort to wean the US off Middle Eastern oil, required anyway to make the move towards ""green energy"". (Both he and Clinton avoid the language of climate change and global warming, as if preferring to focus on the solution rather than naming the problem.) He suggests setting a new fuel efficiency standard of 40mpg for motor cars. Domestically, he wants to pay teachers more, to offer help with college bills to young people who do voluntary work and to do the same for returning military veterans. He speaks about financial excesses, citing ""the CEOs who earn more in 10 minutes than ordinary people earn all year"". He wants to raise the cap on social security contributions which at present sees Bill Gates pay as much as a worker who brings in $97,000 a year. ""Millionaires should pay their fair share,"" he says. Clinton touches some of the very same points, even in the same language, though she has wavered on the social security payment question. She, too, is for help with student grants, and keen to forgive the debts of those who become teachers, nurses or police officers. She, too, wants greener energy, favouring micro-generating solutions that would feed electricity back into the grid or that would see solar panels on household roofs. She also wants to ""end the war in Iraq and bring our troops home"", promising to start withdrawing personnel within 60 days of taking office. Her husband says ""we're going to use diplomacy with friend and foe alike"", a slight shift from her earlier condemnation of Obama as ""naive and irresponsible"" for suggesting he would talk to the likes of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Fidel Castro. Her signature difference with Obama is in the provision of universal healthcare. Both agree it's a calamity that tens of millions of Americans have no cover. She would impose mandates, obliging everyone to be insured; he proposes no such compulsion, assuming that people will buy insurance once it becomes affordable. Crudely, then, she is to the left of him on healthcare and he is to the left of her on Iraq. Otherwise there is huge overlap between their programmes - and, what's more, both would be recognisable to European eyes as pitched firmly on the centre-left. That has not always been the case with America's Democratic party. (Much credit for that goes to former candidate John Edwards, whose message of economic populism dragged both Obama and Clinton leftwards and obliged them to replace platitudes with gritty policies.) Given this closeness between them on so much of the substance, it's hardly surprising their contest has turned into a duel over their personal merits as candidates. But that should not obscure a larger truth, also made clear this primary season - that the gulf between them and the Republicans remains wide and real. On the large themes that unite Obama and Clinton, the leading Republicans are squarely opposed. During the last month, they have competed to declare their support for the Iraq war: Baptist preacher Huckabee said that just because no Iraqi weapons of mass destruction had been found it doesn't mean they weren't there: ""Just because you didn't find every Easter egg didn't mean that it wasn't planted."" Romney promised to double the size of Guantánamo. On climate change, McCain concedes the problem, but would have little support in his party for taking any action: his arch-rival Romney would only say that man ""probably"" plays a role in global warming. As for the rest, the social programmes favoured by the Democrats are condemned as wasteful spending, and the need for universal health coverage barely registers. The battle so far may seem to have been about identity politics, résumés and political style. But don't be misled: the ultimate battle will be about two entirely different conceptions of the US and its place in the world. freedland@theguardian.com",Jonathan Freedland: There are real differences between the US candidates,2008-02-06T15:16:21Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"What should we do about the kids? Families are mini-civilisations; experience and research show they are the best means of rearing our young into fulfilled adulthood. But families are the prisons that can deform individuals for life and whose private arrangements generate fantastic inequality for society beyond. Parenting offers endless dilemmas - navigating your way between throwing a protective mantle around your children, and knowing that it is only by withdrawing the mantle that they can achieve the independence necessary to you and them. There are also pernicious social consequences from your family choices. Should you care? In conservative times, we hear much about the benefits of family, too little about the degree family can be bad both for children and for our wider society. One of the consequences of Tory MP Derek Conway losing his job for giving his sons our money for doing nothing is that a spotlight has been shone on the dubious practice of MPs employing family members and the culture that justifies it. In conservative lore, nothing should prevent - certainly no obligation to society - parents being able to give everything to the children they love, the tearjerker argument that shadow Chancellor George Osborne used to justify his proposed lifting of the threshold for inheritance tax to a £1m. Conway, the bone-headed Tory, was merely stretching that philosophy to the limits, but has found that there are obligations, such as accountability and propriety, that get in the way. It was public money he had been spending. The case was open and shut. But parallel arguments extend to the private sphere, as Nigella Lawson showed in a widely publicised interview in My Weekly. She differed from her husband, Charles Saatchi, she said, about how much of their estimated £110m fortune they should leave their children. Echoing American billionaires Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, she believed that too much inherited money corrupts children; they need to work. Her husband took the premodern, dynastic and conservative view that every penny should be passed on with the DNA. On her website, Ms Lawson subsequently revealed that this shouldn't be understood as a desire to leave her children destitute. It is about choosing between leaving nothing and everything, a debate about degree that extends well beyond the Lawson/Saatchi family. In an era of sky-high house prices, how much of the equity in your home should you give to your children to buy theirs? How much inheritance should you leave them? How much should you be the 'helicopter parent' hovering obsessively over your offspring and fighting for the best across the board? Plainly, you can and must enable your children: to prohibit them from accessing what you have and who you are is impossible and would be counter to our deepest instincts. But at what point does such enablement become destructive for them and for society? A generation ago, there would have been very many more who took Nigella Lawson's view that the bias must be to help children stand on their own two feet. Now the doctrine is that the family must rule. Today's parents have become obsessive about their children, relentlessly buying them every advantage they can which they cap with the promise of the maximum inheritance. It is not just the growth of tutoring and private schools; it extends to university. Dr Paul Redmond, Liverpool University's head of careers and employability, tells how a growing number of parents challenge exam results, attend career fairs and even negotiate their children's first salaries. It is parents who are behind the new market in downloadable, prewritten essays. Parents use every tool possible to advance their child's cause and universities are developing a response. Huddersfield University is the first to have a parents' liaison officer; many universities now have 'parent packs'. As Redmond says, this hyperactivity beyond a certain age actively harms children. Employers want rounded, self-starting adults, not overgrown children used to their parents constantly bailing them out when called upon. The mobile phone is an often disastrous kind of umbilical cord. Too much parental involvement infantilises children, whether driving them a few hundred yards to school when they are teenagers or joining them for interviews with potential employers when they are young adults. Expectations of future inheritance tends to remove a key spur to self-improvement and self-control. Fewer and fewer of the very rich consider bequesting their assets to charity, a university or a great cause; the volume of giving has remained static over the last decade despite the upsurge in private wealth. They would rather spend it on themselves and leave the rest to their children. A recent London School of Economics report shows that Britain has the highest number of family firms managed by children of the founder; it is a managerial disaster, a potent explanation of our poor productivity. Few think to challenge the practice or endorse the call for higher inheritance tax to check it. Part of the explanation is the privatisation of the public sphere. The more the realm of the private grows, the less accountability and fairness can be expected. That old injunction that it's not what you know, it's who you know seems truer than ever. The only network you can rely on is family. This is reinforced by a mawkish conservatism that celebrates blood, tribe and nation; we are not a society trying to advance together but a network of concentric blood rings radiating out from family, in which case we had better look out for our own. Jean-Paul Sartre wrote that the existential freedom to make and remake one's life could only be achieved by rounded adults and that adulthood required rupturing the bonds with one's parents to reconstruct them later. Parents setting out to cosset their kids surely have a greater obligation: to help them become adults in the best sense of that term. The paradox is that you make that rite of passage harder by gilding it too much with family advantage. Our private and public choices should reflect that truth.",Comment: Why too much care for your child can harm society,2008-02-03T15:16:14Z,Will Hutton,society
"So tell me, how is Nicolas Sarkozy's reform programme coming on; what progress to report? ""Love, this is serious love. You must understand. She is a very beautiful woman. And Sarko, he has the aphrodisiac of power. They talk five, six times a day. It is a complete coup de foudre."" Sorry, I asked about your president's promised changes in French domestic policy. ""You see, he was terribly bruised when Cecilia left him. He was quite dependent on her, boasting during the election, 'You liked Jackie Kennedy; you'll love Cecilia.' Then off she goes with her lover and accuses him of being a womaniser, cheap and not even loving his own children."" Yes, yes, I understand, but what about the future of the 35-hour week? ""Carla is a 40-year-old woman in a hurry. She wants another baby and apparently even had sperm stored from a previous lover, for artificial insemination. After a while, a girl wants to settle down. All right, let's try the Société Générale scandal. What is likely to happen to ... ""You see, Cecilia insulted his manhood. He is hyperactive and not much liked, but this was not about a person, it was about love. He is badly wounded and along comes this gorgeous thing and, pouff, she offers love and revenge in one. He even buys her the same ring as he bought Cecilia, from the same shop, with the same cut. C'est magnifique, et c'est aussi la guerre."" Fine, perhaps we could turn to ... ""Don't get me wrong. She's no fool. Her Italian stepfather is a 12-tonal composer and her mother a concert pianist. Yes, she chased Mick Jagger, Eric Clapton and Donald Trump. But she lived with a real philosopher, Jean-Paul Enthoven, and then went off with his son, Raphael, who is also a philosopher. I gather she got rather bored with Nietzsche. Her songs are good. She won the French grammy in 2004. He may seem a catch for her, but she is a catch for him. Phew, this is big."" Such conversations, at present ubiquitous in France, depict a modern democracy at the mercy of an infatuated ruler. The mind ponders Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, Edward II and Gaveston, Antony and Cleopatra. What impact does love have on power? Will there be Reformations, faces launching a thousand ships, ""a Roman by a Roman valiantly vanquished""? Bruni is plainly a woman of substance. Italian born but French raised, she is a self-confessed flirt and seductress, free with her lifestyle maxims. ""I was a huge product before,"" she said of her singing career, ""I am a heart product now, and the product is my soul."" Of her last lover, she sang that he ""looks like an angel, but he's a devil at love"". Their affair precipitated a spectacularly poisonous novel from Raphael's wife, including a threat to kill her. ""Everyone has a weak point,"" said Bruni, ""you have to have the guts to show it,"" and presumably see it in others. When working as a model, she claimed to read Dostoevsky behind her copy of Vogue. Perhaps she learned from Raskolnikov that ""man grows used to everything, the scoundrel!"". Perhaps she forgot Karamazov, that ""beauty for the mass of mankind is found in Sodom ... It is a terrible and an awful thing."" Bruni may be enamoured of the architect of the edifice of France, but does she want, like Alyosha, ""to found that edifice on its unavenged tears""? There is already a wild recklessness to Sarkozy's rule. He came to power last summer like a boy suddenly finding himself king of the castle. He decided to launch a ""Marshall plan"" for the suburbs, to ban advertisements on state television, to found 10 universities, to reform the 35-hour week, to protect French banks from sovereign wealth funds, to build a military base in the Emirates and to tax mobile phones. He commissioned the economist Amartya Sen to rewrite French statistics so as to embrace the country's much-vaunted ""quality of life"". He invited the philosopher Edgar Morin to set out his vision of a renaissance in France's new ""politics of civilisation"". Sarkozy's eagerness to give France a new world confidence, after the grim introversion of the Mitterrand and Chirac years, is attractive. He has visited 20 countries in his first year, including America, Russia, China, India and some in the Middle East. He summoned the socialist economist Jacques Attali and asked from him ""300 decisions for changing France"" and even promised: ""What you propose, we shall do."" Attali sardonically repeated this quote in the introduction to his report, delivered last month, recalling that the similar Pebereau and Camdessus reports had both been shelved. Among his 300 decisions were to teach economics in primary schools and deregulate taxis, pharmacies and hypermarket prices, each one likely to wipe 10 points off Sarkozy's poll ratings. The shelving has already begun, not least on the 35 hour week. Like his friend Tony Blair, Sarkozy regards pledges as not promises but vague declarations of intent, mood music played out against the tapestry of power. French commentators and gossips understandably ask whether their new president will behave in power as he does in love - given his infatuation with both. Can a man so inconstant in his pledges to the French electorate be constant in his love for Bruni? Can a woman so brazenly inconstant to her lovers be constant to the president of the republic? And what nuclear explosion might occur if the answer to any of these questions is no? Hanging dark on the walls of the Cluny museum in Paris is the celebrated 15th-century tapestry sequence of the Lady and the Unicorn. After depicting the five senses of touch, taste, smell, hearing and sight, the sequence culminates in the enigmatic last work, A Mon Seul Désir. Here the lady appears to renounce all other senses in front of a tent whose flaps are held seductively open by a lion and a unicorn. The possible meaning of this scene has held historians and philosophers in thrall for centuries. What is this sixth sense? Is it the burning heart, the devout soul, a sexual liaison or the liberation of the Renaissance woman? I favour an answer offered in the commentary from Saint-Exupéry's The Little Prince. The tamed fox, the prince's tutor in love, declares: ""Now here is my secret, a very simple secret: it is only with the heart that one can see rightly; for what is essential is invisible to the eye."" France just now appears led by invisible desires. Will its president be reduced to gazing on his Cleopatra and crying, ""Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch of the ranged empire fall! Here is my space!"" Shall Elysée be drowned in a thousand kisses? Or did the fox speak true? Will the opacity of the heart's desire lend a boldness, an inner wisdom, to Sarkozy's rule? Either way, a new chapter in French history is being written, and, who knows, perhaps a new chapter in the art of government. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com","Simon Jenkins: Infatuated with Sarkozy's infatuation, France is blind to his recklessness",2008-02-01T15:16:24Z,Simon Jenkins,world
"This should be the Democrats' year. That's what the conventional wisdom holds anyway, citing a Republican presidency that sputters towards its end saddled with some of the lowest poll ratings on record. President Bush's State of the Union address on Monday was a non-event; even his fellow Republicans barely mention his name. One survey last week showed seven out of 10 Americans believe their country is on the wrong track, a political landscape that has to favour the challenger party. Meanwhile, the Democrats are energised, their turnout in primaries doubling as they pack out public meetings with, at one rally this week, young voters queuing around the block to get in. Surely 2008 will belong to them. And yet politics is rarely that straightforward. When pollsters ask voters to say whether they will favour a Republican or Democrat for president, the Democrat has a handsome lead. Trouble is, there will be no generic Democrat on the ballot in November. There will be an actual person, either Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama, against an actual Republican. And that changes everything. As one pollster puts it, this race will ""be about the candidates, not the climate"". Judged by that standard, it is Republicans, not Democrats, who now seem to be making the right moves. Of course, in this of all years, we know things can change. But, as of today, John McCain is the frontrunner for the Republican nomination, thanks to a clear, hanging chad-free victory in Florida. He did that despite having much less money than his immediate rival, Mitt Romney - who saturated the Florida airwaves with 10 TV ads to every one of McCain's - in a large, complex and diverse state where the one-voter-at-a-time, retail politics of tiny New Hampshire did not apply. Obstacles remain for McCain, starting with the fact that ultra-conservatives can't stand him. Having spent more hours than is healthy driving through South Carolina and Florida this last week, listening to talk radio throughout, I was struck by the fury McCain arouses: the special contempt for an ideological traitor. King of the genre Rush Limbaugh warns that a McCain nomination is ""going to destroy the Republican party"", that rightwingers will stay at home in November rather than vote for him. I watched Romney tell a dawn rally in West Palm Beach that McCain's would be a ""liberal Democrat"" administration - no greater insult for the American right - citing McCain's soft line on illegal immigration and his bill to combat climate change. Romney warned Floridians that the latter would put $1,000 on their energy bills to combat a problem that should be solved by the rest of the world. ""They don't call it American warming,"" Romney said to cheers, ""they call it global warming."" If these are the grievances the Republican hardcore has with McCain, perhaps the rest of the party realises these are also the issues that might let him win the general election, when a Republican has to win over everyone else. Given the climate, it might be smart to propose for the White House a Republican who is not too Republican. The right may lambast McCain for failing to vote for Bush's tax cuts or for seeking restrictions on guns, but that makes the senator appealing in the eyes of moderates. Liberals could not hope for a better advocate against Guantánamo and the use of torture than this former war hero and PoW. It's true that he is a serious hawk on foreign policy, an unwavering advocate for the war on Iraq, but he is no Dick Cheney - a hate figure who would scare Democrats into doing anything to stop him. As for his position on climate change, which seems sincerely held, I encountered a green activist in Florida who once voted for Al Gore and who has now come over to McCain. From now until Super Tuesday, the Limbaugh/Romney assault that insists McCain is not a true conservative could hurt - though McCain need only hit back by pointing out his opponent's inconsistency, especially on social issues such as abortion. ""He has made a consistent point of taking both sides of every issue,"" a smiling McCain told me when I caught up with him in Orlando. (One reason why the senator enjoys such a good press is that he takes, and answers, reporters' questions.) But if McCain does indeed wrap things up next week, the rightwing critique becomes a positive asset. It also leaves the Democrats in an uncomfortable position, especially if February 5 delivers no such clear verdict. First, the Republicans will have a head start in closing ranks and marshalling resources, while Clinton and Obama will still be taking lumps out of each other. Second, McCain can get on with the business of making a national case for himself as president, while Clinton and Obama will still be obliged to tailor their message for a Democratic-only electorate. That will give McCain a chance to define himself before his eventual opponent can do it for him. The Democrats took a first step in the direction of resolution yesterday, as John Edwards closed out what had been a brave campaign: how exhilarating it was to hear a mainstream centre-left candidate use the phrase ""extraordinary economic inequality"" in his stump speech. It would be good if Obama and Clinton were to adopt more of that message as they compete for Edwards's voters. What would be even better is if Democrats were to show some of the sense exhibited by their Republican counterparts, and choose a candidate who appeals beyond the party and can win over the unconverted. That surely has to be Barack Obama. freedland@theguardian.com",Jonathan Freedland: McCain's gain proves the need for cross-party appeal,2008-01-31T15:16:24Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
"Nothing and nobody can stop bombs going off. No citizen, no police force, no army, no government and no global military alliance can prevent a determined suicide bomber from blowing himself up. It will happen and innocent people will die as a result, horribly, as they do on the roads, from drugs and alcohol, or from natural disasters - again without responsible authority being able to stop it. What is recent is the admission of this truism into the mainstream of government under the rubric of ""terrorism"". This week two outgoing presidents, America's George Bush and Pakistan's Pervez Musharraf, defined their terms of office in relation to terror. Bush did so in his final state of the union message on Monday and Musharraf that same day in London during a charm offensive prior to next month's elections. To Bush, the ""war on terror"" is the ruling mantra of his politics of fear. Since 9/11 gave a prop to his weakening presidency, his language has scaled new heights of alarmist rhetoric. It has validated every internal repression and every external war. ""He who is not with us is against us,"" he cries. Terrorists everywhere are ""opposing the advance of liberty ... evil men who despise freedom, despise America and aim to subject millions to their violent rule"". As the sociologist Ulrich Beck has written, ""properly exploited, a novel risk is always an elixir to an ailing leader"". By declaring a threat so awful as to be intolerable, a politician can limit the liberties of a free society in the name of risk-aversion. Musharraf utters hardly a sentence that does not contain the word terror. Pivotally close to the base from which 9/11 was apparently launched, his dictatorship has been indulged by London and Washington for a full seven years. This week Gordon Brown hailed him as a ""key ally on terrorism"", enabling him to take comfort in sacking his judiciary and curbing his media. Had the war on terror been used only as a metaphor for better policing, like rhetorical ""wars"" on drugs, poverty and street crime, it might have passed muster. Bush and Musharraf have found the military metaphor too potent to resist and duly carried it into literal effect. The result has been a disaster for their countries, and incidentally for themselves. The west's Afghan adventure is now devoid of coherent strategy. Soldiers are dying, the opium trade is booming and aid lies undistributed. Command and control of the war against the Taliban is slipping from the most bizarre western occupying force since the fourth Crusade to a tight cabal around the Afghan ruler, Hamid Karzai, who is fighting to retain a remnant of authority in his own capital. Karzai's exasperation with the west has led him to refuse the services as ""coordinator"" of the former Liberal Democrat leader, Paddy Ashdown. The latter may have cut a dash in the subsidy swamp of Sarajevo, but in Afghanistan he would have been a boy on a man's errand. Karzai knows well that his fate lies not with the patronising platitudes of western proconsuls but in the hard graft of provincial warlords, drug gangsters and Taliban go-betweens. These go-betweens have had their status massively boosted by the war on terror. Bush's demand in 2001 that Musharraf ""join the war"" sent Pakistani forces into the border territories, breaking old treaties and driving the Pashtun tribes into the eager arms of Taliban leaders. This undoubtedly saved Osama bin Laden's skin from the fury of the northern Tajiks, committed to avenge his murder of their leader, Ahmed Shah Massoud. Musharraf, at America's bidding and with $10bn of American money, has done what even his craziest predecessors avoided, and recklessly set the Pashtun on the warpath - increasingly in thrall to a revived al-Qaida. The result is a plague of suicide bombings and killings in the heartland of his benighted state. From the law courts of America to the mosques of west London and the mountains of the Hindu Kush, the war on terror has been lethally and predictably counter-productive. It embodies the new stupidity in international affairs. Nobody disputes that there are killer cells at large in the world, most of them proclaiming various Islamist creeds. It is the job of intelligence agencies and the police to catch as many as they can. After a hesitant start, they appear to be quite good at it. Some bombs will get through but they will not be deterred by draconian laws, any more than by machine gun-toting policemen in Downing Street and Heathrow. Robust societies can handle this admittedly intermittent threat. Only weak ones will capitulate to it. The menace of these killers lies not in their firepower but in their capacity to distort the judgment and commitment to freedom of politicians too cowardly to bear on their shoulders the burden of risk. In two weeks' time, the fragile democracy of Pakistan will defy the bombers and hold an election prior, it is hoped, to some version of democratic rule. Such communities will defy a probable burst of terror bombs only if their leaders stop setting ""terrorists"" on a pedestal and using language that exaggerates their capacity, as Bush puts it, ""to oppose the advance of freedom"". It is leaders, not bombers, who have the power to balk the advance of freedom. Already those leaders have used the war on terror to introduce the Patriot Act, Guantánamo Bay and a $1.5 trillion war in Iraq. In Pakistan they have used it as an excuse for emergency rule, the imprisonment of senior judges, and the provocation of unprecedented insurgency in the north-west frontier territories. In Britain leaders have used the war as an excuse for 42-day detention without trial, the world's most intrusive surveillance state, and not one but two contested military occupations of foreign soil. This so-called war on terror has filled the pockets of those profiting from it. It has killed thousands, immiserated millions and infringed the liberty of hundreds of millions. The only rough justice it has delivered is to ruin the careers of those who propagated it. Tony Blair was driven to early resignation. Bush has been humiliated and Musharraf's wretched rule brought close to an overdue end. It may be an ill wind that blows no good, but it is hardly enough. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com",Simon Jenkins: The 'war on terror' licenses a new stupidity in geopolitics,2008-01-30T15:16:41Z,Simon Jenkins,world
"Few experiences are so exhilarating as seeing art before completion. The Russian show at London's Royal Academy is a composite work of art. I sneaked in to see it last week, to wander on my own through its echoing rooms, as technicians adjusted a light here and a nameplate there. The pictures were like actors at final rehearsal, testing their voices, adjusting their makeup, looking askance at each other. The effect was surreal. As the spotlights dimmed and brightened, Matisse's dancers seemed ready to swirl from their frame and escape down Piccadilly to a nightclub. The Royal Academy's latest blockbuster is enjoyable not just for the celebrity of its works - built round 50 French impressionist and postimpressionist masterpieces - but because it tells a story. It sends us away informed as well as inspired. Given the poor quality of some of the Russian works, it may send many engrossed in dispute. Why was France alone so creative in the 1900s? Russia at the time was America's equal in industrial muscle, and probably superior in taste. The country was immensely rich. That wealth yielded collectors no less astute than their American counterparts, trawling west Europe for paintings, as Catherine the Great had done a century before. In particular, they turned their attention to France. Today we admire the impressionist treasures in America's great museums but understandably forget the trove that has slept undisturbed mostly in the vaults of St Petersburg's Hermitage and Moscow's Pushkin Museum. At the turn of the century, the two most prominent collectors were the textile tycoons Sergei Shchukin and Ivan Morozov. Their purchasing was near manic. Shchukin bought more than a hundred early Picassos and personally commissioned Matisse's La Danse, a more vivid version of that in New York's Museum of Modern Art. These men filled their Moscow mansions with Manet, Bonnard, Monet, Renoir, Cézanne, Van Gogh and Gauguin, and invited artists to see them. The exhibition strides confidently through this narrative. It opens with pensive 19th-century Russian landscapes and portraits, including Ilya Repin's celebrated picture of Tolstoy barefoot in peasant garb. Over them - indeed over the whole exhibition - hovers a cloud of tense dramatic irony, the viewer's awareness that all this would soon end. From here we are led directly into the explosion that impressionist France brought to the salons of Moscow. Here are Monet's Poppy Field, Manet's bar scene, Cézanne's Woman in Blue and Renoir's exquisite garden group. We pass into the main gallery, dominated by Matisse's apotheosis of the dance, painted in response to Picasso's poised Demoiselles d'Avignon. Five naked revellers, bursting from all times and none, hurl themselves about the canvas in the 20th century's homage to primeval energy. Opposite hangs Bonnard's vision of the dance, but here the participants cavort decorously in a bucolic Grasse landscape. The two works, painted at the same time, are at different ends of every spectrum, yet are embraced by the same creative enterprise. Their distraught conversation is flanked by Picasso's Dryad, Gauguin's Sweet Reveries and Braque's gloriously shaded landscape of the Castle at La Roche-Guyon. The exhibition is worth a visit for this room alone. Sated with such riches we next hear the sound of Russian music (except there is sadly no music) in the form of a room devoted to Diaghilev. His Ballets Russes and Stravinsky's Rite of Spring were one Russian response to the impact of postimpressionist France. Bakst depicts the suave impresario with his old nanny, sad but emphatically present in the background. Russian art now takes over, as painters stumble to meet the French challenge. They begin with their roots in iconography, symbolism and the patriotic realism championed by Tolstoy, Mussorgsky and Borodin. As France makes its impact, the consequences can be grotesque. Petrov-Vodkin's two boys dancing naked against a green and blue background is a horrible spoof of Matisse. Painters of whom few will have heard seem derivative, mimicking expressionism, cubism, fauvism, even surrealism. Yet gradually they emerge into the light with a voice of their own. The names and works become familiar once more. We see Chagall's despairing Red Jew and his surreal love picture, Promenade. We see Kandinsky's Winter and Malevich's bold abstracts. At last the message seems to have taken hold. There is hope. Suddenly it stops. Two brief decades of cultural penetration come to an end and darkness gathers. After the revolution most of these pictures disappeared from view, and by 1948 Stalin pulled down the shutters on the Pushkin Museum, to which Shchukin and Morozov had bequeathed their collections. It was, he said, ""a breeding ground of formalist views and obsequiousness before decadent bourgeois culture"". My one regret is the absence from the show of the art of which Stalin approved, by way of contrast and warning. It ends on a dying fall in the emotional emptiness of dictatorship. There is only Tatlin's 1919 model of a gigantic spiral tower that, it was hoped, would be revolutionary Russia's answer to the Eiffel Tower. It was never built. The works on display come from four museums, the Hermitage and the Russian in St Petersburg, and Moscow's Pushkin and Tretyakov. They offer merely a taste of the treasures buried in their vaults, which few people alive will ever see. About 90% of the Hermitage's collection is not on view, including works that any other museum, city or nation would give a fortune to exhibit. Yet, at the same time, these museums are chronically short of funds for showing or conserving what they have, let alone for acquiring or commissioning new work. They are the most extreme case of asset rich and cash poor. Sooner or later the professional museum fatwa that treats these places as private curatorial archives and denies their governors freedom to trade collections must crumble. The crude chauvinism that says that a work of art must be ""saved for the nation"", even if then buried by the nation, is the most arrogant of imperial leftovers. Art should be displayed. Russia has more works of global appeal than it can possibly handle, yet desperately needs money to look after a fraction of what it has. When Russia was rich, it garnered the choicest works of France and Italy, as Britain did before it and America afterwards. Today new lands and new publics should be able to purchase and enjoy at least what Russia (and others) cannot possibly display. International conventions can be drawn up to prevent abuse, like those of Britain's Museums Association and others debated in last September's issue of the art magazine Apollo. For example, pictures should be sold only to replenish collections, not to repair roofs, though even that is surely worth doing in extremis. The world does not come to an end if a Monet or a Matisse hangs on a wall in Los Angeles or Dubai rather than being stored in a basement in Moscow or London. The world is enhanced thereby. Russia will always have treasures and to spare to stage a display like this. What it cannot display it should sell to those who can. Pictures are painted to glorify the light of day, not the gloom of vaults. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com",Simon Jenkins: Forget saving it for the nation - great art must be freed from the vaults,2008-01-25T15:16:32Z,Simon Jenkins,world
"There you are then: Peter Hain hobbles to the backbenches, James Purnell takes his place at the Department of Work and Pensions, and the understated-cum-drab tenor of the Brown government is sustained. Not that the Tories' ministerial team has much in the way of charisma or flash, but these days you do hear the odd senior Labour voice worrying about how distant the days of the Mo Mowlam/Clare Short cabinet now feel, and the fact that the government seems almost wholly represented by stereotypical members of the Political Class. In that sense, Purnell is a figure straight out of Central Casting, with a CV that takes in work as a researcher for Tony Blair and a spell at the IPPR, and with 117 Facebook friends who include Krishnan Guru-Murthy, the New Statesman political editor and one-man anti-Livingstone blitzkrieg Martin Bright, the Channel 4 political correspondent Cathy Newman, Telegraph political journalist Jonathan Isaby, and Benjamin Wegg-Prosser, the one-time adviser to Peter Mandelson. A ker-ay-zee guy, evidently. In fairness to him - and nothwithstanding plenty of unease about his stance on broadcasting funding and recent policy at the Arts Council - he seemed to me to have found an enviable niche as culture secretary. His claims to cultural literacy were way more convincing than his predecessor's (that was Tessa Jowell, in case you'd forgotten). He went nowhere near any rhetoric you'd think passionate, but his belief in the wonder of the modern metropolitan arts scene was obviously sincere. Plenty of people in what we these days have to term the Arts Community welcomed his appointment, and it wasn't hard to see why. And now? This, needless to say, is a promotion. From time to time, Purnell has been tipped for even greater things - possibly, even, as a future Labour leader. But leaving aside the fact that his heartfelt Blairism would make some us shiver at that prospect, any talk about his supposedly glowing prospects also points up what he, and most of his Westminster contemporaries, singularly lack: any kind of political backstory. The age of the young Labour firebrand is long gone; MPs no longer toil in the real world before pushing their way on to a selection list. As a consequence, as was once said of David Frost, supposed high-flyers ""rise without trace"". When this Labour generation comes to slug it out in any contests for high office, how will people choose between them? Ed Balls or David Miliband? Liam Byrne or James Purnell? Who knows ... or cares? The imbroglio over donations to his deputy leadership campaign underlined Peter Hain buffoonish aspect, and his apparent quest to step into the soft-left vacancy left by the late Robin Cook was always fatally compromised by his record on Iraq. But consider this: a politican with exactly the kind of fascinating history that is becoming a political rarity has gone on his way, to be replaced by a capable-but-grey New Labour technocrat.

"Which of us did not feel the world had changed beyond measure having read that an Ofsted study has found schoolchildren deem geography ""irrelevant"" and ""boring""? What on earth has happened to geography's insane cool of yore, when a patched-corduroy-jacketed buccaneer would wonder why the word KCID flashed up when he switched on the overhead projector, and turn an exhaustedly blind eye to moderate cider consumption on field trips? Gone, it seems, along with the ability to identify the capital of Facebook on a map. Understandably, the matter is of much concern to the powers that be, and they promise ""radical reforms"" to put geography back where it belongs. Their first step will be to examine how other countries are meeting the challenge, perhaps beginning with a look at the US, where the government appears to be rolling out a hardhitting interactive campaign to raise the profile of geography. In 2003, the country's National Geographic Society conducted a study in which 18- to 24-year-olds were asked to place various countries on a world map. For whatever reasons - not including the US's ongoing romance with xenophobia - a mere 13% could point to Iraq, and 17% to Afghanistan. Did the US government have some angsty huddle with school inspectors who agreed that ""geography was at a crucial period in its development""? No. That's the cheap option. Instead, they sent many thousands of their citizens from this precise age range on an all-expenses-paid field trip to both these countries. I'll bet those youngsters can point at Iraq and Afghanistan now. Well, the ones with arms can. And you know what? They did all this untrammelled by heath and safety regulations. So it's possible, if we put our minds to it. It was the American writer Ambrose Bierce who once remarked that ""War is God's way of teaching Americans geography"", and though the Almighty's educative methods can seem a little extreme - is there a Montessori version of them, I wonder? - he definitely hit on the global need to bring a little vim to this potentially dour subject. If this week's Ofsted study has shown us anything, it's that we need a new geography for a new geopolitics, with this column only happy to provide a work book for the teacher no longer willing be pigeonholed as ""the scree guy"". There is still a place for field trips in this brave new world, but with the aforementioned pressure of health and safety, you should attempt to combine as many strands of geography as possible in one expedition. Afghanistan is an ideally efficient choice, weaving physical, political and human geography together in spellbinding fashion. Assemble your group pretty much anywhere in this intriguing war park, then explain that this rock formation is called rubble. And what was it before that? Anyone? OK, it was slightly larger rubble left by the Soviets. Before that it might have been an early hospital, but your coursework will only go back to the early 1980s, so you needn't worry about that. The classroom will, of course, be the hub of your activities, and it is here that you should remind students that maps have always been just a point of view. With the shift from hunter-gathering to agriculture, cartographers no longer focused on hunting trails and prey movement but on field systems and property relations. And so today, where the ""level playing field"" appearance of the classic world map looks bizarrely antiquated. Encourage the children to divide the world into ""places you might like to visit again"" and ""places suitable for hosting wars"". Explain that we do things this way because it's better to take the fight to the terrorists before they bring it to us. Explain this hurriedly - they may spot flaws. Later in the course, get pupils to draw maps of the world with the scale of countries determined not by physical size but their sense of self-importance. Isn't Britain huge? Use this as the reference map for your classroom wall. History remains a valuable example of what not to do - and not just because it's ""the other humanity"". In the 1980s, Saddam Hussein commissioned a globe with all the Arab countries in the world shaded orange and the rest of the world yellow. Look how he ended up. Today's sensitive child should be encouraged by the ancient South Asians, whose preoccupation with cosmology was such that earthly maps were rarely made.

After complaints, the real pictures were restored, but isn't it nicer to draw a veil over the unsightly? Was cartography the first airbrushing?

"Only one man can rescue the embattled Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, from his growing domestic unpopularity. That man is George Bush. Ahmadinejad faces elections in March and an increasingly disaffected clergy, but he feeds on Bush's antagonism. This week Bush has duly obliged. He has raced round the Middle East drumming up support for his Iranian foe. Bush has denounced Ahmadinejad at every turn. He has offered to sanction him, embargo him, isolate him, even bomb him. He has portrayed him as a monster of evil and ""leading sponsor of terror"". He has showered the Saudis and the Gulf states with $20bn of weapons to confront him ""before it is too late"". When Ahmadinejad thanked ""divine intervention"" for making him president in 2005, he should also have thanked God for having first selected Bush. To have Washington as your enemy in these parts is to have every man your friend. The dwindling raggle-taggle army of neocons is currently trying to portray US strategy in the region as a success after all. This is entirely based on news from Iraq, where General David Petraeus has reduced the death rate of Americans and Iraqis from the astronomical to the merely appalling. Since this conflict is far too dangerous to report properly, world opinion is reliant on a notional monthly kill rate to measure progress. Petraeus, or at least the exhausted citizens of Iraq, have thus offered the White House a respite from horror. The tactics are exactly those that Petraeus's predecessors rejected in the past four years of mayhem. He has encouraged and armed local militias, good and bad, to defend their communities. In Anbar province, this has meant backing Sunni sheikhs and former Ba'athist gangsters, styled ""the awakening"", to face down the al-Qaida mafia. This was suggested by British MI6 agents in 2003 and rejected by the Pentagon. In Baghdad, the tactic has meant building fortified and ethnically cleansed ghettos, mostly in Sunni areas, and arming them against the former campaign of slaughter by the Shia militia/police, many of whom work for the interior ministry. Within the ambit of American protection, this has meant a modified return to normality. Petraeus has proved a wise commander. His men do not go kicking their way into women's bedrooms, shooting family parties and shelling villages, which was Donald Rumsfeld's way of winning hearts and minds. There is also a limit to how long any citizenry can remain in a state of medieval siege. Markets will struggle to operate. Schools will try to reopen. Elsewhere, old habits die hard. Last week the biggest bombing raid since the invasion was unleashed on a populated area in Diyala, north-east of Baghdad, causing as yet unrecorded devastation. On Monday one of Iraq's most distinguished judges was left unprotected and was assassinated. Water and power supplies to the capital are said to be worse than ever. No effort has been made to stave off the conflict likely to envelop oil-rich Kirkuk, let alone a simmering war on the Kurdish-Turkish border. In other words, it remained unthinkable that Bush's lap of honour round the region last week might include the city he supposedly ""liberated"". Sooner or later the Americans must withdraw from the enclaves they have de facto partitioned. A new, homegrown, home-fought balance of power will be found in Iraq. Petraeus's strategy is certainly the best yet tried by the coalition, but it offers no long-term surety of law and order because it is backed by no political settlement. It is worth noting that Basra, from whose civil chaos British troops withdrew in despair last year, has dropped from the radar. It is strange what happens when alien forces withdraw from occupied lands. Stripped of its post-9/11 retribution, bombast and militarism, American policy towards the Muslim world has been to promote democracy as the one sure means to prosperity and peace. Condoleezza Rice and others declared in 2005 that ""the bad old days of favouring stability over democracy are over"". Even friends such as the Egyptians and the Saudis were mildly rebuked for turning a deaf ear to this message. As policy, this was noble. If America (and Britain) were ill-advised to call it a crusade, there are certainly worse causes to promote. Yet Bush and Tony Blair were unaware of how their inevitably ""neo-imperial"" wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, coupled with American support for Israel's expansionism, would render their crusade hopelessly hypocritical. Muslim democracy is a moot concept, but it has made a sort of imprint on Iran, Palestine, Lebanon and even Iraq and Pakistan. Yet it was not these leaders that Bush graced with a visit this past week. He went to Kuwait, Abu Dhabi, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain, where he was feted with gifts of gold, rubies, emeralds and diamonds. It sure beat a walkabout in downtown Baghdad. In Pakistan, Bush continues to back dictatorship and must suffer the resulting Taliban ""blowback"" in Afghanistan. In Palestine he ignores the winner of an election, Hamas. He appeases Hosni Mubarak's dictatorship in Egypt and is craven to the autocrats of Saudi Arabia. His spokesman, Steve Hadley, challenged on what such rulers contribute to democracy, could only bumble that ""these folks are on board with the freedom agenda, and are pursuing it in their own fashion"". Stability trumped democracy after all. Insofar as any strategy lay behind the Bush trip, it was a hope that the monarchs of the Gulf might support the US in military action against Bush's pet hate, Ahmadinejad. Yet if there is one lesson these rulers know, it is to live at peace with the wilder regimes to their north and east. Indeed, keeping them wild suits them fine. Dubai is built on the funk money of the region. The last thing the Gulf intends to do is help the US to yet another war, least of all with Iran. Meanwhile, Bush cannot even see the final irony. The one thing that might unseat Ahmadinejad is a poor showing against the moderates in the half-free parliamentary elections in March. If his party does badly, there is a chance of a more reasonable regime taking over, reasonable on anything from Iraq to nuclear weapons. At least it is worth waiting. Yet Bush does everything to generate the paranoia on which Ahmadinejad bases his electoral appeal. He threatens him with the constraint of war, and thus dilutes the constraint of democracy. Does Bush not realise how attack from outside helps an embattled leader? Has he forgotten 9/11? simon.jenkins@theguardian.com","Simon Jenkins: Bush's trip, without principle or plan, had one big winner",2008-01-16T15:15:20Z,Simon Jenkins,world
"Soon after Nicolas Sarkozy's election, Alain Finkielkraut, a prominent philosopher in France and a former supporter of its President, implored him, on television, to stop jogging. Although photographs of Sarkozy lolloping up the Elysée steps in a sweat-soaked T-shirt lent some force to Finkielkraut's objections - that the habit is individualistic, right wing and, above all, undignified - one felt, at the time, that French intellectuals should consider themselves lucky. Jogging seemed a relatively wholesome habit: we had just discovered that Sarkozy's friend and mentor Tony Blair liked to pose in his underpants, with Alastair Campbell supplying an audience: 'How many Prime Ministers,' Blair liked to ask his foul-mouthed mirror on the wall, 'have a body like this?' How Finkielkraut, and the rest of France with him, must pine today for a time, only seven months ago, when the most embarrassing thing about Sarkozy was his knees. The height of his shamelessness, back then, was to invite the brainy playwright Yasmina Reza to accompany him for 100 days of his presidential campaign, so as to provide the nation with an 'existential portrait' of his soul. Her study emerged last August with the opening line: 'L'homme seul est un rêve.' Prophetic words, you might think, though there is no further evidence, in Reza's often opaque text, that Sarkozy is the sort of man who, like many Presidents before him, is never without a girlfriend. Even in the best-run European capitals, an immediate replacement may not always be available and an entire month separated divorce from Cécilia Sarkozy (19.10.2007) and the dinner party at which he encountered Carla Bruni (23.11.2007) and ceased, as he seems helpless to stop telling us, to be un homme seul Reza's L'aube le soir ou la nuit is not that kind of book: it chronicles the pre-Bruni months, when Sarkozy's political ambitions appeared to conform more closely to the traditional French model than Blair's celebrity version; when his vanity, too, found its expression in a respectable literary exhibit, rather than in photographs modelled on Patek Philippe advertisements, in which the President, wearing, say, a pristine black polo/jacket combo, poses with his girl and his heritage timepiece before a backdrop of handcrafted pyramids. As beguiled as she clearly she was by the would-be-President's energy, his restlessness and sporadically fragile 'petit garçon' look, Reza noted his interest in watch advertisements ('lovely Rolex') and eye for quality tailoring. Here he is in Toulouse, meeting a fellow politician, Philippe Douste-Blazy: Sarkozy: 'Il est élégant, ton costume.' Douste-Blazy: 'Prada.' Sarkozy: 'Beau tissu, belle coupe.' Such was the lustre of President Sarkozy's early reputation that it glimmered through the publication of this odd little book, packed though it is with evidence of its subject's shallowness, his endless unimpressive remarks and silly verbal strutting: 'Si je n'existais pas il faudrait m'inventer'; 'L'amour, c'est la seule chose qui compte.' As this once-artful manipulator intended, Reza introduced the republic to selected glimpses of his human side: he swears, he loves sweeties, he can't stand Bretons, he experiences something close to melancholy on the fulfilment of his life's ambition - without causing any damage to his personal dignity or to the office of President. That particular feat Sarkozy has subsequently accomplished in far less than 100 days, entirely by himself. Admittedly, this programme of self-destruction required the co-operation of 'Carla', as he alludes to his new fiancée in press conferences. A more cautious single parent than Bruni might have balked at organising the first family photo-opportunity within four weeks of meeting; or objected, at least, that it is pretty much a convention among middle-aged couples to enjoy a minimum six months of intimacy before attempting something as extreme as a visit to Disneyland and only then after thoroughly exploring issues around consent. Fortuitously, however, Sarkozy seems to have found a free spirit equal to his own, a woman whose commitment to ungovernable passion eclipses Chantelle and Preston's, Cerys and Mark's, Anthony and Cleopatra's - an impressive feat when you consider that the latter did not have a six-year-old son (last seen hiding his face behind his hands at the couple's Petra photo-opportunity). But clearly, Miss Bruni, the singer, has less to lose, when it all goes wrong, than either her son or President Sarkozy. Whatever possessed this quondam champion of privacy, this hammer of the work-shy, to report on his own romance while at the same time supplying limitless photographic evidence of sunny lushery to France-bound champions of the 35-hour week will, one day, have to be diagnosed by an expert - hopefully someone less like the demi-dazzled Miss Reza and more like the wise Alain Finkielkraut, whose prescience on the subject of jogging politicians is predicted to restore to French philosophy a degree of reverence it has not enjoyed since the age of Voltaire. But the French ideal of privacy, a willed, often imperfect form of repression that begins to look more and more appealing in the light of Britney's persecution, emerges from Sarkozy's soap opera so damaged as to be, perhaps, unsalvageable. If it is not his fault that Cécilia, in her slapper-induced fury (Carla, she hints, is not the first of her rivals), is now proving so much less manageable than the women who serially obliged Mitterrand and his colleagues, it is certainly his own folly, in repeatedly invading his own privacy, that now leaves him bereft of any protective dignity; a mess he chooses to represent as his latest bit of trademark rupturing, this time of 'a deplorable tradition in our country, that of hypocrisy and lies'. Supposing the President is, indeed, rational and not in the throes of some disabling hormonal delirium, this rejection of the French legal tradition whereby private life is 'murée', or walled off, in favour of openness for its own sake is certainly consistent with other American borrowings, from bellicosity towards Iran to his NYPD T-shirt. Whether the romantic confessions are, indeed, made on principle or, as seems more likely, out of compulsive exhibitionism, Sarko's current efforts should certainly protect the French public from any future Mitterrand-style cover-ups, at the same time that they promise to destroy any chance of his successors enjoying a private private life. As for the British: we have surely seen the last article about high-profile sexual intrigue, featuring the insight that the French arrange these things so much better. For that, as well as the peerless entertainment, and for eclipsing painful memories of Blair's own sunkissed man boobs, we owe Sarkozy a debt of gratitude. There is even cause for celebration: who, recalling the unrelieved bleakness of Gordon Brown's relaunch, does not now exult in having a leader of such sublime sobriety, whose briefest allusion to his father's precepts can infect an entire nation with seasonal affective disorder? Though we must not be complacent. Not in the context of recent reports, alleging that Brown has taken up jogging.","Catherine Bennett: Once there was discretion at the Elysée, now there is farce",2008-01-13T15:15:14Z,Catherine Bennett,world
"At long last, Tony Blair has unveiled his fabled legacy. And - would you believe - it will be an actual legacy, in the most mundane sense of the word. All those years of people wondering what on earth he'd scratch about for to pass on to future generations, and it turns out the answer was ""a lot of money"". Then again, the most obvious place is always the last one you look, isn't it? Quite why there has been the remotest surprise as to how Mr Blair has begun his second act is a mystery. On Thursday he announced he would be taking an estimated £500,000-a-year advisory post with the investment bank JP Morgan, and the only conceivable shock will be if he has had the confidence to get his market rate. Under his leadership, you'll recall, New Labour turned tricks for rich donors for the most paltry of sums. They took a mere £100,000 from Richard Desmond, just days after - by a dazzling coincidence - they had waved through his £125m purchase of Express Newspapers. And, as Desmond later told this newspaper: ""I gave a cheque for £100,000 and they spent £113,000 or £114,000 on advertising. So I made money on the deal."" Perhaps because he hung around so many rich people, Mr Blair certainly appeared to suffer from an inferiority complex regarding his own worth or that of things in his gift, a trait which armchair psychologists also noted in his special, give-and-take relationship with the US president. He gave, Bush took. Just memories now, as he adds the JP Morgan job to his role as the Quartet's Middle East envoy, and to his stewardship of something called the Tony Blair Sports Foundation, which should delight those who simply haven't seen enough pictures of him having a kickabout in brogues and a Newcastle strip. (Indeed, with a vacancy having opened up at the football club to which he is so unconvincingly devoted, and the fans apparently hellbent on parachuting in someone with no experience at all, he should at least make the short list to replace sacked manager Sam Allardyce.) Amusingly, in these new roles he has managed to distil the essence of Blairism more perfectly than he ever did in office. We might paraphrase his ideology as a birra cash, a birra Middle East posturing, a birra football, and a lorra lorra grins. That makes it sound far more complex than it is, but you get the idea. Speculation abounds over the ""further positions"" he has yet to announce, though you'd think the former PM might need to address the star-humping aspect of his skill set, perhaps by launching his own chatshow as his predecessor Harold Wilson so horrifyingly did. (On further consideration, that wouldn't suit him at all, unless he was the only guest every week.) But, as mentioned, none of this is surprising, and he must do something with his time. Given that these days people become party leader at about 12, their career trajectory can be seen as most analogous to that of a professional footballer, with early retirement necessitating the carving out of a new direction that, though not offering the adulation you once received, will at least keep you in Range Rover Sports or Renaissance palazzos. For erstwhile footballer Jamie Redknapp, this new direction involves dressing up platitudinous nonsense as a serious point on Sky Sports; for erstwhile leader Blair, it will involve doing much the same only on some podium in Jerusalem, or at the JP Morgan Christmas lunch. The only thing we must be disapproving of is the vogue for likening the Blairs to the resurgent Clintons. No, their story arcs diverged a long time ago, and it is quite another famous couple upon whom our former PM and his wife appear to be modelling their second act. Well, isn't it obvious? The trolley dash mentality, the ever-expanding portfolio, the whole his-n-hersness, American dreaminess of it all: what are the Blairs if not the Beckhams with law degrees? How unnervingly like David and Victoria are Tony and Cherie, with the chaps' more natural charisma underpinned by the lesser-loved ladies' flinty protectionist instincts. Look at the emphasis on their very coupledom, their pashes on America, that clear belief that the USA is the land of opportunity where they will be celebrated, as opposed to sniffed at for being vulgar. Just like the Beckhams, the Blairs have the separate autobiographies, the sports foundation, the overplayed ambassadorial roles ... even the fashion gaffes. At this rate one half-expects the planned launch of fragrances on the Beckham model - Intimately Blair for him, and Intimately Blair for her. Pending satisfactory sales, they will be followed by Intimately Blair Nightz. The Beckhams are the ultimate private citizens with lucratively attention-seeking public lives, yet deliciously untrammelled by standards commissioners and the like. What very modern models for a second act they are, and we must long for the day on which their lives and the Blairs' finally collapse into one another, as both couples are photographed enjoying a free holiday together on the JP Morgan corporate yacht, an image so surpassingly heartwarming it will bring immediate peace to the Middle East and the wider world. marina.hyde@theguardian.com","Marina Hyde: The Blairs are back on stage, in a Posh'n'Becks tribute act",2008-01-12T15:15:46Z,Marina Hyde,politics
"National causes can be made of small things - one thinks of Jenkins' Ear - but few can have had such a charming and witty source as the collection of small objects known as the Lewis Chessmen that have since the mid-19th century delighted visitors to the British Museum. The chessmen inspired the stories of Noggin the Nog; Harry and Ron Weasley played a game with replicas in the first Potter film. People take a great shine to them: the queens with their hands to their cheek looking so wise (or so bored), the wardens or rooks furiously biting their shields (the ""berserkers"", the soldiers of Odin). Now they have been registered as a political grievance. Scotland's first minister wants them back. On December 19, Alex Salmond made a speech outlining the Scottish government's proposals to preserve the Gaelic language, and containing the following two sentences: ""I find it utterly unacceptable that the Lewis Chessmen are scattered around Britain in a bizarre parody of the Barnett formula. And you can be assured that I will continue campaigning for a united set of Lewis Chessmen in an independent Scotland."" This isn't quite the same thing as Captain Robert Jenkins showing off his pickled ear to the House of Commons in 1738, prompting a war against Spain that lasted nine years. Nevertheless, the war of the Lewis Chessmen threatens to run and run. The comparison with the Barnett formula, which sets the level of Scottish subvention from the UK Treasury, is unclear, but the pieces are not ""scattered around"". The British Museum holds 67 chessmen and the National Museum of Scotland 11. They were made from walrus ivory in the 12th century, most probably in Norway. Chess had reached Norse civilisation not long before, after its slow journey from India to southern Europe via Persia and Arabia. Europe had humanised the abstract form of the Oriental pieces, even feminised one of them by turning the vizier into a queen, and military Christianity had replaced princes or ""leapers"" with bishops with mitres and croziers. To quote the excellent monograph written by a British Museum curator, James Robinson, the chessmen are ""unique survivals ... no other visual record survives that documents so perfectly the full range and variety of arms and armour used in 12th-century combat"". The likeliest speculation is that these beautifully crafted luxuries were on their way to princes or traders in the Norse-held territories of Ireland or the Isle of Man when, for reasons unknown, they were buried in the sand dunes of western Lewis. The story of their discovery is also not reliably known. Most accounts give a crofter, Malcolm Macleod of Uig, as the man who brought them to a Stornoway merchant, Roderick Pirie, who took them to Edinburgh, where they were first displayed by the Scottish Antiquaries Society in 1831. The society wanted to buy them and preserve them as a collection, but the deal fell through. By this time an Edinburgh dealer, TA Forrest, had acquired them for £30. Forrest began negotiations with the British Museum. There were 82 pieces, and the museum was led to believe this was the extent of the hoard. But Forrest had already sold 10 pieces to an Edinburgh antiquarian, who then bought another stray bishop (these pieces now form the National Museum of Scotland's collection). Neil MacGregor, the British Museum's director, knows of the demand only from reports in the press. Nobody from the Scottish government has been in touch. This month he emailed Linda Fabiani, Scotland's culture minister, to ask if the first minister's statement was an expression of his government's cultural policy. ""Because if it is,"" says MacGregor, ""we need to understand the principles that lie behind it."" So far he has had no reply. (One can see Fabiani's difficulty. Shetland has been pressing strongly for the St Ninian's Treasure, a hoard of Pictish and Anglo-Saxon silverware, to be returned from the National Museum in Edinburgh. Last year Fabiani refused to support the Shetland claim, saying, ""We have a hands-off approach to our cultural bodies, national collections and national companies, which is how it should be."") Restitution of objects to where others think they belong is an increasing problem for many of the world's greatest museums, but the British Museum acquired its pieces legally and fairly and they are seen by many thousands of people from all over the word every year, for free. What could the arguments behind the chessmen claim be? That they can't be seen in Scotland? But they can. The British Museum lent many pieces to Stornoway's museum in 1995 and 2000, and is now in conversations about further loans. That they somehow embody ""the spirit of the place""? A problematic argument, given their origins in Norway. That art and treasure best belong where they were found? As MacGregor says, ""That would be a very alarming principle for Scotland's own public collections. Let's not forget that Scotland was part of a great imperial power and therefore has great imperial collections."" A stroll around Scotland's largest museums would demonstrate his point. Is the Wylam Dilly, one of the two oldest locomotives in the world, to be returned to Newcastle from Edinburgh? Is Boulton and Watt's giant beam engine, built for a Southwark brewery in 1786, to go to Birmingham? Should all the beautiful grave-robbings go home to Egypt? If the rule were applied to Glasgow's Burrell collection, there would be nothing left, the ship-owner William Burrell having hopped around auctions like a magpie, picking up a Chinese pot here and a Norman arch there, including many items (it has to be said) from England. As for paintings, it is best not to go there. The place is heaving with Impressionists. The Bretons, some of them striving to be a nation, would have an excellent claim on Gauguin's Jacob Wrestling with the Angel, now resting at the National Gallery of Scotland instead of reminding Brittany so superbly of its patrimony and traditions. (And please don't mention the Elgin marbles, purchased by a Scotsman enriched by the profits of his Fife coalfield.) It would be easy to accuse Salmond of nothing more than opportunism, adding to his reputation for that streak. In fact, he has been sporadically campaigning for the return of the Lewis Chessmen for 10 years. My explanation is that his demand comes out of a previous era of nationalism that was quite blind to Scotland's history as England's imperial partner - needed to be blind to it, because in terms of wealth it was Scotland's golden age and inconvenient to anti-English grievance. I had thought that the grievance mode was passing. But not yet, not yet. The idea has got about that England stole the chessmen and hid them in vault: ""Give us back our wee men!","Ian Jack: Our chessmen were taken, but Scotland is heaving with stolen art",2008-01-12T15:15:46Z,Ian Jack,uk
"Poor Lahore. Yesterday this jewelled city of the Raj was hit by a suicide bomber aimed at lawyers protesting at President Pervez Musharraf's imprisonment of his top judiciary. As body parts scattered the tree-lined Mall, Kipling's ""city of dreadful night"" became the city of dreadful day. Nor could the outrage have happened in a more symbolic spot. Just up the road from the bombed Victorian high court stands ""Kim's gun"", the great 18th-century Zam-Zammah cannon, pointing towards the scene. While the historic cities of Pakistan's great rival, India, soar up the league table of celebrity, nothing better displays Pakistan's current misery than the state of Lahore, joint capital of many an Indian empire and of British Punjab. Splendid Victorian palaces still line the boulevards of the Mall: the high court, the governor's house, the general post office, the government college and Lahore's museum, Kim's ""Wonder House"". Even the art college built by Kipling's father, John Lockwood Kipling, survives, with students squatting under giant fans in its corbelled hall. The style of these and other buildings is the ""Anglo-Saracenic"" (or Mughal-Gothic) with which the engineer/architects of the Raj paid their respects to a local culture over which they intended to rule for ever. Bursting with imperial confidence, the buildings are the glory of Punjab and the most remarkable group of 19th-century public buildings anywhere, complementing Lutyens's Edwardian Rajpath at the eastern end of the Grand Trunk Road in what today is India. A mile away across this now sprawling 8 million-strong metropolis heaves and sweats Lahore's walled city, old and unchanged. Here, on a wet January night, one can easily imagine the fleet young Kim darting through the mud and huddles of humanity, over the rooftops on some mystery ""woman's errand"". At its heart lies Lahore fort, its gates, gardens, mosques and decorative finishes the finest Mughal monument after the Taj Mahal. Crowded outside its walls are scruffy courtyard houses (havelis), markets, food stalls, brothels and alleys of unimaginable dirt and decrepitude. Buried within are shrines, mosques and derelict palaces. Only a few structures have been restored by enthusiasts, such as the exotic Cuckoo's Den restaurant by the fort. In no other world city have I seen so much magnificence so neglected. Pakistan's ancient sites, those of the Indus civilisation and Taxila and Moenjodaro, are well guarded. Limited preservation is being done on Lahore fort and Shah Jahan's exquisite Shalimar Garden in the suburbs. But saving Lahore itself has become a desperate struggle conducted by a few lone warriors, such as the Karachi architect Yasmin Lari, and Lahore's Kamil Mumtaz. Yesterday's blast at the high court followed persistent attempts by the government to demolish the building, despite its handsome moulded brick walls and terracotta, marble and teak inside. The authorities also tried to demolish old Tollington market on the Mall. Looking like an East Anglian railway station, it was saved by public outcry and is now a thriving art centre. Such carelessness is not for want of help. The World Bank offered $10m to restore the old city, which the authorities used to pay for drains. A so-called Sustainable Development Walled City project has hired offices and bureaucrats, but seems to have lost the will to conserve anything. Nobody is trying to stop a hotel company from buying up a street of havelis and demolishing them - houses that in Marrakech would be worth millions and might one day be so in Lahore. There is no protection for these structures, and if there were a well-placed bribe would negate it. Even a modest project initiated by Lari to restore the royal route through the walled city from the Delhi Gate to the fort has ground to a halt, from a mix of corruption and inertia. The gate itself was demolished by the British in the 19th century but rebuilt, probably at Curzon's instigation, in the 20th. Through the murk of the royal route can be seen Mughal arches, lattice-work panels and classical porticos. All Pakistan's history is here, but disintegrating beneath encroaching shanties, cobwebs of wires and piles of rubbish. Meanwhile the dictatorship is spending $1bn on a new army headquarters in Islamabad. Islamabad, five hours north of Lahore, offers a glaring contrast. This is Pakistan's own Chandigarh, Canberra or Brasilia, a new city built from scratch in the 1960s and with all the mind-numbing tedium that only 20th-century planning could inflict on humanity. Everything there before - natural or manmade - was simply bulldozed. A grid was imposed on the wide Potohar plateau. Each square was given a letter and number and allocated to commercial, retail or residential use, Soviet-style. Embarrassed at the resulting soullessness, the city authorities are now seeking to recapture some of the character they destroyed, as are the planners of Britain's not dissimilar Milton Keynes. Anything surviving from the past, a village, a historic landmark, even a tree, is seized on to lend character to a settlement that lacks any sense of place. The result has been the virtual demolition and rebuilding of a 16th-century village, Saidpur, on a hillside overlooking the city. A Hindu shrine has been stripped bare and made into a museum. ""Illegal residents"" have been cleared and their belongings dumped on the road, to make way for an ersatz tourism village of restaurants and boutiques: anything to suggest that Islamabad has a history. Elsewhere on the city outskirts, an old British station has been restored as a museum. At the pleading of a local artist, Fauzia Minallah, surviving banyans have been left standing, in one case in the middle of a motorway. These magnificent trees, she points out, constitute the nearest Islamabad has to ""a national heritage"". Pakistan used to pride itself on its cities being cleaner and more modern than India's. This is no longer so. While Islamabad seeks to create a past for itself, Lahore's past is collapsing around it. Hovering over its ancient walls is a sense of utter neglect, so much so that some 400 buildings have been scheduled for demolition as dangerous. The reason is rule by distant dictator. Some dictators take pride in their past, eager to make their mark on the nation's narrative. This was true of the Shah of Persia and even of Saddam Hussein. It is sad that present-day Pakistan, once a prized province of India's Mauryan, Mughal and British empires, should not only have cut itself off from that narrative but find itself at the mercy of an insecure and philistine soldier, for 10 years the puppet of London and Washington. Though eager to be admired abroad, Musharraf has allowed one of the great cities of Asia to decline into squalor. For centuries the Grand Trunk Road from Delhi through Punjab carried the history of the subcontinent streaming beneath the walls of Lahore. But while India is at least fighting to rescue what remains of its past, Lahore is left to languish. From the Indus to the Himalayas, Pakistan should be the object of every traveller's desire. Today it is awash with pessimists ready to declare its 60-year-old creation doomed and its further Balkanisation, begun with Bangladesh in 1972, inevitable. I am not sure, but any country that neglects its past loses touch with its present and endangers its future. In Pakistan the bulldozer is doing as much to hasten that danger as any suicide bomber.  simon.jenkins@theguardian.com","Simon Jenkins: Here in the city of Kim, Pakistan's magnificent history is being left to rot",2008-01-11T15:15:39Z,Simon Jenkins,world
"He was talking about moviemaking, but William Goldman's adage now officially holds true for American politics too: no-one knows anything. It's not just the pollsters and pundits who believed Hillary Clinton was on her way to defeat in New Hampshire: she believed it too. What happened instead was a turnaround on a Truman-defeats-Dewey scale. When New Hampshire anointed Bill Clinton as the Comeback Kid in 1992, he only came second. Hillary turned an expected double-digit defeat into a win. It leaves entirely wide open not only who will be elected president in November, but who the two antagonists will be. For the first time, the traditional contests in Iowa and New Hampshire have produced four different winners: Clinton and Barack Obama for the Democrats, and John McCain and Mike Huckabee for the Republicans. There are other plausible candidates still in the field. It means the two parties are engaged in a kind of double blind-date. Democrats and Republicans are picking a candidate with no idea who that person will face come November. In 2004 Democrats knew they needed someone to take on George Bush and that fact led, in part, to their selection of John Kerry. Now both sides are squaring up against a question mark. As of yesterday, it is Clinton who has the momentum. Her own team is working hard to understand how she pulled off victory in New Hampshire, so that they might repeat the trick nationwide. The key seems to be women, who made up 57% of the Democratic electorate on Tuesday and, having favoured Obama in Iowa, chose her in New Hampshire. What drew them in, the Clinton camp believes, is a dramatic sequence of events in the preceding 24 hours - events that stirred up the state's women, especially older ones. Most famously, Hillary choked up when asked how she coped with the pressure. The footage was repeated in a virtual loop on American TV and seems to have done Hillary a favour, revealing a vulnerable side that had been hidden for 16 years. But also important was the criticism of those tears by the rival candidate John Edwards, saying America needed toughness in its commander-in-chief. Alongside it was a heckling incident during a Clinton event, when a couple of men held up placards bearing the once-common anti-feminist slogan ""Iron my shirt"" (some bloggers wonder if the hecklers weren't in fact pro-Hillary plants). Add to that a male-dominated punditocracy, on TV round the clock, gleefully writing off Hillary's chances, and you have the ingredients of a women's revolt. ""They just hit a complete breaking point,"" one Hillary adviser told me yesterday. ""They were outraged."" All this suggests a fascinating shift. At the weekend, after Obama's win in Iowa, America was debating race, congratulating itself - prematurely it now seems - on at last transcending the fatal flaw that has blighted the republic from the days of slavery to segregation. Now it is gender politics that's at issue. Is Hillary held to a double standard? Or does she want it both ways, to be treated equally yet playing the victim when under fire from mostly male critics? Once again the US presidential system, especially its primary phase with its oft criticised focus on personalities, has shown its uncanny knack for airing the defining social issues of the age. Still, a combination of sympathy and sisterly solidarity is unlikely to be enough to carry Clinton to the nomination. In her victory speech, she said that she had at last found her voice. More prosaically, she has at least found a better message, speaking less about herself and her experience and more about the voters. She is staking out policy ground slightly to the left of Obama on domestic issues, and noticeably won the votes of those on lower incomes and without college degrees. In the words of that Clinton adviser: ""If you have a social need, you're with Hillary. If you want Obama to be your imaginary hip black friend and you're young and you have no social needs, then he's cool."" She now insists that it is action (her), not words (Obama), that matters when picking a president, turning Obama's eloquence against him. It's a judo move Gordon Brown should use against David Cameron: the better your opponent speaks, the more it proves he's ""all talk"". Obama now faces the toughest fight of his career. He's lost momentum but also the precious sense that held after Iowa that he was not so much a candidate as a movement. His soaring rhetoric suggested that a historic moment had arrived, one that would deliver the first African-American president. For a while, even conservative commentators praised Obama as if it would be somehow un-American to oppose the new Martin Luther King. Perhaps Obama needed that kind of wave, but New Hampshire has broken it. Now he has to compete in big states that will be settled by expensive TV advertising and ground organisation rather than by rallies and speeches, conditions that should favour Clinton. The aura of sainthood now punctured, Obama will surely face tougher scrutiny of his positions. Most depressing, Obama has to consider the possibility that when the ballot is secret, as it was in New Hampshire and as it was not in Iowa, then he is vulnerable to the tendency of voters to tell pollsters that they will vote for a black candidate - only to do otherwise in the privacy of the polling booth. For plenty of people, especially those outside the US, the only question that really matters is which of these two could beat the Republican in November. It's too early to predict, but let's imagine John McCain becomes the Republican nominee. McCain has a maverick reputation, but he is a foreign policy hawk: he is the proud author of the ""surge"" in Iraq and has joked about bombing Iran. Yet his life story - a Vietnam war hero and former PoW - is compelling and appealing. Obama would surely look woefully inexperienced against him. But in a direct contest McCain's candid, man-against-the-machine style would contrast well with the often robotic, technocratic Clinton, too. This is the great risk of Hillary. I've watched her since that 1992 campaign and I can't help but doubt that she could ever get the American people to elect her: she carries so much baggage and so many people can't stand her. So if New Hampshire's lead is followed by the nation, this could be the legacy of Tuesday night - a clash of McCain v Clinton that ends with four more Republican years in the White House. freedland@theguardian.com",Jonathan Freedland: Clinton's amazing comeback could yet crown McCain,2008-01-10T15:15:31Z,Jonathan Freedland,world
